Book 01 Genesis
001:001 In the beginning God{After "God," the Hebrew has the two letters
        "Aleph Tav" (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet)
        as a grammatical marker.} created the heavens and the earth.
001:002 Now the earth was formless and empty.  Darkness was on the surface
        of the deep.  God's Spirit was hovering over the surface
        of the waters.
001:003 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
001:004 God saw the light, and saw that it was good.  God divided
        the light from the darkness.
001:005 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
        There was evening and there was morning, one day.
001:006 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters,
        and let it divide the waters from the waters."
001:007 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under
        the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse;
        and it was so.
001:008 God called the expanse sky.  There was evening and there
        was morning, a second day.
001:009 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together
        to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.
001:010 God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together
        of the waters he called Seas.  God saw that it was good.
001:011 God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed,
        and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed
        in it, on the earth;" and it was so.
001:012 The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind,
        and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind;
        and God saw that it was good.
001:013 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
001:014 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to
        divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
        and for seasons, and for days and years;
001:015 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light
        on the earth;" and it was so.
001:016 God made the two great lights:  the greater light to rule
        the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
        He also made the stars.
001:017 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
001:018 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
        the light from the darkness.  God saw that it was good.
001:019 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
001:020 God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures,
        and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."
001:021 God created the large sea creatures, and every living
        creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed,
        after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.
        God saw that it was good.
001:022 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
        the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
001:023 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
001:024 God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after
        their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth
        after their kind;" and it was so.
001:025 God made the animals of the earth after their kind,
        and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps
        on the ground after its kind.  God saw that it was good.
001:026 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
        and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock,
        and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
        creeps on the earth."
001:027 God created man in his own image.  In God's image he created him;
        male and female he created them.
001:028 God blessed them.  God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply,
        fill the earth, and subdue it.  Have dominion over the fish
        of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living
        thing that moves on the earth."
001:029 God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed,
        which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree,
        which bears fruit yielding seed.  It will be your food.
001:030 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky,
        and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life,
        I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.
001:031 God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.
        There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
002:001 The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.
002:002 On the seventh day God finished his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which
        he had made.
002:003 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested
        in it from all his work which he had created and made.
002:004 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of
        the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God
        made the earth and the heavens.
002:005 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of
        the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it
        to rain on the earth.  There was not a man to till the ground,
002:006 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole
        surface of the ground.
002:007 Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground,
        and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
        became a living soul.
002:008 Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put
        the man whom he had formed.
002:009 Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is
        pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
        also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge
        of good and evil.
002:010 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there
        it was parted, and became four heads.
002:011 The name of the first is Pishon:  this is the one which flows
        through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
002:012 and the gold of that land is good.  There is aromatic resin
        and the onyx stone.
002:013 The name of the second river is Gihon:  the same river that flows
        through the whole land of Cush.
002:014 The name of the third river is Hiddekel:  this is the one which
        flows in front of Assyria.  The fourth river is the Euphrates.
002:015 Yahweh God took the man, and put him iht silence, the scenes of mimic life, of imaged
trial, that often occupy the musing mind; let it be such a work, so
drawn, so coloured, and who shall pronounce it inferior? Who rather
will not confess that it presents a picturOut of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is
        pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
        also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge
        of good and evil.
002:010 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there
        it was parted, and became four heads.
002:011 The name of the first is Pishon:  this is the one which flows
        through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
002:012 and the gold of that land is good.  There is aromatic resin
        and the onyx stone.
002:013 The name of the second river is Gihon:  the same river that flows
        through the whole land of Cush.
002:014 The name of the third river is Hiddekel:  this is the one which
        flows in front of Assyria.  The fourth river is the Euphrates.
002:015 Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden
        to dress it and to keep it.
002:016 Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden
        you may freely eat;
002:017 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall
        not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you
        will surely die."
002:018 Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone;
        I will make him a helper suitable for him."
002:019 Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field,
        and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see
        what he would call them.  Whatever the man called every
        living creature, that was its name.
002:020 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky,
        and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not
        found a helper suitable for him.
002:021 Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept;
        and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        in its place.
002:022 He made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man,
        into a woman, and brought her to the man.
002:023 The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.
        She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
002:024 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother,
        and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.
002:025 They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
003:001 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field
        which Yahweh God had made.  He said to the woman, "Has God
        really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"
003:002 The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees
        of the garden we may eat,
003:003 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden,
        God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you
        touch it, lest you die.'"
003:004 The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die,
003:005 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened,
        and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
003:006 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
        was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired
        to make one wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate;
        and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.
003:007 The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew
        that they were naked.  They sewed fig leaves together,
        and made themselves aprons.
003:008 They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in
        the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
003:009 Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
003:010 The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
        because I was naked; and I hid myself."
003:011 God said, "Who told you that you were naked?  Have you eaten
        from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
003:012 The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
003:013 Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"
        The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
003:014 Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this,
        cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal
        of the field.  On your belly shall you go, and you shall eat
        dust all the days of your life.
003:015 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
        offspring and her offspring.  He will bruise your head,
        and you will bruise his heel."
003:016 To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain
        in childbirth.  In pain you will bring forth children.
        Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
003:017 To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice,
        and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying,
        'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake.
        In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
003:018 Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you;
        and you will eat the herb of the field.
003:019 By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you
        return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.
        For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
003:020 The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother
        of all living.
003:021 Yahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife,
        and clothed them.
003:022 Yahweh God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us,
        knowing good and evil.  Now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."
003:023 Therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from which he was taken.
003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east
        of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned
        every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
004:001 The man knew Eve his wife.  She conceived, and gave birth to Cain,
        and said, "I have gotten a man with Yahweh's help."
004:002 Again she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel.  Abel was a keeper
        of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
004:003 As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering
        to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.
004:004 Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of
        the fat of it.  Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,
004:005 but he didn't respect Cain and his offering.  Cain was very angry,
        and the expression on his face fell.
004:006 Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry?  Why has the expression
        of your face fallen?
004:007 If you do well, will it not be lifted up?  If you don't do well,
        sin crouches at the door.  Its desire is for you, but you
        are to rule over it."
004:008 Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field."
        It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up
        against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
004:009 Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"
        He said, "I don't know.  Am I my brother's keeper?"
004:010 Yahweh said, "What have you done?  The voice of your brother's
        blood cries to me from the ground.
004:011 Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened
        its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
004:012 From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its
        strength to you.  You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer
        in the earth."
004:013 Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
004:014 Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface
        of the ground.  I will be hidden from your face,
        and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.
        It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."
004:015 Yahweh said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will
        be taken on him sevenfold."  Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain,
        lest any finding him should strike him.
004:016 Cain went out from Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land
        of Nod, east of Eden.
004:017 Cain knew his wife.  She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch.
        He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name
        of his son, Enoch.
004:018 To Enoch was born Irad.  Irad became the father of Mehujael.
        Mehujael became the father of Methushael.  Methushael became
        the father of Lamech.
004:019 Lamech took two wives:  the name of the one was Adah,
        and the name of the other Zillah.
004:020 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell
        in tents and have livestock.
004:021 His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who
        handle the harp and pipe.
004:022 Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting
        instrument of brass and iron.  Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.
004:023 Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
        You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain
        a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.
004:024 If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech
        seventy-seven times."
004:025 Adam knew his wife again.  She gave birth to a son, and named
        him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead
        of Abel, for Cain killed him."
004:026 There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh.
        Then men began to call on Yahweh's name.
005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam.  In the day
        that God created man, he made him in God's likeness.
005:002 He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called
        their name Adam,{"Adam" and "Man" are spelled with the exact
        same consonants in Hebrew, so this can be correctly translated
        either way.} in the day when they were created.
005:003 Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a
        son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
005:004 The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight
        hundred years, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
005:005 All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years,
        then he died.
005:006 Seth lived one hundred five years, and became the father of Enosh.
005:007 Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred
        seven years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:008 All the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years,
        then he died.
005:009 Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.
005:010 Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan, eight hundred
        fifteen years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:011 All the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.
005:012 Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel.
005:013 Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred
        forty years, and became the father of sons and daughters
005:014 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years,
        then he died.
005:015 Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared.
005:016 Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred
        thirty years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:017 All the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years,
        then he died.
005:018 Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, and became
        the father of Enoch.
005:019 Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years,
        and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:020 All the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years,
        then he died.
005:021 Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah.
005:022 Enoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah
        three hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:023 All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
005:024 Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.
005:025 Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and became
        the father of Lamech.
005:026 Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred
        eighty-two years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:027 All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years,
        then he died.
005:028 Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, and became the father
        of a son,
005:029 and he named him Noah, saying, "This same will comfort us
        in our work and in the toil of our hands, because of the ground
        which Yahweh has cursed."
005:030 Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred
        ninety-five years, and became the father of sons and daughters.
005:031 All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years,
        then he died.
005:032 Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father
        of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
006:001 It happened, when men began to multiply on the surface
        of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
006:002 that God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful,
        and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose.
006:003 Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with man forever,
        because he also is flesh; yet will his days be one
        hundred twenty years."
006:004 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also
        after that, when God's sons came in to men's daughters.
        They bore children to them.  Those were the mighty men
        who were of old, men of renown.
006:005 Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
        and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
        only evil continually.
006:006 Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it
        grieved him in his heart.
006:007 Yahweh said, "I will destroy man whom I have created
        from the surface of the ground; man, along with animals,
        creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I
        have made them."
006:008 But Noah found favor in Yahweh's eyes.
006:009 This is the history of the generations of Noah.  Noah was
        a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time.
        Noah walked with God.
006:010 Noah became the father of three sons:  Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
006:011 The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was
        filled with violence.
006:012 God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh
        had corrupted their way on the earth.
006:013 God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me,
        for the earth is filled with violence through them.
        Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
006:014 Make a ship of gopher wood.  You shall make rooms in the ship,
        and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.
006:015 This is how you shall make it.  The length of the ship will
        be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,
        and the height of it thirty cubits.
006:016 You shall make a roof in the ship, and to a cubit shall you finish
        it upward.  You shall set the door of the ship in its side.
        You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
006:017 I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy
        all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky.
        Everything that is in the earth will die.
006:018 But I will establish my covenant with you.  You shall come
        into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons'
        wives with you.
006:019 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two
        of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you.
        They shall be male and female.
006:020 Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind,
        of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind,
        two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.
006:021 Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to you;
        and it will be for food for you, and for them."
006:022 Thus Noah did.  According to all that God commanded him,
        so he did.
007:001 Yahweh said to Noah, "Come with all of your household into
        the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me
        in this generation.
007:002 You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you,
        the male and his female.  Of the animals that are not clean,
        take two, the male and his female.
007:003 Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female,
        to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.
007:004 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty
        days and forty nights.  Every living thing that I have made,
        I will destroy from the surface of the ground."
007:005 Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.
007:006 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came
        on the earth.
007:007 Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons'
        wives, because of the waters of the flood.
007:008 Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything
        that creeps on the ground
007:009 went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female,
        as God commanded Noah.
007:010 It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood
        came on the earth.
007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
        on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all
        the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's
        windows were opened.
007:012 The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
007:013 In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah,
        and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them,
        entered into the ship;
007:014 they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after
        their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
        after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird
        of every sort.
007:015 They went to Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with
        the breath of life in them.
007:016 Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
        as God commanded him; and Yahweh shut him in.
007:017 The flood was forty days on the earth.  The waters increased,
        and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
007:018 The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth;
        and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
007:019 The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth.  All the high
        mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
007:020 The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the
        mountains were covered.
007:021 All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds,
        livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth,
        and every man.
007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life,
        of all that was on the dry land, died.
007:023 Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface
        of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things,
        and birds of the sky.  They were destroyed from the earth.
        Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.
007:024 The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.
008:001 God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were
        with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth.
        The waters subsided.
008:002 The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped,
        and the rain from the sky was restrained.
008:003 The waters receded from the earth continually.  After the end
        of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.
008:004 The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day
        of the month, on Ararat's mountains.
008:005 The waters receded continually until the tenth month.
        In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops
        of the mountains were seen.
008:006 It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window
        of the ship which he had made,
008:007 and he sent forth a raven.  It went back and forth,
        until the waters were dried up from the earth.
008:008 He sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated
        from the surface of the ground,
008:009 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned
        to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface
        of the whole earth.  He put forth his hand, and took her,
        and brought her to him into the ship.
008:010 He stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent forth
        the dove out of the ship.
008:011 The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth
        was an olive leaf plucked off.  So Noah knew that the waters
        were abated from the earth.
008:012 He stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove;
        and she didn't return to him any more.
008:013 It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month,
        the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth.
        Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked.
        He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.
008:014 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
        the earth was dry.
008:015 God spoke to Noah, saying,
008:016 "Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons,
        and your sons' wives with you.
008:017 Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you
        of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping
        thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly
        in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."
008:018 Noah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him.
008:019 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves
        on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
008:020 Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal,
        and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings
        on the altar.
008:021 Yahweh smelled the sweet savor.  Yahweh said in his heart,
        "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake,
        because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;
        neither will I ever again strike everything living,
        as I have done.
008:022 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat,
        and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
009:001 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful,
        and multiply, and replenish the earth.
009:002 The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every
        animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.
        Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish
        of the sea are delivered into your hand.
009:003 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you.
        As the green herb, I have given everything to you.
009:004 But flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat.
009:005 I will surely require your blood of your lives.
        At the hand of every animal I will require it.
        At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother,
        I will require the life of man.
009:006 Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man,
        for God made man in his own image.
009:007 Be fruitful and multiply.  Bring forth abundantly in the earth,
        and multiply in it."
009:008 God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
009:009 "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you,
        and with your offspring after you,
009:010 and with every living creature that is with you:  the birds,
        the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you,
        of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
009:011 I will establish my covenant with you:  all flesh will not be cut
        off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there
        ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."
009:012 God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make
        between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
        for perpetual generations:
009:013 I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign
        of a covenant between me and the earth.
009:014 It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
        that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
009:015 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
        and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will
        no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
009:016 The rainbow will be in the cloud.  I will look at it, that I
        may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every
        living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
009:017 God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I
        have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
009:018 The sons of Noah who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth.  Ham is the father of Canaan.
009:019 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole
        earth was populated.
009:020 Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.
009:021 He drank of the wine and got drunk.  He was uncovered
        within his tent.
009:022 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
        and told his two brothers outside.
009:023 Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders,
        went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father.
        Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see
        their father's nakedness.
009:024 Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had
        done to him.
009:025 He said, "Canaan is cursed.  He will be servant of servants
        to his brothers."
009:026 He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.  Let Canaan
        be his servant.
009:027 May God enlarge Japheth.  Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
        Let Canaan be his servant."
009:028 Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.
009:029 All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.
010:001 Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah
        and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  Sons were born to them
        after the flood.
010:002 The sons of Japheth:  Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,
        and Tiras.
010:003 The sons of Gomer:  Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
010:004 The sons of Javan:  Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
010:005 Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands,
        everyone after his language, after their families,
        in their nations.
010:006 The sons of Ham:  Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
010:007 The sons of Cush:  Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.
        The sons of Raamah:  Sheba and Dedan.
010:008 Cush became the father of Nimrod.  He began to be a mighty
        one in the earth.
010:009 He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh.  Therefore it is said,
        "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."
010:010 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh,
        in the land of Shinar.
010:011 Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and built
        Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
010:012 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
010:013 Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
010:014 Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from),
        and Caphtorim.
010:015 Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,
010:016 the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,
010:017 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,
010:018 the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite.
        Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
010:019 The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go
        toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,
        and Zeboiim, to Lasha.
010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families,
        after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
010:021 To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder
        brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
010:022 The sons of Shem:  Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
010:023 The sons of Aram:  Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
010:024 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah.  Shelah became
        the father of Eber.
010:025 To Eber were born two sons.  The name of the one was Peleg,
        for in his days the earth was divided.  His brother's
        name was Joktan.
010:026 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
010:027 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
010:028 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
010:029 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.  All these were the sons of Joktan.
010:030 Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar,
        the mountain of the east.
010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families,
        after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.
010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
        in their nations.  Of these were the nations divided in the earth
        after the flood.
011:001 The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
011:002 It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain
        in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
011:003 They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn
        them thoroughly."  They had brick for stone, and they used
        tar for mortar.
011:004 They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower
        whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name,
        lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."
011:005 Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children
        of men built.
011:006 Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have
        all one language, and this is what they begin to do.
        Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
011:007 Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language,
        that they may not understand one another's speech."
011:008 So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface
        of all the earth.  They stopped building the city.
011:009 Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because there
        Yahweh confused the language of all the earth.  From there,
        Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
011:010 This is the history of the generations of Shem.  Shem was
        one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad
        two years after the flood.
011:011 Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father
        of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:012 Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.
011:013 Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father
        of Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:014 Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber:
011:015 and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became
        the father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:016 Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.
011:017 Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father
        of Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:018 Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.
011:019 Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father
        of Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:020 Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.
011:021 Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father
        of Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:022 Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.
011:023 Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor,
        and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:024 Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.
011:025 Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father
        of Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
011:026 Terah lived seventy years, and became the father
        of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
011:027 Now this is the history of the generations of Terah.
        Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
        Haran became the father of Lot.
011:028 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth,
        in Ur of the Chaldees.
011:029 Abram and Nahor took wives.  The name of Abram's wife was Sarai,
        and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran
        who was also the father of Iscah.
011:030 Sarai was barren.  She had no child.
011:031 Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son,
        and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife.  They went
        forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan.
        They came to Haran and lived there.
011:032 The days of Terah were two hundred five years.
        Terah died in Haran.
012:001 Now Yahweh said to Abram, "Get out of your country,
        and from your relatives, and from your father's house,
        to the land that I will show you.
012:002 I will make of you a great nation.  I will bless you and make
        your name great.  You will be a blessing.
012:003 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him
        who curses you.  In you will all of the families of the
        earth be blessed."
012:004 So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him.  Lot went with him.
        Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.
012:005 Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance
        that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten
        in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan.
        Into the land of Canaan they came.
012:006 Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem,
        to the oak of Moreh.  The Canaanite was then in the land.
012:007 Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to
        your seed{or, offspring}." He built an altar there to Yahweh,
        who appeared to him.
012:008 He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel,
        and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai
        on the east.  There he built an altar to Yahweh and called
        on the name of Yahweh.
012:009 Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.
012:010 There was a famine in the land.  Abram went down into Egypt
        to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe
        in the land.
012:011 It happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said
        to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful
        woman to look at.
012:012 It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they
        will say, 'This is his wife.'  They will kill me, but they
        will save you alive.
012:013 Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me
        for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."
012:014 It happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians
        saw that the woman was very beautiful.
012:015 The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh;
        and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
012:016 He dealt well with Abram for her sake.  He had sheep,
        oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants,
        female donkeys, and camels.
012:017 Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
        because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
012:018 Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done
        to me?  Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?
012:019 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her
        to be my wife?  Now therefore, see your wife, take her,
        and go your way."
012:020 Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him, and they brought him
        on the way with his wife and all that he had.
013:001 Abram went up out of Egypt:  he, his wife, all that he had,
        and Lot with him, into the South.
013:002 Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
013:003 He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel,
        to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
        between Bethel and Ai,
013:004 to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first.
        There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.
013:005 Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
013:006 The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together:
        for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.
013:007 There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock
        and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock:  and the Canaanite
        and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.
013:008 Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between
        me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen;
        for we are relatives.
013:009 Isn't the whole land before you?  Please separate yourself from me.
        If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right.
        Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
013:010 Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan,
        that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed
        Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land
        of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
013:011 So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself.
        Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one
        from the other.
013:012 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities
        of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
013:013 Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners
        against Yahweh.
013:014 Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now,
        lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are,
        northward and southward and eastward and westward,
013:015 for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to
        your offspring forever.
013:016 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that
        if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed
        may also be numbered.
013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
        of it; for I will give it to you."
013:018 Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre,
        which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.
014:001 It happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch,
        king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal,
        king of Goiim,
014:002 that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha,
        king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber,
        king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
014:003 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same
        is the Salt Sea).
014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
        year, they rebelled.
014:005 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who
        were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim,
        and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
014:006 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is
        by the wilderness.
014:007 They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh),
        and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites,
        that lived in Hazazon Tamar.
014:008 The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king
        of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
        (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array
        against them in the valley of Siddim;
014:009 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
        and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
        four kings against the five.
014:010 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings
        of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those
        who remained fled to the hills.
014:011 They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food,
        and went their way.
014:012 They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom,
        and his goods, and departed.
014:013 One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew.
        Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol,
        and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.
014:014 When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth
        his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen,
        and pursued as far as Dan.
014:015 He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants,
        and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left
        hand of Damascus.
014:016 He brought back all the goods, and also brought back
        his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also,
        and the people.
014:017 The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from
        the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him,
        at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
014:018 Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine:
        and he was priest of God Most High.
014:019 He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High,
        possessor of heaven and earth:
014:020 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies
        into your hand."  Abram gave him a tenth of all.
014:021 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people,
        and take the goods to yourself."
014:022 Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand
        to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
014:023 that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything
        that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
014:024 I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men
        have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me:
        Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.  Let them take their portion."
015:001 After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in
        a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram.  I am your shield,
        your exceedingly great reward."
015:002 Abram said, "Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I
        go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is
        Eliezer of Damascus?"
015:003 Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed:
        and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."
015:004 Behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will
        not be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own
        body will be your heir."
015:005 Yahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky,
        and count the stars, if you are able to count them."
        He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."
015:006 He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
015:007 He said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur
        of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."
015:008 He said, "Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
015:009 He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female
        goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove,
        and a young pigeon."
015:010 He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle,
        and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't
        divide the birds.
015:011 The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram
        drove them away.
015:012 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram.
        Now terror and great darkness fell on him.
015:013 He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as
        foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them.
        They will afflict them four hundred years.
015:014 I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.
        Afterward they will come out with great wealth,
015:015 but you will go to your fathers in peace.  You will be buried
        in a good old age.
015:016 In the fourth generation they will come here again,
        for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."
015:017 It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it
        was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch
        passed between these pieces.
015:018 In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your
        seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to
        the great river, the river Euphrates:
015:019 the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
015:020 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
015:021 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
016:001 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children.  She had a handmaid,
        an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
016:002 Sarai said to Abram, "See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing.
        Please go in to my handmaid.  It may be that I will obtain
        children by her."  Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
016:003 Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid,
        after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan,
        and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
016:004 He went in to Hagar, and she conceived.  When she saw that she
        had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
016:005 Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong is your fault.
        I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw
        that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes.
        Yahweh judge between me and you."
016:006 But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand.
        Do to her whatever is good in your eyes."  Sarai dealt harshly
        with her, and she fled from her face.
016:007 The angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in
        the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
016:008 He said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from?
        Where are you going?"  She said, "I am fleeing from the face
        of my mistress Sarai."
016:009 The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Return to your mistress,
        and submit yourself under her hands."
016:010 The angel of Yahweh said to her, "I will greatly multiply
        your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude."
016:011 The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Behold, you are with child,
        and will bear a son.  You shall call his name Ishmael,
        because Yahweh has heard your affliction.
016:012 He will be like a wild donkey among men.  His hand will
        be against every man, and every man's hand against him.
        He will live opposite all of his brothers."
016:013 She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, "You are
        a God who sees," for she said, "Have I even stayed alive
        after seeing him?"
016:014 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.{Beer Lahai Roi
        means "well of the one who lives and sees me."} Behold,
        it is between Kadesh and Bered.
016:015 Hagar bore a son for Abram.  Abram called the name of his son,
        whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
016:016 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
017:001 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram,
        and said to him, "I am God Almighty.  Walk before me,
        and be blameless.
017:002 I will make my covenant between me and you, and will
        multiply you exceedingly."
017:003 Abram fell on his face.  God talked with him, saying,
017:004 "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you.  You will be
        the father of a multitude of nations.
017:005 Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your
        name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a
        multitude of nations.
017:006 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you.
        Kings will come out of you.
017:007 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed
        after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant,
        to be a God to you and to your seed after you.
017:008 I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land
        where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an
        everlasting possession.  I will be their God."
017:009 God said to Abraham, "As for you, you will keep my covenant,
        you and your seed after you throughout their generations.
017:010 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me
        and you and your seed after you.  Every male among you
        shall be circumcised.
017:011 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin.
        It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.
017:012 He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you,
        every male throughout your generations, he who is born
        in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is
        not of your seed.
017:013 He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money,
        must be circumcised.  My covenant will be in your flesh
        for an everlasting covenant.
017:014 The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh
        of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
        He has broken my covenant."
017:015 God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not
        call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah.
017:016 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her.
        Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations.
        Kings of peoples will come from her."
017:017 Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
        "Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old?
        Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"
017:018 Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
017:019 God said, "No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son.
        You shall call his name Isaac.{Isaac means "he laughs."} I
        will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant
        for his seed after him.
017:020 As for Ishmael, I have heard you.  Behold, I have blessed him,
        and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly.
        He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make
        him a great nation.
017:021 But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear
        to you at this set time next year."
017:022 When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
017:023 Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house,
        and all who were bought with his money; every male among
        the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their
        foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.
017:024 Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised
        in the flesh of his foreskin.
017:025 Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised
        in the flesh of his foreskin.
017:026 In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.
017:027 All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those
        bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
018:001 Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat
        in the tent door in the heat of the day.
018:002 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men
        stood opposite him.  When he saw them, he ran to meet them
        from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
018:003 and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight,
        please don't go away from your servant.
018:004 Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest
        yourselves under the tree.
018:005 I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart.
        After that you may go your way, now that you have come to
        your servant."  They said, "Very well, do as you have said."
018:006 Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly make
        ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
018:007 Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf,
        and gave it to the servant.  He hurried to dress it.
018:008 He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
        and set it before them.  He stood by them under the tree,
        and they ate.
018:009 They said to him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?
        He said, "See, in the tent."
018:010 He said, "I will certainly return to you when the season
        comes round.  Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son."
        Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age.
        It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
018:012 Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old
        will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
018:013 Yahweh said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I
        really bear a child, yet I am old?'
018:014 Is anything too hard for Yahweh?  At the set time I will return
        to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son."
018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for she was afraid.
        He said, "No, but you did laugh."
018:016 The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom.
        Abraham went with them to see them on their way.
018:017 Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do,
018:018 seeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation,
        and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
018:019 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his
        children and his household after him, that they may keep
        the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice;
        to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has
        spoken of him."
018:020 Yahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
        and because their sin is very grievous,
018:021 I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad
        as the reports which have come to me.  If not, I will know."
018:022 The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham
        stood yet before Yahweh.
018:023 Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous
        with the wicked?
018:024 What if there are fifty righteous within the city?
        Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty
        righteous who are in it?
018:025 Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous
        with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked.
        May that be far from you.  Shouldn't the Judge of all
        the earth do right?"
018:026 Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
        then I will spare all the place for their sake."
018:027 Abraham answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak
        to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.
018:028 What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous?
        Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?"  He said,
        "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
018:029 He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty
        found there?"  He said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."
018:030 He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.
        What if there are thirty found there?"  He said, "I will not
        do it, if I find thirty there."
018:031 He said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.
        What if there are twenty found there?"  He said, "I will not
        destroy it for the twenty's sake."
018:032 He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will
        speak just once more.  What if ten are found there?"
        He said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
018:033 Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing
        with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
019:001 The two angels came to Sodom at evening.  Lot sat in the gate
        of Sodom.  Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them.
        He bowed himself with his face to the earth,
019:002 and he said, "See now, my lords, please turn aside into
        your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet,
        and you will rise up early, and go on your way."
        They said, "No, but we will stay in the street all night."
019:003 He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered
        into his house.  He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,
        and they ate.
019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom,
        surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people
        from every quarter.
019:005 They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men
        who came in to you this night?  Bring them out to us,
        that we may have sex with them."
019:006 Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
019:007 He said, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.
019:008 See now, I have two virgin daughters.  Please let me bring them
        out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you.
        Only don't do anything to these men, because they have come
        under the shadow of my roof."
019:009 They said, "Stand back!"  They said, "This one fellow came
        in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge.
        Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!"
        They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.
019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house
        to them, and shut the door.
019:011 They struck the men who were at the door of the house
        with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied
        themselves to find the door.
019:012 The men said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here?
        Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you
        have in the city, bring them out of the place:
019:013 for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against
        them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us
        to destroy it."
019:014 Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were
        pledged to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up!
        Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city."
        But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
019:015 When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up!
        Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here,
        lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
019:016 But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand,
        and his two daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him;
        and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.
019:017 It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said,
        "Escape for your life!  Don't look behind you, and don't
        stay anywhere in the plain.  Escape to the mountains,
        lest you be consumed!"
019:018 Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord.
019:019 See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you
        have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown
        to me in saving my life.  I can't escape to the mountain,
        lest evil overtake me, and I die.
019:020 See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.
        Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my
        soul will live."
019:021 He said to him, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning
        this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which
        you have spoken.
019:022 Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there."
        Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.{Zoar means "little."}
019:023 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
019:024 Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire
        from Yahweh out of the sky.
019:025 He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants
        of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became
        a pillar of salt.
019:027 Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had
        stood before Yahweh.
019:028 He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land
        of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land
        went up as the smoke of a furnace.
019:029 It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
        that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle
        of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
019:030 Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his
        two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar.
        He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
019:031 The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old,
        and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after
        the manner of all the earth.
019:032 Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
        that we may preserve our father's seed."
019:033 They made their father drink wine that night:
        and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father.
        He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
019:034 It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said
        to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father.
        Let us make him drink wine again, tonight.  You go in,
        and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed."
019:035 They made their father drink wine that night also.
        The younger went and lay with him.  He didn't know when she
        lay down, nor when she got up.
019:036 Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father.
019:037 The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.  He is the father
        of the Moabites to this day.
019:038 The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi.
        He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
020:001 Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived
        between Kadesh and Shur.  He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.
020:002 Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister."
        Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said
        to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman
        whom you have taken.  For she is a man's wife."
020:004 Now Abimelech had not come near her.  He said, "Lord, will you
        kill even a righteous nation?
020:005 Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister?'  She, even she herself,
        said, 'He is my brother.'  In the integrity of my heart
        and the innocence of my hands have I done this."
020:006 God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity
        of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you
        from sinning against me.  Therefore I didn't allow you
        to touch her.
020:007 Now therefore, restore the man's wife.  For he is a prophet,
        and he will pray for you, and you will live.  If you don't
        restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all
        who are yours."
020:008 Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
        his servants, and told all these things in their ear.
        The men were very scared.
020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him,
        "What have you done to us?  How have I sinned against you,
        that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?
        You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!"
020:010 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have
        done this thing?"
020:011 Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is
        not in this place.  They will kill me for my wife's sake.'
020:012 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father,
        but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
020:013 It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house,
        that I said to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show
        to me.  Everywhere that we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"
020:014 Abimelech took sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants,
        and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.
020:015 Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you.
        Dwell where it pleases you."
020:016 To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand
        pieces of silver.  Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes
        to all that are with you.  In front of all you are vindicated."
020:017 Abraham prayed to God.  God healed Abimelech, and his wife,
        and his female servants, and they bore children.
020:018 For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house
        of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
021:001 Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah
        as he had spoken.
021:002 Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age,
        at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
021:003 Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore
        to him, Isaac.{Isaac means "He laughs."}
021:004 Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old,
        as God had commanded him.
021:005 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac,
        was born to him.
021:006 Sarah said, "God has made me laugh.  Everyone who hears will
        laugh with me."
021:007 She said, "Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would
        nurse children?  For I have borne him a son in his old age."
021:008 The child grew, and was weaned.  Abraham made a great feast
        on the day that Isaac was weaned.
021:009 Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne
        to Abraham, mocking.
021:010 Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son!
        For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."
021:011 The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account
        of his son.
021:012 God said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your
        sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid.
        In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice.
        For from Isaac will your seed be called.
021:013 I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid,
        because he is your seed."
021:014 Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle
        of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder;
        and gave her the child, and sent her away.  She departed,
        and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
021:015 The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child
        under one of the shrubs.
021:016 She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow
        shot away.  For she said, "Don't let me see the death of the child."
        She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
021:017 God heard the voice of the boy.  The angel of God called
        to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails
        you, Hagar?  Don't be afraid.  For God has heard the voice
        of the boy where he is.
021:018 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand.
        For I will make him a great nation."
021:019 God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.  She went,
        filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.
021:020 God was with the boy, and he grew.  He lived in the wilderness,
        and became, as he grew up, an archer.
021:021 He lived in the wilderness of Paran.  His mother took a wife
        for him out of the land of Egypt.
021:022 It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain
        of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all
        that you do.
021:023 Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal
        falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son.
        But according to the kindness that I have done to you,
        you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived
        as a foreigner."
021:024 Abraham said, "I will swear."
021:025 Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well,
        which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
021:026 Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing.
        Neither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."
021:027 Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech.
        Those two made a covenant.
021:028 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
021:029 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs
        which you have set by themselves mean?"
021:030 He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand,
        that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well."
021:031 Therefore he called that place Beersheba,{Beersheba can
        mean "well of the oath" or "well of seven."} because they
        both swore there.
021:032 So they made a covenant at Beersheba.  Abimelech rose up
        with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned
        into the land of the Philistines.
021:033 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there
        on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.
021:034 Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines
        many days.
022:001 It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham,
        and said to him, "Abraham!"  He said, "Here I am."
022:002 He said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love,
        even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah.  Offer him there
        for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will
        tell you of."
022:003 Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey,
        and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son.
        He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up,
        and went to the place of which God had told him.
022:004 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw
        the place far off.
022:005 Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey.
        The boy and I will go yonder.  We will worship, and come
        back to you."
022:006 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on
        Isaac his son.  He took in his hand the fire and the knife.
        They both went together.
022:007 Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?"
        He said, "Here I am, my son."  He said, "Here is the fire
        and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
022:008 Abraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering,
        my son."  So they both went together.
022:009 They came to the place which God had told him of.
        Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order,
        bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.
022:010 Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
        kill his son.
022:011 The angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said,
        "Abraham, Abraham!"  He said, "Here I am."
022:012 He said, "Don't lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him.
        For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld
        your son, your only son, from me."
022:013 Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind
        him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.
        Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt
        offering instead of his son.
022:014 Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide{or,
        Yahweh-Jireh, or, Yahweh-Seeing}. As it is said to this day,
        "On Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided."
022:015 The angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out
        of the sky,
022:016 and said, "I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you
        have done this thing, and have not withheld your son,
        your only son,
022:017 that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed
        greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand
        which is on the seashore.  Your seed will possess the gate
        of his enemies.
022:018 In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,
        because you have obeyed my voice."
022:019 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went
        together to Beersheba.  Abraham lived at Beersheba.
022:020 It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham,
        saying, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to
        your brother Nahor:
022:021 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
022:022 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
022:023 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.  These eight Milcah bore
        to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
022:024 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore
        Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
023:001 Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years.  This was the length
        of Sarah's life.
023:002 Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land
        of Canaan.  Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
023:003 Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children
        of Heth, saying,
023:004 "I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you.
        Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I
        may bury my dead out of my sight."
023:005 The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
023:006 "Hear us, my lord.  You are a prince of God among us.
        Bury your dead in the best of our tombs.  None of us will
        withhold from you his tomb.  Bury your dead."
023:007 Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
        even to the children of Heth.
023:008 He talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should
        bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me
        to Ephron the son of Zohar,
023:009 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has,
        which is in the end of his field.  For the full price let him
        give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."
023:010 Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth.
        Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of
        the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate
        of his city, saying,
023:011 "No, my lord, hear me.  I give you the field, and I give you
        the cave that is in it.  In the presence of the children
        of my people I give it to you.  Bury your dead."
023:012 Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
023:013 He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of
        the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me.
        I will give the price of the field.  Take it from me,
        and I will bury my dead there."
023:014 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
023:015 "My lord, listen to me.  What is a piece of land worth
        four hundred shekels of silver between me and you?
        Therefore bury your dead."
023:016 Abraham listened to Ephron.  Abraham weighed to Ephron
        the silver which he had named in the audience of the children
        of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the
        current merchants' standard.
023:017 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was
        before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it,
        and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all
        of its borders, were deeded
023:018 to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
        of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
023:019 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave
        of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron),
        in the land of Canaan.
023:020 The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham
        for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.
024:001 Abraham was old, and well stricken in age.  Yahweh had blessed
        Abraham in all things.
024:002 Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled
        over all that he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh.
024:003 I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God
        of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son
        of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.
024:004 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take
        a wife for my son Isaac."
024:005 The servant said to him, "What if the woman isn't willing
        to follow me to this land?  Must I bring your son again
        to the land you came from?"
024:006 Abraham said to him, "Beware that you don't bring my
        son there again.
024:007 Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house,
        and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore
        to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your seed{or, offspring}.'
        He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife
        for my son from there.
024:008 If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall
        be clear from this my oath.  Only you shall not bring my
        son there again."
024:009 The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
        and swore to him concerning this matter.
024:010 The servant took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed,
        having a variety of good things of his master's with him.
        He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
024:011 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well
        of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out
        to draw water.
024:012 He said, "Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me
        success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
024:013 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water.  The daughters
        of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
024:014 Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say,
        'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and she
        will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'--
        let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac.
        By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
024:015 It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold,
        Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah,
        the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
        on her shoulder.
024:016 The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin,
        neither had any man known her.  She went down to the spring,
        filled her pitcher, and came up.
024:017 The servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink,
        a little water from your pitcher."
024:018 She said, "Drink, my lord."  She hurried, and let down her
        pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.
024:019 When she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw
        for your camels, until they have done drinking."
024:020 She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
        again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
024:021 The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know
        whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.
024:022 It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
        took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets
        for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
024:023 and said, "Whose daughter are you?  Please tell me.
        Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"
024:024 She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,
        whom she bore to Nahor."
024:025 She said moreover to him, "We have both straw and provender enough,
        and room to lodge in."
024:026 The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.
024:027 He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has
        not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master.
        As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of
        my master's relatives."
024:028 The young lady ran, and told her mother's house about these words.
024:029 Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban.  Laban ran
        out to the man, to the spring.
024:030 It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his
        sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah
        his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me,"
        that he came to the man.  Behold, he was standing by the camels
        at the spring.
024:031 He said, "Come in, you blessed of Yahweh.  Why do you stand outside?
        For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
024:032 The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels.
        He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
        his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
024:033 Food was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat
        until I have told my message."  He said, "Speak on."
024:034 He said, "I am Abraham's servant.
024:035 Yahweh has blessed my master greatly.  He has become great.
        He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold,
        male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
024:036 Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old.
        He has given all that he has to him.
024:037 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife
        for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
        land I live,
024:038 but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives,
        and take a wife for my son.'
024:039 I said to my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?'
024:040 He said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his
        angel with you, and prosper your way.  You shall take a wife
        for my son of my relatives, and of my father's house.
024:041 Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives.
        If they don't give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.'
024:042 I came this day to the spring, and said, 'Yahweh, the God
        of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go--
024:043 behold, I am standing by this spring of water.  Let it happen,
        that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say,
        "Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
024:044 and she will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for
        your camels,"--let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed
        for my master's son.'
024:045 Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth
        with her pitcher on her shoulder.  She went down to the spring,
        and drew.  I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
024:046 She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
        and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.'
        So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
024:047 I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?'  She said,
        'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.'
        I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.
024:048 I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh,
        the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way
        to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
024:049 Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me.
        If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand,
        or to the left."
024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from Yahweh.
        We can't speak to you bad or good.
024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before you.  Take her, and go, and let
        her be your master's son's wife, as Yahweh has spoken."
024:052 It happened that when Abraham's servant heard their words,
        he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.
024:053 The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
        and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah.  He also gave precious
        things to her brother and her mother.
024:054 They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him,
        and stayed all night.  They rose up in the morning, and he said,
        "Send me away to my master."
024:055 Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay
        with us a few days, at least ten.  After that she will go."
024:056 He said to them, "Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered
        my way.  Send me away that I may go to my master."
024:057 They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her."
024:058 They called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?"
        She said, "I will go."
024:059 They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse,
        Abraham's servant, and his men.
024:060 They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you
        be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed
        possess the gate of those who hate them."
024:061 Rebekah arose with her ladies.  They rode on the camels,
        and followed the man.  The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
024:062 Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived
        in the land of the South.
024:063 Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening.
        He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there
        were camels coming.
024:064 Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,
        she dismounted from the camel.
024:065 She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in
        the field to meet us?"  The servant said, "It is my master."
        She took her veil, and covered herself.
024:066 The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
024:067 Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,
        and took Rebekah, and she became his wife.  He loved her.
        Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
025:001 Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
025:002 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
025:003 Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan.  The sons
        of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
025:004 The sons of Midian:  Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.
        All these were the children of Keturah.
025:005 Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,
025:006 but to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts.
        He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
        eastward, to the east country.
025:007 These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived:
        one hundred seventy-five years.
025:008 Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age,
        an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
025:009 Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
        in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite,
        which is before Mamre,
025:010 the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth.
        Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.
025:011 It happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac,
        his son.  Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.
025:012 Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,
        whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.
025:013 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
        according to the order of their birth:  the firstborn
        of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
025:014 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
025:015 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names,
        by their villages, and by their encampments:  twelve princes,
        according to their nations.
025:017 These are the years of the life of Ishmael:  one hundred
        thirty-seven years.  He gave up the spirit and died,
        and was gathered to his people.
025:018 They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you
        go toward Assyria.  He lived opposite all his relatives.
025:019 This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son.
        Abraham became the father of Isaac.
025:020 Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter
        of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban
        the Syrian, to be his wife.
025:021 Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren.
        Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
025:022 The children struggled together within her.  She said,
        "If it be so, why do I live?"  She went to inquire of Yahweh.
025:023 Yahweh said to her, Two nations are in your womb.
        Two peoples will be separated from your body.
        The one people will be stronger than the other people.
        The elder will serve the younger.
025:024 When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were
        twins in her womb.
025:025 The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment.
        They named him Esau.
025:026 After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on
        Esau's heel.  He was named Jacob.  Isaac was sixty years old
        when she bore them.
025:027 The boys grew.  Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field.
        Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.
025:028 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison.
        Rebekah loved Jacob.
025:029 Jacob boiled stew.  Esau came in from the field,
        and he was famished.
025:030 Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew,
        for I am famished."  Therefore his name was called Edom.
025:031 Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."
025:032 Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die.  What good is the
        birthright to me?"
025:033 Jacob said, "Swear to me first."  He swore to him.
        He sold his birthright to Jacob.
025:034 Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils.  He ate and drank,
        rose up, and went his way.  So Esau despised his birthright.
026:001 There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine
        that was in the days of Abraham.  Isaac went to Abimelech
        king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
026:002 Yahweh appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt.
        Live in the land I will tell you about.
026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you.
        For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I
        will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.
026:004 I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will
        give to your seed all these lands.  In your seed will all
        the nations of the earth be blessed,
026:005 because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge,
        my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
026:006 Isaac lived in Gerar.
026:007 The men of the place asked him about his wife.  He said,
        "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife,"
        lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah,
        because she is beautiful to look at."
026:008 It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech
        king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,
        and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.
026:009 Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife.
        Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'"  Isaac said to him,
        "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'"
026:010 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us?
        One of the people might easily have lain with your wife,
        and you would have brought guilt on us!"
026:011 Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this
        man or his wife will surely be put to death."
026:012 Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one
        hundred times what he planted.  Yahweh blessed him.
026:013 The man grew great, and grew more and more until he
        became very great.
026:014 He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds,
        and a great household.  The Philistines envied him.
026:015 Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in
        the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped,
        and filled with earth.
026:016 Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much
        mightier than we."
026:017 Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar,
        and lived there.
026:018 Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days
        of Abraham his father.  For the Philistines had stopped them
        after the death of Abraham.  He called their names after
        the names by which his father had called them.
026:019 Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well
        of springing water.
026:020 The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying,
        "The water is ours."  He called the name of the well Esek,
        because they contended with him.
026:021 They dug another well, and they argued over that, also.
        He called the name of it Sitnah.
026:022 He left that place, and dug another well.  They didn't
        argue over that one.  He called it Rehoboth.  He said,
        "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful
        in the land."
026:023 He went up from there to Beersheba.
026:024 Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am
        the God of Abraham your father.  Don't be afraid, for I am
        with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my
        servant Abraham's sake."
026:025 He built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh,
        and pitched his tent there.  There Isaac's servants dug a well.
026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend,
        and Phicol the captain of his army.
026:027 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me,
        and have sent me away from you?"
026:028 They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you.
        We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us
        and you, and let us make a covenant with you,
026:029 that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you,
        and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent
        you away in peace.'  You are now the blessed of Yahweh."
026:030 He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
026:031 They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another.
        Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
026:032 It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told
        him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him,
        "We have found water."
026:033 He called it Shibah.{Shibah means "oath" or "seven."} Therefore
        the name of the city is Beersheba{Beersheba means "well of the oath"
        or "well of the seven"} to this day.
026:034 When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith,
        the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter
        of Elon the Hittite.
026:035 They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.
027:001 It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,
        so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son,
        and said to him, "My son?"  He said to him, "Here I am."
027:002 He said, "See now, I am old.  I don't know the day of my death.
027:003 Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow,
        and go out to the field, and take me venison.
027:004 Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me,
        that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."
027:005 Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son.
        Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
027:006 Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard
        your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,
027:007 'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat,
        and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'
027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which
        I command you.
027:009 Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids
        of the goats.  I will make them savory food for your father,
        such as he loves.
027:010 You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that
        he may bless you before his death."
027:011 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother
        is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
027:012 What if my father touches me?  I will seem to him as a deceiver,
        and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."
027:013 His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son.
        Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."
027:014 He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother.
        His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
027:015 Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son,
        which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob,
        her younger son.
027:016 She put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands,
        and on the smooth of his neck.
027:017 She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared,
        into the hand of her son Jacob.
027:018 He came to his father, and said, "My father?"  He said, "Here I am.
        Who are you, my son?"
027:019 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn.
        I have done what you asked me to do.  Please arise, sit and eat
        of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
027:020 Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly,
        my son?"  He said, "Because Yahweh your God gave me success."
027:021 Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you,
        my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."
027:022 Jacob went near to Isaac his father.  He felt him, and said,
        "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
027:023 He didn't recognize him, because his hands were hairy,
        like his brother, Esau's hands.  So he blessed him.
027:024 He said, "Are you really my son Esau?"  He said, "I am."
027:025 He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison,
        that my soul may bless you."  He brought it near to him, and he ate.
        He brought him wine, and he drank.
027:026 His father Isaac said to him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
027:027 He came near, and kissed him.  He smelled the smell of his clothing,
        and blessed him, and said, "Behold, the smell of my son
        is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.
027:028 God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth,
        and plenty of grain and new wine.
027:029 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you.
        Be lord over your brothers.  Let your mother's sons
        bow down to you.  Cursed be everyone who curses you.
        Blessed be everyone who blesses you."
027:030 It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob,
        and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father,
        that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
027:031 He also made savory food, and brought it to his father.
        He said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his
        son's venison, that your soul may bless me."
027:032 Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?"  He said,
        "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
027:033 Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who, then, is he who has
        taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before
        you came, and have blessed him?  Yes, he will be blessed."
027:034 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an
        exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father,
        "Bless me, even me also, my father."
027:035 He said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken
        away your blessing."
027:036 He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob?  For he has
        supplanted me these two times.  He took away my birthright.
        See, now he has taken away my blessing."  He said, "Haven't you
        reserved a blessing for me?"
027:037 Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord,
        and all his brothers have I given to him for servants.
        With grain and new wine have I sustained him.  What then
        will I do for you, my son?"
027:038 Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father?
        Bless me, even me also, my father."  Esau lifted up
        his voice, and wept.
027:039 Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth
        will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.
027:040 By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother.
        It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall
        shake his yoke from off your neck."
027:041 Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father
        blessed him.  Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning
        for my father are at hand.  Then I will kill my brother Jacob."
027:042 The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah.
        She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said
        to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you
        by planning to kill you.
027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice.  Arise, flee to Laban,
        my brother, in Haran.
027:044 Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away;
027:045 until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what
        you have done to him.  Then I will send, and get you from there.
        Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
027:046 Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of
        the daughters of Heth.  If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters
        of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land,
        what good will my life do me?"
028:001 Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, "You shall
        not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
028:002 Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your
        mother's father.  Take a wife from there from the daughters
        of Laban, your mother's brother.
028:003 May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you,
        that you may be a company of peoples,
028:004 and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed
        with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel,
        which God gave to Abraham."
028:005 Isaac sent Jacob away.  He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of
        Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
028:006 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away
        to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as
        he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, "You shall not
        take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,"
028:007 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
        to Paddan Aram.
028:008 Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac,
        his father.
028:009 Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had,
        Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister
        of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
028:010 Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
028:011 He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night,
        because the sun had set.  He took one of the stones of the place,
        and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
028:012 He dreamed.  Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and the top
        of it reached to heaven.  Behold, the angels of God ascending
        and descending on it.
028:013 Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, "I am Yahweh,
        the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac.
        The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.
028:014 Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread
        abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
        and to the south.  In you and in your seed will all the families
        of the earth be blessed.
028:015 Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go,
        and will bring you again into this land.  For I will not leave you,
        until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."
028:016 Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely Yahweh
        is in this place, and I didn't know it."
028:017 He was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place!
        This is none other than God's house, and this is the
        gate of heaven."
028:018 Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
        that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar,
        and poured oil on the top of it.
028:019 He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city
        was Luz at the first.
028:020 Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will
        keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat,
        and clothing to put on,
028:021 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Yahweh
        will be my God,
028:022 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be
        God's house.  Of all that you will give me I will surely give
        the tenth to you."
029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of
        the children of the east.
029:002 He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks
        of sheep lying there by it.  For out of that well they watered
        the flocks.  The stone on the well's mouth was large.
029:003 There all the flocks were gathered.  They rolled the stone
        from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone
        again on the well's mouth in its place.
029:004 Jacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?"
        They said, "We are from Haran."
029:005 He said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?"  They said,
        "We know him."
029:006 He said to them, "Is it well with him?"  They said, "It is well.
        See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."
029:007 He said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day,
        not time to gather the livestock together.  Water the sheep,
        and go and feed them."
029:008 They said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered
        together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth.
        Then we water the sheep."
029:009 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her
        father's sheep, for she kept them.
029:010 It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban,
        his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother,
        that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth,
        and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
029:011 Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
029:012 Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that
        he was Rebekah's son.  She ran and told her father.
029:013 It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son,
        that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him,
        and brought him to his house.  Jacob told Laban all these things.
029:014 Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh.
        He lived with him for a month.
029:015 Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you
        therefore serve me for nothing?  Tell me, what will
        your wages be?"
029:016 Laban had two daughters.  The name of the elder was Leah,
        and the name of the younger was Rachel.
029:017 Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in
        form and attractive.
029:018 Jacob loved Rachel.  He said, "I will serve you seven years
        for Rachel, your younger daughter."
029:019 Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I
        should give her to another man.  Stay with me."
029:020 Jacob served seven years for Rachel.  They seemed to him
        but a few days, for the love he had for her.
029:021 Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled,
        that I may go in to her."
029:022 Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
029:023 It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
        and brought her to him.  He went in to her.
029:024 Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
029:025 It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah.
        He said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me?
        Didn't I serve with you for Rachel?  Why then have
        you deceived me?"
029:026 Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger
        before the firstborn.
029:027 Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other
        also for the service which you will serve with me yet
        seven other years."
029:028 Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week.  He gave him Rachel
        his daughter as wife.
029:029 Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid,
        to be her handmaid.
029:030 He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,
        and served with him yet seven other years.
029:031 Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb,
        but Rachel was barren.
029:032 Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben.
        For she said, "Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction.
        For now my husband will love me."
029:033 She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, "Because Yahweh has
        heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also."
        She named him Simeon.
029:034 She conceived again, and bore a son.  Said, "Now this time will my
        husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons."
        Therefore was his name called Levi.
029:035 She conceived again, and bore a son.  She said, "This time
        will I praise Yahweh."  Therefore she named him Judah.
        Then she stopped bearing.
030:001 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied
        her sister.  She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else
        I will die."
030:002 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said,
        "Am I in the
        land of Canaan.
037:002 This is the history of the generations of Jacob.  Joseph, being
        seventeen years old, was feeding the flock we of human nature, where every
heart may find some corresponding harmony? When, therefore, it is said,
that thebjects of biographical notice; while all
that has been collected among his own countrymen, is a scanty memoir in
a common dictionary. That we are doomed to remain ignorant of the life
of such men, speaks a loud disgrace.--I lament it.

    “Manners aim to facilitate life, to get rid of
    impediments.”


DINNERS.[B]

A “dinner” is supposed to be an elaborate affair, with numerous courses
and ample service, and is usually given at seven or eight o’clock
in the evening. At a dinner the number of courses naturally varies
according to the taste and financial condition of the hostess. (For
arrangement of the table, see Chapter VI.)

For a formal dinner the courses usually consist of soup, fish, a roast
with one or more vegetables, a salad, an ice or ice cream, cakes,
bonbons, and black coffee. Olives and salted almonds, jellies, etc.,
generally appear in some of the courses.

Although the following really belongs under the head of “The Table” and
“Service at Table,” a repetition here may not come amiss.

The attendant places each dish, in succession, before the host or
hostess with the pile of plates. Each plate is supplied, taken by the
attendant on a small salver, and set, from the left, before the guest.
A second dish which belongs to the course is presented at the left of
the guest, who helps himself. As a rule the woman at the right of the
host, or the eldest woman, should be served first. As soon as a course
is finished, the plates are promptly removed, and the next course is
served in the same way. Before the dessert is brought on, all crumbs
should be brushed from the cloth. The finger bowls, which are brought
in on a napkin on a dessert-plate and set at the left of the plate, are
used by dipping the fingers in lightly and drying them on the napkin.
They should be half full of warm water with a bit of lemon floating in
it. When all have finished dessert, the hostess gives the signal, by
pushing back her chair, that dinner is ended, and the guests repair to
the drawing-room, the oldest leading and the youngest following last,
the men passing into the library or smoking-room.

Seemingly, one should arrive at the house where one is invited to a
dinner or a luncheon at exactly the hour mentioned in the invitation;
but the proper thing at a formal function is to get to the house
ten minutes after the hour of the meal, and to be announced in the
drawing-room five minutes later.

The host, with the guest of honor, leads the way into the dining-room
at a dinner; at a luncheon the hostess leads the way alone or with one
of the guests.

Fifteen minutes is the longest time required to wait for a tardy guest
when the dinner hour was understood, as it always should be.

If the hostess thinks the visitor has no acquaintances in the room,
she introduces her to two or three persons who are near her, and then,
counting on her knowledge of the customs of society, she will feel
quite sure that her guest will enjoy herself.

A hostess should never reprove a servant before a guest, as it is
unpleasant for all concerned, and by passing over the annoyance
herself, it may escape the attention of others.

No accident must seem to disturb a hostess, no disappointment embarrass
her.

At formal dinner parties the servant who is detailed to attend
to the wants of the men guests hands each one, as he leaves the
dressing-room, an envelope containing a card bearing the name of the
woman whom he is to take to dinner.


LUNCHEONS.

Luncheons are usually given between the hours of one and two o’clock in
the afternoon, and to them women only are invited. The menu is lighter
than for a dinner, and generally consists of sherbets, oyster patties,
scalloped oysters, sweet-breads, sandwiches, salads, ices, cheese
sticks, fruit, ice cream, cakes, bonbons, salted almonds, olives, and
black coffee, served in such number and order of courses as best suits
the hostess.


BREAKFASTS.

The difference between a breakfast and a luncheon is very slight. On
the invitation the word breakfast is used instead of luncheon, and
the hour is earlier than for a luncheon. Also men and woman may meet
together for a breakfast, and therefore a few more solid courses
are advisable. Otherwise one may be guided entirely in giving the
entertainment by the rules which apply to a luncheon.


TEAS.

A tea is the simplest and easiest kind of an entertainment to give, for
the only essential requisites for its success are prettily arranged
receiving-rooms, with as many flowers as one can afford; a gracious
hostess, who stands during the hours of the function to receive her
guests and is properly dressed in a becoming high-necked house dress;
a few other women, who also receive in pretty dresses; and a dainty
tea table, which may be presided over by a woman friend or two of the
hostess. It is only necessary to serve a modest menu of tea, chocolate
or bouillon, assorted sandwiches, fancy cakes, and bonbons. The other
factors to the tea’s success are pleasant weather and well trained
servants, who may assist in serving the tea and are alert to open and
close the door for the guests.

At a formal function of any kind the guests leave their wraps in
dressing-rooms, where one or more maids should be on hand to assist
women in their dressing-room, and a man to perform the same services
in the men’s dressing-room; but at a small tea, where, as a rule, the
guests do not remove their street wraps, it is only necessary to have a
maid in the entrance hall to be ready, if called on, to do any service.

It is not customary to offer refreshments to casual evening callers;
but if one has a regular evening for receiving, she may have a tea
table in the drawing-room, and serve tea, chocolate, sandwiches, cake,
etc., as in entertaining on the afternoon of a “day.”


RECEPTIONS.

On the day of the reception, the hostess, with her assistants, should
receive the guests, standing at the door of the drawing-room. The
refreshment tables should be spread in the dining-room, and prettily
decorated with flowers, candles in candelabra or candlesticks, dishes
of bonbons and cakes, plates of sandwiches, and platters of salad. A
bouillon urn may stand at one end of the table with cups, and coffee
may be served from the other end. All that is necessary for the menu
is bouillon, easily prepared in the house from canned bouillon,
jellied tongue, chicken salad, and sandwiches, ices and cake, fruit,
and candies. Coffee and lemonade will suffice for beverages. If one
can afford to have a few pieces of music, so much the better. The
musicians should play from some hidden nook. One or two servants in the
dining-room, and one to open and shut the front door, will be all that
is necessary.


DANCING PARTIES.

For the form of invitation refer to Chapter II.

In selecting a company for a dancing party the hostess will naturally
choose only those who dance, and she should see, as far as possible,
that all the women are provided with partners.

It is better to dance first with one acquaintance and then with
another, rather than to make one’s self conspicuous by giving a great
number of dances to one man.

A man gives the first and last dances to his partner of the evening.

No man should invite a young woman to attend a dress affair without
providing a carriage for her. When the party is small and informal, it
is allowable to go on the street-cars.

At the end of the dance, the man should offer his arm to his partner,
and take at least one turn around the room before consigning her to her
seat.

A man who can dance, and will not, ought to remain away from a ball.

If for any reason a girl should refuse to dance with one man, she
should not accept another invitation for the same dance.

An invitation to a ball may be asked for a friend who is a stranger in
town, and has had no opportunity of making the acquaintance of the one
who gives the ball.

A man should not ask a girl, to whom he has been introduced for the
purpose of dancing with her, for more than two dances the same evening.


CARD PARTIES.

If given, prizes should be carefully chosen, so that they may be in
good taste and desirable. The supper should be served at the card
tables after the playing is over. A large napkin should be spread on
the top of each table, and the refreshments served in courses.


WEDDINGS.

For invitation forms see Chapter II.

When a wedding takes place in a church that has but one entrance, the
customary way for the bridal procession to enter is for the groom and
best man to walk in just behind the minister, a little before the
others, and to take their places at the altar; then the ushers enter,
walking two by two; then the bridesmaids in the same order; then the
maid of honor alone; and last the bride on her father’s arm. The
bride’s family enter the church a few minutes before the minister and
the groom and bridal party.

A bride goes up to the altar with her veil over her face, but comes
down with it thrown back. It is the duty of the maid of honor to throw
it back immediately after the ceremony is ended.

When the bride’s mother gives her away at a church ceremony, she
usually walks up the aisle with the bride. After she has given her to
the groom, she steps quietly and unescorted to the front pew, where she
stays during the remainder of the service. The bride may walk up the
aisle with an attendant instead of with her mother, who in this case
steps from her seat in the front pew to the chancel when the time comes
for her to officiate, and steps back to her seat afterwards.

The bride and the groom should stand at the wedding reception until
they have received the congratulations of all present, then, together,
they should walk into the room where the breakfast is to be served. The
others follow as they please, with the exception of the parents on both
sides. The groom’s father usually escorts the bride’s mother, and _vice
versa_.

It is not the custom for a bride to remove her gloves at the wedding.
The inside seam of the ring finger of the glove should be ripped
beforehand; and when the time comes for the ring to be put on, the
bride merely slips off this glove finger, and puts it back again after
the ring is on her finger.

At no wedding service is it proper for the bride to enter the church
alone.

At a church or house wedding where the bride walks up the aisle with
her sister acting as the maid of honor, instead of with a gentleman
escort, she need not take the arm of her attendant, as both the ladies
will look more graceful if walking separately. The maid of honor should
carry a bouquet, and the bride a bouquet, prayer-book, or bible.

At a home wedding the bride enters the room on the arm of her father.
With a short dress she would not wear a veil.

The wearing of gloves at an informal wedding is entirely a matter of
taste. Recently at several large weddings they were omitted by the
entire bridal party.

The prettiest way to make an aisle for the bridal party at a house
wedding is for four children to enter the room where the ceremony will
be, just before the bridal party comes in, and separate the guests
into two groups by stretching two pieces of white ribbon the length
of the room. A child stands at each end of the two pieces of ribbon,
holding it while the bridal party walks up between them, and during the
service. Ushers may hold the ribbons instead of the children, or the
ends may be fastened around plants which are placed at the requisite
points.

Where there is no side door through which the groom and best man may
enter the room at a house wedding, they come in by the principal door
just before the bridal party and just after the minister.

It is not customary for the men at a wedding party to kiss the bride;
that is a liberty taken only by the immediate members of the family.

A bride, if she wishes, may omit the bridal veil, but she should then
wear a dainty bonnet or picture hat. The ushers and best men are
invited by the bridegroom.

If the church wedding is a full dress one, followed by an evening
reception, it is proper to wear an evening gown. If it is in the
daytime, a handsome visiting dress and pretty bonnet are proper.

At a daytime wedding the guests seldom remove their bonnets, although,
of course, heavy wraps are frequently laid aside. At an evening affair
one goes in full dress without anything on one’s head. The ushers
present the guests to the bridal party. The bridesmaids are spoken to
by the people they know, but it is not necessary that they should be
addressed by everybody.

A bride may wear her wedding dress after her wedding day as much
or as little as she chooses. For the sake of sentiment many brides
like to preserve their wedding dresses intact to hand down to future
generations; but a girl who has to consider economy cannot afford to
consider sentiment, and often the wedding dress is converted into a
low dinner and evening gown soon after the wedding day. A bride may,
with perfect propriety, wear her wedding dress to the reception given
her after her wedding by the groom’s mother. Of course, she will wear
it just as it was when she was married, high in the neck, unless the
reception takes place in the evening and demands evening dress, when,
according to the conventions, it must be cut low.

A bridegroom is always expected to furnish the bouquets that the bride,
bridesmaids, and all the bride’s attendants carry at the wedding. He
should learn from the bride the flowers she wishes, and should order
them several days before the wedding, so that they may be ready at the
bride’s house when the bridesmaids meet there to go together to the
church or to the place where the ceremony is held.

Besides furnishing these bouquets, the groom provides the ushers and
best men with their _boutonnières_, and gives them also some small
souvenir, and, if he wishes, a bachelor dinner or supper a day or two
before the wedding.

There are no wedding luncheons nowadays. Every entertainment of the
kind up to two o’clock is called a breakfast, and when it takes place
in the afternoon or evening it is called a reception.


WEDDING GIFTS.

The idea that a wedding invitation necessitates a present has,
sensibly enough, gone out of fashion, and only those who are bound by
ties of blood or close friendship have the privilege of sending a gift
to the bride.

Presents should be sent as soon after receiving the invitations as
possible. All wedding gifts, even from friends of the groom who may
never have met the bride, are sent to the bride; and, if marked, they
should be engraved with the initials or monogram of the bride’s maiden
name, or they may have her name in full.

Wedding presents should be acknowledged by the bride-elect in a short
personal note, which should be written and sent immediately on receipt
of the present.

When several friends combine in giving a present to the bride, she
should write a letter of thanks to each one separately, sending the
letters by post.

It is perfectly proper to open a gift in the presence of the giver, and
express one’s pleasure and gratitude on the spot. Indeed, it is much
better form to do so than to wait until the giver has gone.


WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.

The paper wedding, so termed, is celebrated one year after marriage.
Invitations should be issued on heavy gray paper or thin card-board.
Presents may consist of any article made of paper or _papier mâché_;
such, for instance, as books, engravings, etc.

The wooden wedding is celebrated five years after marriage. Invitations
may be issued upon wooden cards, or wooden cards may be inclosed with
an invitation written or engraved upon a sheet of wedding note paper.
The presents may be anything made of wood, from a mustard spoon to a
house or set of furniture.

The tin wedding comes ten years after marriage. Invitation cards are
sometimes covered with tin foil, or tin cards are inclosed, or, if
preferred, the invitation is printed on tin bronze paper. Presents
should consist of articles made of tin.

The crystal wedding, fifteen years after marriage, is next in order.
Cards may be issued upon transparent paper, or upon note paper with a
card of isinglass inclosed.

The china wedding takes place twenty years after marriage.
Semi-transparent cardboard will answer for the invitations.

The silver wedding is celebrated on the twenty-fifth anniversary,
and is generally an occasion of much more importance than any of the
foregoing anniversaries. The invitations may be printed on silver
paper, and the presents are, of course, articles of silver.

The golden wedding, celebrated on the fiftieth anniversary of the
marriage, may be said to be the one in which the young do homage to
the old. It should be conducted by the near relatives or friends of
the couple, and the occasion should be made one of retrospect, of
encouragement, and of congratulation. The invitations should be on
white paper in gold letters, and the presents should be of gold.

At each of these anniversaries it is customary to have the marriage
ceremony re-performed, and all arrangements for the celebration are
made in about the same manner as for the first marriage.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote B: In looking up any one point in this book,—as “dinners,”
for instance,—one will be obliged sometimes to refer to more than one
place. Chapter II., under “Notes of Invitation,” and Chapter I., under
its three different heads, contain more or less information concerning
“dinners,” which it seems difficult to classify anymore closely than
has been done.]




CHAPTER IV.

CONVERSATION, CHAPERONAGE, MARRIAGE, DOMESTIC ETIQUETTE AND DUTIES.

    “Manners are not idle, but are the fruit of noble
    natures and of loyal minds.”


CONVERSATION.

The late Dr. George Ripley was wont to say that the secret of being
agreeable in conversation was to be honorable to the ideas of others.
He affirmed that some people only half listened to you, because they
were considering, even while you spoke, with what fine words, what
wealth of wit, they should reply, and they began to speak almost before
your sentence had died upon your lips. These people, he said, might
be brilliant, witty, dazzling, but never could they be agreeable. You
do not love to talk to them. You feel that they are impatient for
their turn to come, and that they have no hospitality towards your
thoughts—none of that gentle friendliness which asks your idea and
makes much of it. This want of hospitality to other people’s ideas
often has its root in egotism, but it is equally apt to be the growth
of a secret want of self-confidence, a fear that one will not be ready
to take one’s own part well,—an uneasy self-consciousness which makes
real sympathetic attention to the ideas of others impossible.

Agreeability, readiness in conversation, tact and graciousness of
manner are great aids to popularity. To possess these qualities one
must have marked consideration for others, and be ever ready to
manifest it. One should also be ready to recall faces and names.

Though one has but few facts and ideas to draw upon, she may still,
by making sufficient effort, become a fair conversationalist. If one
despair in this direction, she may at least train herself to become an
interesting listener, and she will be surprised to find how popular she
will be; for three-quarters of the world like to talk, while to listen
intelligently is a great talent. The good listener, by her evident
interest in, and sympathetic attention to, the matter of conversation,
brings out all that is best in the one with whom she talks. Diffident
people forget their shyness in her presence, and leave her with the
comfortable and novel conviction that they have, after all, acquitted
themselves rather well.

No well-bred person would be guilty of the gross rudeness of picking
up a book or magazine and “looking through” it while pretending to
pay heed to the talk of a friend. The assurance, “I am only looking at
the pictures of this magazine, not reading, and I hear every word you
say,” is no palliation of the offence. The speaker would be justified
in refusing to continue the conversation until the pictures had been
properly studied. If a speech is worth hearing, it is worthy of
respectful and earnest attention.

No one should ever monopolize the conversation, unless he wishes to win
for himself the name of a bore.

A well-educated and finely cultured person proclaims himself by the
simplicity and terseness of his language.

In conversation all provincialisms, affectations of foreign accents,
mannerisms, exaggerations, and slang are detestable.

Flippancy is as much an evidence of ill-breeding as is the perpetual
smile, the wandering eye, the vacant stare, or the half-open mouth of
the man who is preparing to break in upon the conversation.

Interruption of the speech of others is a great sin against good
breeding.

Anecdotes should be sparsely introduced into a conversation, lest they
become stale. Repartee must be indulged in with moderation. Puns are
considered vulgar by many.

In addressing persons with titles, one ought always to add the name;
as, “What do you think, Doctor Graves?” not, “What do you think,
Doctor?”

The great secret of talking well is to adapt one’s conversation
skillfully to the hearers.

In a _tête-à-tête_ conversation, it is extremely ill-bred to drop the
voice to a whisper, or to converse on private matters.

One should never try to hide the lips in talking by putting up the hand
or a fan.

One should avoid long conversations in society with members of his own
family.

If an unfinished conversation is continued after the entrance of a
visitor, its import should be explained to him.

Though bores find their account in speaking ill or well of themselves,
it is the characteristic of a gentleman that he never speaks of himself
at all. La Buryere says: “The great charm of conversation consists less
in the display of one’s own wit and intelligence than in the power to
draw forth the resources of others; he who leaves one after a long
conversation, pleased with himself and the part _he_ has taken in the
discourse, will be the other’s warmest admirer.”

In society the absent-minded man is uncivil.

There are many persons who commence speaking before they know what
they are going to say. The ill-natured world, which never misses an
opportunity of being severe, declares them to be foolish and destitute
of brains.

He who knows the world, will not be too bashful; he who knows himself,
will not be imprudent.

There is no surer sign of vulgarity than the perpetual boasting of fine
things at home.

One should be careful how freely he offers advice.

If one keeps silent sometimes upon subjects of which he is known to be
a judge, his silence, when from ignorance, will not discover him.

One should not argue a point when it is possible to avoid it, but when
he does argue, he should do so in a gentlemanly and dispassionate
manner.

One should never notice any mistakes in the language of others.


CHAPERONAGE.

The foreign custom that makes a chaperone indispensable where young
people are gathered together at places of public entertainment, has
long obtained in the cities of the East, and in all conventional
communities everywhere. No really fashionable party is made up without
a chaperone.

A young woman condemns herself in the eyes of good society who is
observed to enter alone with a young man a place of public refreshment,
be the restaurant or tea room ever so select. Bred under other
conditions of a society so necessarily varying as that in our broad
America, a stranger visiting New York, for instance, might readily and
innocently make a mistake of this nature, and blush at finding herself
condemned for it. In the same category of offenses is ranked that of
maidens visiting places of public amusement under the escort of young
men alone. Many parts of the South and West allow this to be done
with the smiling consent of good society; but in Eastern cities it is
considered a violation of good form, and for the comfort, if not the
convenience, of the girl considering it, had better be ranked among the
lost privileges upon which social evolution may look back with fond
regret.

It is always wisest, when a number of young people are to have a
party, to ask two or three married women to be present, not only for
propriety’s sake, but because there will then be no danger of anything
unwished for happening, inasmuch as it is the duty of the chaperones to
make all social entertainments smooth and pleasant.

When it is necessary for a girl to pay long visits to a dentist’s
office, she should be accompanied either by her mother, or some woman
relative, or maid.

The etiquette of chaperonage is much less strict for a young widow than
for an unmarried girl of the same age; but it is important and in good
taste for a woman who is a widow to be very quiet and inconspicuous in
all she does, giving by her behavior no opportunity for criticism.


MARRIAGE.

A young girl’s own safety, as regards her present and future happiness,
demands that she receive attentions from only the best of young
men,—those of whom her reason would approve, if the acquaintance should
lead to more than acquaintance.

Parents should carefully watch the young men who frequent their houses,
in order to see that undesirable intimacies are not formed with their
daughters, for friendships and intimacies soon lead to love.

Many a girl, feeling convinced that she had loved unwisely, has entered
upon the married state with heart and reason at variance, when she
might have given up the acquaintance, in the beginning of it, very
easily.

The most perfect reserve in courtship, even in cases of the most ardent
attachment, is indispensable to the confidence and trust of married
life to come.

All public display of devotion should be avoided, for it tends to
lessen mutual respect, and it makes the actors ridiculous in the eyes
or others. It is quite possible for a man to show every conceivable
attention to the one to whom he is engaged, and yet to avoid committing
the slightest offence against delicacy or good taste.

It is quite possible for a man to show attention, and even assiduity
up to a certain point, without becoming a lover; and it is equally
possible for the girl to let it be seen that he is not disagreeable to
her, without actually encouraging him. No man likes to be refused, and
no man of tact will risk a refusal.

Long engagements are usually entered into by people who are quite
young, but who, for some reason, cannot marry. As the years go on their
tastes may change, and yet each may feel that honor binds the one to
the other. The woman chosen by a man when he is twenty-one is seldom
the woman he would chose when he is forty. When people marry young
they grow accustomed to each other, and, oddly enough, they grow to be
alike; but during a long engagement their tastes are apt to change, and
the result is apt to be anything but a happy one. Of course, there are
exceptions, but, generalizing, the long engagement is to be feared.


DOMESTIC ETIQUETTE AND DUTIES.

Etiquette is a comprehensive term, and its observances are nowhere more
to be desired than in the domestic circle.

If husbands and wives, generally, would render each other half of the
little attentions they lavished upon each other before marriage, their
mutual happiness would be more than doubled.

A wife should never let her husband have cause to complain that she is
more agreeable abroad than at home, nor see her negligent of dress and
manners at home when it is the reverse in company.

If, unhappily, any misunderstandings or annoyances occur between
husband and wife, it is ill-bred and unjust for either to repeat them
to a third person.

Faithful unto death in all things should be the motto of both husband
and wife; and forbearance with each other’s peculiarities, their
never-ending effort to attain.

If a girl discovers very soon after her marriage that she has made
a mistake, it is wisest for her to make the best of it; she should
look for all that is good in her husband and try to forget that which
she dislikes. There are times when a legal separation is necessary,
but when people marry they marry for better or for worse, and if,
unfortunately, it should be for worse, even that does not release them
from the solemn vows which they have taken.

It is not in good taste for a husband and wife to call each other by
endearing names in the presence of others.

A man has no right whatever to open his wife’s mail, but a woman should
not receive any letters that she would not be willing that her husband
should see.

CHAPTER V.

DRESS, GLOVES, STREET ETIQUETTE, TRAVELING, BICYCLING, TELEPHONING.

    “Refinement of character is said never to be found with
    vulgarity of dress.”


DRESS.

In appropriateness our people have something to learn, as has the
whole world, for that matter. Necklaces and jewels in the morning are
monstrous, no matter what the fashion of the moment may be, and there
will come a time when every one will look upon them with horror, as
every one, indeed, used to do.

The day is past when latitude or great variety in dress is considered
original. Clothes, if they are startling at all, must be startling in
a degree to be borne. A train cannot be worn where only a short skirt
is in order, nor can an abbreviated drapery go where full dress is
required. A garden party, for instance, or an out-of-door tea at a
private house demands a muslin, a silk, or, at any rate, an elaborate
toilet, while at a golf club, such dress is absurd, except for the
elderly or non-players. In winter, frills and furbelows, if they are
worn at all, are worn at large teas, the plain tailor-made suit having
gone out for such purposes. However, it is difficult to follow the
vagaries of fashion in these regards.

For morning wear, no dress can be too simple. Luncheons are growing
more and more informal. When distances are great, however, and one
dresses for calls in the part of town where the luncheon is, afterward,
more elaborateness of dress is allowed.

The best advice to all girls upon the subject must be, not to be
overdressed, nor yet to be careless in the matter. They should attire
themselves according to their circumstances, and should, above all
things, avoid all extremes of fashion, as well as all eccentricities of
style.

Only quiet colors should be worn either to church or on the street,
and wherever girls go they should endeavor to be unconscious of their
personal appearance.

The woman who is overdressed at an afternoon reception is much more
uncomfortable than she who is gowned with the simplicity of a Quaker. A
well fitting wool gown, a becoming bonnet, a fresh pair of gloves, and
one is suitably dressed as a caller.

A girl of fourteen should not wear her hair done up, and her gown
should come just below her ankles.

It is not in good taste for a young girl to wear diamond rings; if she
is fortunate enough to possess them, let her keep them carefully until
she is older, and then she may wear them with perfect propriety.

It is in very bad taste to wear a dressing-sacque when breakfasting
in a public dining-room of a hotel. Such an undress costume is only
permissible in one’s own room.

A frock coat is, under no circumstances, a correct garment for a man
to wear at an evening dance, neither is a Tuxedo or dinner coat. The
proper dress is a full dress suit, with white vest and white string
tie. Possibly a dinner coat might be allowable at a very small and very
informal dance, but a frock coat never.

A man should wear a white tie with a dress suit at any large formal
entertainment, such as a ball, the opera, a wedding reception, a
large dinner party, etc., and on all occasions where he wears a white
waistcoat. He should wear a black tie at the theater, at a small
dinner, in calling, and at home with his dinner coat.

Evening dress may be as gay as one chooses to make it, though extremes
are not desirable.

Dresses made a suitable length for walking are much more appropriate
for the street than those that are so long that their wearers become
street cleaners.

Neatness in a lady’s dress is one of the first requisites.

To dress well requires good taste, good sense, and refinement.

The most appropriate and becoming dress is that which so harmonizes
with the figure that the apparel is unobserved.

A hostess should be careful not to out-dress her guests.

When going out one should consider the sort of company she is likely to
meet, and should dress accordingly.

The idea that “dress makes the man” is a very false one, but a man
_does_ make, or select, rather, his dress, and is judged somewhat in
accordance with that selection.

At a five o’clock church wedding the groom, best man, and ushers all
dress as nearly as possible alike. The proper costume or suit is a
black frock coat, gray trousers, black or fancy vesting waist coat,
white tie, _glacé_ gloves, patent leather boots, and a tall hat.


GLOVES.

A young woman should of course wear gloves with a full evening dress to
any kind of an evening entertainment.

On taking one’s seat at a dinner table or a card table one may remove
one’s gloves, but not until then; and at the theater or opera, gloves
should be worn throughout the performance and during the evening.

A man wears light or white kid gloves to the opera, dances, a
reception, or any other formal evening entertainment, except a dinner.

It is usual to remove one’s gloves when eating supper at an evening
affair, unless merely a cup of bouillon or an ice may be chosen, and
then there would be no impropriety in keeping on one’s gloves.

A man wears gloves when calling, and removes them just before or just
after entering the parlor. Tan gloves may be worn at all hours of the
day; white or pearl ones are proper in the evening, when calling, or at
any place of amusement.

No matter how long one’s gloves are, they should be entirely taken off
at supper, and be resumed again upon returning to the drawing-room or
after using the finger bowls, and before arising from the feast.

To wear gloves while playing cards is an affectation of elegance.


STREET ETIQUETTE.

A man offers his right arm, if either, to a woman on the street (also
in the house), that she may have her right hand free for holding her
parasol or guiding her train. Both common sense and gallantry assign
the woman’s place where it is for her greatest convenience, and that
is, undeniably, on the right of the man.

The rule for giving the left arm was held good in those days when it
was necessary for men to pass to the left, thus keeping the sword-arm
free for self-protection or for the protection of the women, but now
the passing is all to the right.

In walking with a woman a man chooses the outer side without any regard
as to its being either the right or the left. In walking with two women
he chooses the outer side also, and never walks between them.

A man walking with a woman returns a bow made to her, lifting his hat,
although the one bowing is a stranger to him.

Ladies do not talk or call across the street.

Men should not smoke when driving or walking with women, nor on
promenades much frequented, where they cannot remove the cigar from the
mouth whenever meeting a woman.

One should never stare at another.

A man when meeting a woman who is walking and with whom he wishes to
converse, does not allow her to stand while talking, but turns and
walks with her.

A man cannot refuse to return the bow of any respectable woman. If he
does not wish to recognize her he must avoid her.

It is much less rude for women to return a recognition coldly, and upon
the next occasion to turn away or to avoid a meeting, than to give a
“cut direct.”

A man precedes a woman in passing through a crowd; but women precede
men under ordinary circumstances.

It is not proper for a young girl to walk alone with a young man after
dark, unless she is engaged to him or he is a near relative of hers.
A young woman should meet a young man with whom she has only a slight
acquaintance under her father’s or a proper guardian’s roof. When he
has become well acquainted with her and her family or friends, she may
take occasional walks with him alone in the afternoon, but never in the
evening.

When two women meet in a door-way, the younger gives precedence to the
elder.

A man does not first offer to shake hands with a woman unless he is
very well acquainted with her.

When it becomes necessary for one to address a man or woman whose name
one does not know, it should be as “Sir” or “Madam.”

It is very bad taste for young women to eat candy during a theatrical
performance, or, indeed, in any public place.


TRAVELING.

One can travel all over the United States alone, and if she conducts
herself quietly, and as a lady should, she will receive all due
respect. At the same time it is perhaps a little wiser to have a friend
with one, or even, if that is not possible, to be put in the care of
some one who is making the same journey.

When a young woman is traveling alone and is obliged to stay at a
hotel, she is shown to a reception room and sends for a clerk to come
to her. After the business arrangements are made, she either gives him
a card or tells him her name, and he registers for her. There is no
reason why she should go into a public room or register herself.

It is not customary, unless one is without luggage, to pay in advance
at a hotel.

Fees are usually given on leaving the steamer to the steward or
stewardess, deck steward, head waiter, waiter of the particular table
at which one has taken his meals, and any other servants who have made
themselves useful to him during the voyage. The amount of the fees
depends on the amount of the service that has been required, varying
from $1 to $5 for each. Living in lodgings abroad is much cheaper than
living in hotels, and in most of the large cities such accommodations
may be had at reasonable rates, and are very comfortable. The prices
for lodging vary according to location, etc. A steamer trunk should
suffice for a traveler who makes a short trip abroad and intends to
spend all his time traveling and sight-seeing. Money for a short
trip can be carried on the person, in a belt, or a pocket hung about
the neck. For a trip of some length a letter of credit is more
convenient, and can be obtained from any banking-house having foreign
connections. In some countries traveling in the second-class carriages
is very comfortable; in others it is not. In Italy a traveler can be
comfortable only by traveling first-class; in France second-class is
not bad; and in Germany and Great Britain it is perfectly comfortable,
and preferable to first-class in many respects.

A rush and scramble at a railway ticket office is only carried on by
ill-bred people, or by those who appear so at the time.

If a woman offers to seat herself beside a man, he should rise at once
and give her the choice of seats.

No real gentlemen would be unmindful of the comfort and convenience of
women, while traveling, from a selfish motive.

In the cars one has no right to keep a window open, if the current of
air thus produced annoys another.

A woman should always be careful to thank a person for any little
attention he may bestow upon her while traveling.


BICYCLING.

As to rules of politeness for bicyclers, one who is a true lady will
show herself to be one as surely when riding a wheel as at any other
time, not only by her costume, which will be unobtrusive in color, cut,
and adjustment, but by her manner, which will be even more quiet and
self-possessed than usual, as she well knows that by mounting a wheel
she makes herself more or less conspicuous. It goes without saying that
she will not ride fast enough to attract undue attention; that she will
not chew gum; and that she will not allow advances from strangers,
who may, like herself, be on a wheel, and, to all appearances, may be
gentlemen. Neither will she ride off alone after dark, nor take long
rides in the evening attended only by an escort. In the daytime, when
out only with a man friend, she will avoid stopping to rest under the
trees and in out of the way places. Too much care cannot be taken,
especially by young girls, as to appearances. Their very innocence and
ignorance lays them open to criticism.


TELEPHONING.

For the benefit of those who but seldom make use of the telephone, and
consequently feel more or less ill at ease when attempting to use one,
and also for those who, from ignorance of the first laws of politeness,
or who, from thoughtlessness, ignore them, a few hints upon the subject
may not come amiss. It is after having called up “Central,” and been
given the number requested, that one often stands in need of no small
amount of tact and good breeding, as well as of some idea of the best
method of procedure. When there are several different persons using
the same line, two or three of them may mistake the call for theirs,
and all rush to the telephone at once. If at all stupid, or lacking in
politeness, they will make it quite unpleasant for each other. The one
entitled to speak should politely inquire for the one for whom she has
called at the telephone, also giving her own name as the one delivering
the message. If this does not suffice to enlighten those who sometimes
keep calling “hello,” “hello,” without waiting to learn if they are
the ones desired, the one talking should again announce herself, and
the name of the one to whom she wishes to speak. Then, occasionally,
even while in the midst of a conversation, some one will break in
with a “Hello!” “Who is it?” “What do you want?” etc., which is quite
distracting. If one can gain a hearing in no other way, it is well to
say: “Excuse me, I hold the line.” If this does not bring order out of
chaos, one should ring off and call again.

One should be careful not to call up friends at inconvenient hours,
and when one is notified by a servant, or otherwise, that someone, the
name being given, is at the telephone wishing to speak with her, she
should certainly be as expeditious as possible in replying; for, by
holding the wire, she is inconveniencing others, as well as the one
who is waiting for her. No lady needs to be warned against speaking
discourteously under any circumstances to the telephone assistants at
the central office. It is in these little things that one shows herself
to be well-bred or not.

None, of course, but the most informal of invitations can be delivered
by telephone.

Servants should be taught always to answer the telephone politely and
intelligently. When answering, a servant should say whose residence it
is, if asked, not by giving the family name, as “Smith,” but as “Mr.
Smith,” and then, if asked who is at the instrument, she should reply,
“Mrs. Smith’s cook” or “maid.”

One’s individual manners, and ordinary polite or impolite forms of
address, are very noticeable when accentuated by the telephone.

CHAPTER VI.

THE TABLE AND SERVICE AT TABLE, HABITS AT TABLE, SERVANTS AND SERVING.

    “God may forgive sins, but awkwardness has no
    forgiveness in Heaven or earth.”—_Hawthorne._


THE TABLE AND SERVICE AT TABLE.

The table looks best when not over-decorated. The housekeeper who
cannot make changes in her table decoration finds that a mirror
centerpiece is a background that multiplies the beauty of her flowers,
fruit, leaves, or whatever may constitute the decoration.

A unique and effective decoration for a luncheon table is made of long,
narrow bouquets of white carnations, tied with bows of yellow satin
ribbon, and arranged so that the ribbons all meet in the center of the
table, while the points are directed towards the guests. The effect is
of a great golden-hearted daisy.

A pretty conceit for decorating a dainty table is to cluster a number
of small palms together in the center of the table. Around these place
small ferns, while beyond the latter arrange yards of smilax so as to
conceal the pots. Outside of all have a flat border composed of loose
bunches of pinks, roses, and maiden-hair ferns. Tie these with wide
pink satin ribbons, a long end of which should extend from each bouquet
down to the place of each of the women guests, and have her name
painted in gold upon it. Then there should be _boutonnières_ of pink
carnations for the men.

Menu cards are not ordinarily used at any but the most formal kind of
an entertainment. They are always seen at large functions, men’s public
dinners, etc., which are usually given in a hotel or restaurant; but
in a private house individual menu cards, whether at a dinner or a
luncheon, are exceptional.

When the dinner is large and formal, or even when it numbers only eight
or ten, it is wise to have small cards with the names of the guests
at each place at the table, and, if the guests are strangers to each
other, to have a tray in the men’s dressing-room or hall where they
remove their coats and hats with tiny envelopes addressed to each,
containing little cards on which is written the name of the dinner
partner. The hostess must see that, as soon as two dinner partners are
in the receiving room before dinner, they meet each other, and have a
chance for a little conversation before the meal is announced; and she
should also make a point to introduce each woman before dinner to the
man who is to sit on the other side of her.

Introductions are not proper at the table, and at a large dinner it is
awkward to introduce all one’s guests to each other before the meal.
At a small dinner, of course, it is not necessary to observe all this
formality, and the hostess may introduce her guests to each other
without much ceremony, when the company numbers only four or six; but
with more, each woman should be provided with a partner who escorts her
to the table. At a small function there need be but a few minutes of
waiting before the guests are all seated. The guest of honor sits at
the right of the host.

As to the manner of arranging the table, there is some difference
of opinion. However, generally speaking, there should be a napkin,
squarely folded, in front of each guest, and at the left of it the
forks, _i. e._, a fish fork and a large and a small ordinary fork.
At the right of the napkin should be the knives and spoons, a glass,
bread-and-butter plate (if used), and a salt cellar; and in the center
of the table on an embroidered centerpiece or circular mirror, the
floral decorations. At the head of the table, upon an embroidered
square, are laid the tea service,—the urn, the cups and saucers, the
cream pitcher, sugar bowl, etc.; at the other end are placed the dishes
for serving. Scattered about on circular doilies are the dishes of
jelly, preserves, pickles (sweet and sour), olives, salted almonds, etc.

Chafing-dishes are used to prepare such dishes as terrapin, oysters, or
whatever may be cooked absolutely on the table. A napkin and plate, or
tray, is best liked for removing crumbs.

Finger bowls should always follow the last course at formal and
informal meals alike, except at breakfast, when, if fruit is the first
course, the finger-bowl is put on the table when the covers are laid
ready for the fruit course.

Spoon-holders are no longer used, but if one should be fancied it would
be better to put the bowl of the spoon in the holder first.

Unless one serves something more than wafers, small cakes, tea, and
chocolate on an “at home” day, napkins are not necessary; if, however,
there is some dish that will soil the fingers or the lips, then there
should be a pile of small napkins on the tea-table.

Tooth-picks should not be put on the table, nor should they be used
outside one’s own room.

It is not necessary to fold one’s napkin when only one meal is to be
eaten in the house in which one is staying.

The day for tying cakes, sandwiches, etc., with ribbons has passed.

The waitress should stand with a tray in her hand behind the host’s
chair to receive each plate as it is filled, passing it to the left
of the guest, and waiting for him to remove it. When the hostess is
pouring tea or coffee, the maid’s place is by her left side in waiting
for the cups. After that she should be on the alert to see when the
glasses need filling, or when there is bread, pickles, or anything to
be passed. When removing the plates it should be from the right side of
the guest, but everything should be offered at the left that the right
hand may be used to receive it.

When a dish is passed and there is no maid in attendance, one should
help himself and pass it on. If a dish is standing near one, under such
circumstances, he may quite properly ask if he may help himself, and do
so.

When a plate is passed for a helping, the knife and fork are laid well
to the side of the plate, so placed that they will not fall off, and
yet not be in the way of the server.

All the appurtenances of each course should be removed before the
succeeding one is served. The bread-and-butter plates, however, should
be removed before the salad course, as crackers and cheese are passed
with this, the salad plate being used to hold all three things.

The salted almonds should be started about the table by the hostess
soon after the guests are seated. Some hostesses possess cut-glass
or china individual dishes, on which the almonds are placed when the
guest helps himself, but it is quite usual for them to be placed on the
bread-and-butter plate.

Bonbons should be passed by the maid when the coffee is served, and
eaten from the plate from which the finger-bowl and doily have been
removed.

It is not important whether tumblers or goblets are used on the
dinner-table; each season brings its own custom.

The bread-and-butter plates at a formal dinner serve the purpose
only of bread plates, as it is not customary to serve butter on such
occasions. If it is used, however, butter should be made into tiny
balls, and one or two placed on each bread-and-butter plate.

It is customary to put the vegetables served with the meat on the
same plate. The use of individual dishes for vegetables is no longer
approved.

Oranges are seldom served at dinner unless they are specially prepared,
that is, with the skin taken off, and the sections divided, in which
case the fruit is eaten from a fork.

Cheese and crackers of some sort are always served with salad courses.

At a formal dinner bouillon or consommé is usually served in
soup-plates. At a supper or luncheon it is oftenest served in cups. The
regulation cups are those having handles on each side.

When oysters are served on the half-shell, they are usually placed upon
the table before the meal is announced.

It is not customary to serve fruit as a first course at dinner, though
at a lunch it is quite proper.

Grape-fruit must be served ice cold. It is served in two ways: either
it is cut in halves, midway between the blossom and the stem end, the
seeds removed, the pulp loosened with a sharp knife, but served in
the natural skin, to be eaten with a spoon; or the pulp and seeds are
entirely removed from the skin with a sharp knife, and the edible part
only served in deep dessert plates. Pulverized sugar should accompany
grape-fruit.

In waiting upon plates, one should never pour gravy on the food, but
place it at one side.

The salad course at dinner always succeeds the game course.

After dinner coffee is served in small cups and without cream. In
many houses rock-candy, crushed in very small pieces, is used as a
substitute for sugar, the claim being made that it gives a purer
sweetness.

Cut sugar is served with coffee, and powdered sugar with fruit or
oatmeal.

Coffee may be served at the table or in the drawing-room as is best
liked. People are not asked if they will have it; it is served to them.
Only sugar is offered with black coffee.


HABITS AT TABLE.

Nothing indicates the good breeding of a man so much as his manners
at table. There are a thousand little points to be observed, which,
although not absolutely necessary, distinctly stamp the refined and
well-bred man. A man may pass muster by dressing well, and may sustain
himself tolerably in conversation; but, if he is not nearly perfect in
table etiquette, dining will betray him.

Any unpleasant peculiarity, abruptness, or coarseness of manner is
especially offensive at table. People are more easily disgusted at
that time than at any other.

One should never rest the arms upon the table, but keep the left hand,
when not in use, lying quietly in the lap.

A man guest should never precede his hostess into or out of the
dining-room, but should wait respectfully by the door for her to pass.

A soup-plate should never be tilted for the last spoonful.

The mouth should be kept closed in eating, and as little noise made as
possible.

A goblet should be held by the stem, and not by the bowl.

Bread should be broken and not cut before buttering it to eat.

A knife should never be used at table except where one is unable to cut
his food with his fork; it should never be used in conveying food to
the mouth.

A knife should be held by its handle, and the finger not allowed to
extend up on the blade. In eating with a fork it should be held in the
right hand.

The fork is generally used with the tines curving upward.

Olives are eaten from the fingers; pickles, from a fork. It is usual to
put either a small fork or a long-handled spoon with a small bowl on
the dish containing olives or pickles, and one should use it in helping
one’s self.

The tips of the fingers are put in the finger-bowls and may then
moisten the lips. Both lips and finger tips are dried on the napkin,
which is not afterwards folded.

Watermelons are eaten with a fork, and cantaloupes with either a spoon
or a fork.

A baked potato should be eaten from the plate after it has been pushed
out of its skin by the fork.

Dried beef is eaten with a fork.

Grape seeds may be removed from the mouth with the fingers. The seeds
of watermelons should be taken from the fruit with a fork before the
fruit is put into the mouth.

Fish bones are taken from the mouth with the fingers. Care, however, is
usually taken to leave as few bones as possible in the fish, since the
general use of the silver knife with the silver fork has made it easy
to separate the bones from the meat.

Bananas are broken with a fork, and a piece is conveyed to the mouth on
a fork.

When a servant offers one a dish, he should help himself without taking
it from her hand.

When drinking from a cup, the spoon should be left in the saucer, where
it also remains when the cup is empty.

It is not proper to eat gravy with bits of bread; instead, it should be
regarded as a sauce, and simply eaten on the meat of which it forms a
portion.

It is decreed by custom that the small bones of any bird may be taken
in the fingers, and the meat eaten from the bone. But this must always
be done daintily.

What is known as “layer cake” is eaten from a fork, and in serving it
one uses either a pie-knife or a tablespoon and a fork.

Cheese is eaten with a fork.

After-dinner coffee is taken directly from the cup, and not from the
spoon.

Crackers should be eaten from the hand, and not be broken into soup.

When bread is passed, one takes a slice as it is cut, and does not
break it and leave a portion on the plate. Bread is always eaten from
the fingers.

Raw oysters are eaten with a small oyster-fork from the shell. In
helping one’s self to salt, the little salt-spoon is used, and the salt
is placed on the plate.

When strawberries are served with their stems on, one picks one up by
the stem, dips it into the soft sugar at the side of the plate, and
eats it from the stem. Bonbons are eaten from the fingers. If a spoon
is in the dish from which they are served, then one uses it; if not,
the fingers are proper.

An apple or a pear may be held on a fork, and pared with a knife; or it
may be quartered, and each quarter held in the fingers, and then pared.
Dates are eaten from the fingers.

When one answers “thank you” to an invitation to partake of a certain
dish at the table, “yes” is meant.

One should break a small piece of bread off the slice, then butter it
and eat it. Only very small children in the nursery bite from a slice
of buttered bread.

One need not fear to take the last piece on the plate when it is
offered. It would be more impolite to refuse it.

It is very bad form to pile up, or in any way arrange the plates or
small dishes put before one, for the benefit of the waiter. She should
do her own work, which is to take away the plates without any help.

When one wishes for bread, or anything of that sort, he should simply
ask for it, either addressing his request to the servant or, if there
is none, to whomever the bread may be nearest, if it is on the table.

Upon leaving the table, and the signal for leaving is given when the
hostess rises, one’s napkin should be placed upon the table unfolded,
unless one is to remain for another meal.

At a formal dinner party the host should enter the dining-room first
and with the lady in whose honor the dinner is given; the hostess goes
into the dining-room last with the most important man guest, who should
be seated at her right.

Where menus are used they should be placed on the left-hand side,
beside the forks. When the dinner is over, at a signal from the
hostess, the women rise and retire to the drawing-room, where coffee
is usually served, the men remaining in the dining-room for coffee and
cigars.

Five o’clock tea may be served in a variety of ways: the hostess may
brew it herself in a teapot upon her tea-table in the parlor; she
may make it by pouring boiling water over a tea-ball; or it may be
served by either a man or maid servant in the dining-room. Its proper
accompaniments are sugar, cream, sliced lemon, and either wafers, thin
sandwiches, or cake.

It is in better form to have a luncheon served at a large table,
especially when the guests do not number more than twenty, than to have
small tables. Two o’clock is the fashionable hour for a luncheon;
after it is over the guests usually disperse.

A host, in entertaining at a hotel or a restaurant, even if he
entertains only one woman, should give the order for the meal himself,
and save her the slight embarrassment it may be for her to make her
own selection. The most courteous thing is for him to order the meal
beforehand, but if the occasion is very informal and he prefers to
wait until they are at the table, he should, after he and his guest
are seated, hand the menu to her and ask if she has any especial
preference, and then, respecting her wishes, give the order himself to
the waiter.

If, however, friends happen in, and are asked informally to stay to
a meal at a hotel, they may order themselves what they want from the
menu, and, if necessary, the host or hostess of the occasion may pay
the bill before leaving the dining-room, but the bill should not be
paid until the guests have departed.

In giving one’s order for dinner at the hotel, oysters come first, then
soup, fish, a roast or a bird, ices, whatever dessert may be desired,
and coffee. Very often a woman is well served, when she is alone, by
allowing the waiter to arrange a dinner for her.

If the only guest at the family dinner-table is a man, he should not be
served until all the ladies of the family have been attended to.

If the hostess is the only woman at the table, she is served first,
as a lady is of most importance from a social standpoint, and it is
always proper to attend to her wants first. After her the man who is a
visitor, or whose age gives him precedence, receives attention.

The guest of honor at a tea arrives a little earlier than the other
guests, and remains somewhat later, but at a luncheon or dinner she
should appear at the regulation time. One should remove one’s gloves
at a luncheon, but the retaining of the hat is entirely a matter of
personal taste.

The inconsiderate guest who arrives late for luncheon or dinner is
shown immediately into the dining-room, and the hostess does not leave
her guests, but simply rises and motions him to a seat when he enters
the room.

Ten minutes is the time usually allowed for each course where more than
a six-course dinner is served.

The correct and usual way of seating a bridal party at a wedding
entertainment is for the groom to sit at one end of the table, and
the bride at the other end, the best man on the bride’s right, and
the maid of honor or first bridemaid on the groom’s right. The other
bridemaids and ushers are placed wherever seems best. As a usual thing,
the parents of the bride and groom do not sit at the same table with
the immediate bridal party, but at another table, together with the
near relatives on both sides, and perhaps the minister who officiated
at the wedding and his wife; but if it seems desirable to have the
parents at the bridal table, it is perfectly proper to seat them there.

There are certain distinctive features of a bridal table which must be
in evidence. One is the wedding or bride’s cake, and this cake should
be the central ornament, and should be surrounded with a wreath of
roses. The place-cards should have the initials of the bride and groom
woven together for decoration, and the souvenirs may be small satin
boxes containing wedding cake.


SERVANTS AND SERVING.

There is so much to say upon the subject of servants, notwithstanding
so much has already been said, it is difficult to know where to begin.
But, in the first place, every woman should remember that servants are,
like herself, human, and that in our free America, they are becoming
very independent, not to say self-assertive. Thus a house mistress has
no small matter to deal with when she demands obedience and respectful
attention from girls who are generally ignorant, and often impudent
and ill-bred. The greatest strength of the mistress lies in her power
to control herself, and while she must demand respectfulness from her
servants, she can often avoid a clash with them by using a little tact.
If they are treated in a kind, though dignified, manner, unless very
degenerate, they will usually respond satisfactorily.

One can speak, with perfect propriety, of the one servant employed as
“the maid,” but not as “our girl.”

Servants should be expected to dress neatly, and where there is but
one, she should have a clean white apron ready to put on when answering
the door-bell, being prepared with a tray to receive the caller’s card.
She should also know, before answering the bell, who is in and who is
not at home, and what excuse, if any, to make for each one called for.

Servants should never be allowed to call any member of the family from
a distance, as from the foot of the stairs, but should go to the one to
whom she wishes to speak, and deliver her message.

It is hard to say, under all circumstances, what to expect of a nursery
governess, and what should be her privileges. To treat her with the
greatest consideration is well worth while; for one is compensated in
being able to get an intelligent, ladylike woman who may be trusted
to guide her charges wisely. One may ask a governess to sleep in the
same room with the children, dress and undress them, eat with them, and
teach them, and take the entire charge of them; but, of course, one
will provide some attractive place for her to sit during the evening,
while the children are asleep in her room. It is also necessary to see
that her meals are well cooked and carefully served, and to permit
her to be free one afternoon and evening every week. She should be
addressed as “Miss Smith,” not by her first name.

It is expedient to supervise the work of the general house-work servant
as much as possible; and if it is more convenient for her to go up the
front stairs to announce callers, and to go down them to answer the
front door, certainly allow her to use the front stairs instead of the
back ones on occasions. A waitress or parlor-maid is no more privileged
to use the front stairs than a general house-work servant. A nurse may
be, with propriety, wherever her charges are allowed.

If a maid is expected to wear a cap, it is usually furnished by the
lady of the house.

It is good form to address the servants one knows when entering a
house, and to thank them for any attention.

It is unfortunate that the English system of feeing has come into vogue
here. But it is quite customary now, for a guest, after a visit, even a
short one, to bestow upon a servant a small fee, say, of a dollar.

CHAPTER VII.

FUNERALS, MOURNING.

    Civility implies self-sacrifice; it is the last touch,
    the crowning perfection of a noble character.—_Mathews._


FUNERALS.

At no place is a lack of system, and an observance of formality, more
noticeable than at a funeral. An undertaker generally has charge
of the details, and where he is well informed and has sufficient
assistance, he can manage affairs nicely, but there is a great deal of
unostentatious service that may be done by friends, indeed, must be.
They can assist the servants in arranging the house, flowers, etc.,
before the funeral; meet any who may call at the door; and in every way
stand between the afflicted family and the outside world. Of course
none but intimate friends can be of service at such a time. All others,
no matter how willing, can but call at the door with offers of service,
and even that should not be carried far enough to appear intrusive.

At a house funeral the family remains upstairs, or in a side room,
and is not seen. The remains are in the drawing-room, where they are
usually viewed by those present when passing out. The clergyman stands
near the head of the casket, if in so doing his voice can be well
heard. If there is singing, it is usually done by a quartet or by a
smaller number of persons, who are seated at the head of the stairs out
of sight and unaccompanied by any musical instrument. Those who are not
going to the cemetery quietly disperse at the close of the service.
Carriages are in waiting for the family, and the cortege moves as soon
after the close of the service as possible.

In the meantime the nurse (if one still remains at the house), or some
friend, with the assistance of the servants, makes everything look as
natural and pleasant as possible before the return of the family. If
visitors come in later, of course it depends upon circumstances whether
or not they should be admitted.

Church funerals are more formal. The congregation assembles, and when
the carriages containing the family arrive, the organ plays softly, and
the procession enters, the relatives walking close to the casket, and
sitting as near it as possible. After the services the procession moves
out in the same order, and the people in the pews wait until is has
passed on.

The crêpe that is hung at the door-bell has often combined with it
ribbon streamers, those for the aged being black, for a younger person
purple, and for a child white with white crêpe also. Flowers should be
sent to the bereaved, in due time after the death, in token of sympathy.


MOURNING.

The putting on of mourning is a question that should be decided
entirely by those most deeply concerned. Many families never follow the
custom, and even wear white instead of black on the day of the funeral,
while others seem to consider the wearing of crêpe as a mark of respect
shown to the dead. To assume the expense such a change in clothing
would entail, may sometimes be placing a burden upon the living for
the sake of the dead, which certainly neither custom nor reason should
demand. Then, to many, the wearing of crêpe is so depressing that it
is a sin against one’s self to put it on. None but narrow-minded,
uncultivated persons would ever think of criticising one for not doing
so. Of course one would naturally feel like dressing in as subdued
colors as possible, if not in assuming half mourning (black and white,
lavendar, drab, etc.) if not deep black or crêpe.

When mourning is worn by a wife for a husband, it is worn from one to
two years, at least.

The question of wearing mourning for one’s betrothed must be decided
by one’s self, for it is purely a personal question that the laws of
etiquette do not govern.

When crêpe is laid aside, black-bordered paper and black-bordered cards
are no longer proper. While wearing all black on the street, after
crêpe is laid aside, one may wear, with propriety, all white in the
house.

While in deep mourning one does not go into society. All that mourning
etiquette demands is that one acknowledge her calls with her visiting
cards, which should be sent in return for a call within two weeks after
it is made, and should go by hand rather than by mail.

One sends invitations to one’s friends who are in mourning, to show
that they are not forgotten.




CHAPTER VIII.

POLITENESS OF YOUNG CHILDREN.

    Give a boy address and accomplishments, and you give
    him the mastery of palaces and fortunes wherever he
    goes.—_Ralph Waldo Emerson._


A mother once asked a clergyman when she should begin to educate her
child, then three years old. “Madam,” was his reply, “you have lost
three years already.”

As soon as the child can talk, its lessons in politeness should begin.
Among a child’s first words should be “please” and “thank you.”

A child should never be allowed to leave the table, after it is old
enough to understand and to say it, without asking to be excused.

A child should be taught to pass behind and not before one.

Little boys should never be allowed to keep their hats on in the house.

Children, when very young, should be taught to be generous and polite
to their little visitors, and, if necessary, to give up all of anything
where half will not do.

Children should be taught to “take turns” in playing games, and that no
one should monopolize the pleasantest part of a game.

Children soon feel a pride in being little ladies and gentlemen, rather
than in being rude and impolite.

If mothers would impress upon their children’s minds how stupid they
appear when they stand staring at one without answering when addressed
with “good morning” or a like salutation, they would be anxious to know
what to say, and to say it.

Children do not always know what to answer when addressed. They ought
to be taught, so that they may feel no embarrassment.

When children inconvenience others, they ought to be taught to say
“excuse me” or “beg pardon.”

In the cars, or in any public place, a boy or a girl should always
rise, and give his or her place to an older person.

A child should always learn that it is both naughty and rude to
contradict, and to say “what for” and “why,” when told to do anything.

A mother who is as careful of her child’s moral nature and manners as
of his physical nature, will guard him from naughty and rude playmates
as closely as she would from measles or whooping-cough.

A mother should never allow any disrespect in her children’s manners
toward herself, nor toward any one older than they are. They should be
taught especially to reverence the aged.

Habits of politeness and kindness to the poor are of great worth, and
easily formed in childhood.

Virtue is born of good habits, and the formation of habits may be said
to constitute almost the whole work of education.

Habits have been compared to handcuffs, easily put on and difficult to
rid one’s self of.

Those parents who regulate their lives in accordance with the commands
of the Bible, find many verses which are of great assistance in
teaching politeness to young children, such as, “Be ye courteous one to
another,” “Be respectful to your elder,” “Do to others as ye would that
they should do to you,” etc.

A child should be thoroughly trained with regard to table manners. The
well-bred child will not chew his food with his mouth half open, talk
with it in his mouth, nor make any unnecessary noises in eating; and he
will handle his knife and fork properly.

Children should be taught that it is very rude to look into drawers or
boxes, or, in fact, to meddle with or handle anything away from home
that is not intended for them to play with.

Children should be made to understand that they must not ask too many
questions promiscuously, such as, “Where are you going?” “What have you
there?” etc.

A child should be taught never to tease a playmate’s mother, or to have
its own mother teased by a playmate. Teasing should not be allowed.

Children should never be allowed to say “I won’t” and “I will,” even to
each other.

Children should never be allowed to speak of an elder person by the
last name without the proper prefix. They should also be taught, in
addressing boys and girls, say, sixteen years of age, to use the
prefix, as “Miss” or “Mr.,” before the given name; thus “Miss Alice”
or “Mr. George.” In fact, all people should observe this rule in
addressing the young, except in case the older person is very familiar
with the younger, or in case the latter is too young to be so addressed.

Children are now taught to say, “Yes, mamma,” “What, mamma?” “Thank
you, mamma,” “Yes, Mrs. Allen,” “What, Mrs. Allen?” etc., in preference
to “Yes, ma’am,” “No, ma’am,” etc.

Children should be taught that it is rude to yawn without trying to
suppress it, or without concealing the mouth with the hand; to whistle
or hum in the presence of older persons; or to make any monotonous
noise with feet or hands, beating time, etc.; to play with napkin
rings, or any article at table during meal time; to pick the teeth
with the fingers; to trim or clean one’s nails outside one’s room; to
lounge anywhere in the presence of company; to place the elbows on the
table, or to lean upon it while eating; to speak of absent persons by
their first names, when they would not so address them if they were
present; to acquire the habit of saying “you know,” “says he,” “says
she;” to use slang words; to tattle; to hide the mouth with the hand
when speaking; to point at anyone or anything with the finger; to stare
at persons; to laugh at one’s own stories or remarks; to toss articles
instead of handing them; to leave the table with food in the mouth; to
take possession of a seat that belongs to another without instantly
rising upon his return; to leave anyone without saying “good-by;” to
interrupt any one in conversation; to push; to ridicule others; to
pass, without speaking, any one whom they know; etc.

Some young people are not as particular as they should be about certain
articles of the toilet, such as combs, brushes, etc. One should always
have such things for his own individual use. It is exceedingly
impolite to use any toilet article belonging to another.

It is ill-mannered to ask questions about affairs that do not concern
one, or to pry into the private affairs of one’s friends. To inquire
the cost of articles indiscriminately, is impudent.

If parents are not at home when visitors come in, or are too busy to
see them at once, a child, in the absence of a maid, should politely
show them in, offer them a comfortable chair, show them anything he
thinks they will be interested in, and make every effort to entertain
them agreeably until such time as his parents can take his place. He
should then politely withdraw from the room.

Children and young people should early learn not to monopolize the best
light or the most desirable seat in the room, but to look about when
anyone enters, whether a guest or an older member of their own family,
and see if by giving up their own place the new-comer may be made more
comfortable.

A boy ought to show to his mother and sisters every attention he would
show to any other woman. Should they chance to meet on the street he
should politely raise his hat. He should allow them to pass first
through a door, give them the inside of the walk, help them into a
carriage, and everywhere and under all circumstances treat them with
politeness and deference. Girls should of course treat their brothers
in the same polite manner; for they can hardly expect to receive
attentions where they are unwilling to bestow them.

Children, especially little boys, should be taught not to precede their
mothers, or any woman, into theaters, street cars, churches, elevators,
or into the house or even a room.


SCHOOL-ROOM ETIQUETTE.

    “Good manners are the shadows of virtues, if not
    virtues themselves.”

If teachers realized the inestimable amount of good they might
accomplish by giving a little time and thought to the manners of their
pupils, surely they would willingly give it. Those of their pupils who
have no proper training at home would thus gain a knowledge which, in
after life, would prove a blessing. And such a course acted upon by the
teacher would be of great assistance to the parents of those who are
well trained at home; for a large portion of a child’s time is spent in
school, and under conditions that require such training.

Teachers must treat their scholars politely if they expect polite
treatment from them.

Every teacher should see that no pupil is allowed to treat those of a
lower station in life with disrespect.

It is a common occurrence for a teacher to speak with seeming
disrespect of a pupil’s parents, blaming them for the pupil’s lack of
interest in school, truancy, etc. Such a course is highly reprehensible
in the teacher, and gains the pupil’s ill-will. It is better to assume
that the parents would be displeased with anything wrong in the pupil,
and to appeal to the pupil for his mother’s or father’s sake.

A teacher should never allow herself or himself to be addressed by
pupils as “Teacher,” but as Miss or Mr. Smith.

If pupils would take pains to bid a teacher “good-morning” and
“good-night,” they would appear well in so doing, and easily give
pleasure to another.

The entire atmosphere of a school-room is dependent upon trifles. Where
a teacher, by her own actions and in accordance with her requirements,
insures kindness and politeness from all to all, she may feel almost
sure of the success of her school.

Young misses ought to be addressed by the teacher as “Miss Julia,”
“Miss Annie.” Young boys (too young to be addressed as Mr.) should be
addressed as “Master Brown,” “Master Jones,” etc.

Teachers should use great discretion in reproving any unintentional
rudeness, especially on the part of those ignorant from lack of home
training. If such were reproved gently and privately, it would be
more efficacious and just. No one should be allowed to appear to
disadvantage from ignorance.

Selfishness, untruthfulness, slang, rowdyism, egotism, or any show of
superiority should be corrected in the school-room.

Young teachers hardly realize with what fear and dread mothers intrust
to them their carefully reared children, especially young ones.

CHAPTER X.

OFFICIAL ETIQUETTE.

    “Good fashion rests on realty, and hates nothing so
    much as pretenders.”—_Emerson._


All presentations to foreign courts are made through the national
representatives, and from them is received all the information desired
in reference to the necessary forms and ceremonies.

Kings and queens are addressed as “Your Majesty.” The Prince of Wales,
the crown princes, and all other princes and princesses are addressed
as “Your Royal Highness.”

The President’s “levees” at Washington are open to all, and are
conducted very much as an ordinary “reception.” As one enters, an
official announces him, and he proceeds directly to the president and
his lady, and pays his respects.

The door of the White House may be said never to be closed, and any
one who desires may call upon its occupants as upon those of any other
dwelling. He may not, however, obtain a personal interview. This, to be
secured, he must seek in the company of an official or intimate friend
of the president, who will be able to judge of the claims for attention
of a visitor.

No particular style of dress is required to make one’s appearance at
the Republican Court.

No refreshments are expected to be offered at a presidential reception.

Custom does not require that the wife of the president of the United
States should return official calls. Exception is made in the case of
visiting Royalty. The wives of the foreign ambassadors should make the
first call upon the wife of the vice-president, as should the wives
of the cabinet officials. At a function given by officials of foreign
governments at Washington, the wife of the secretary of state takes
precedence over the wives of the foreign ambassadors.

CHAPTER XI.

BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE, APPLICATIONS, ETC.

    Since custom is the principal magistrate of human
    life, let men by all means endeavor to obtain good
    customs.—_Lord Bacon._


CORRESPONDENCE.

BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE.

Closely written postal cards and long letters meet with little favor
among business men; therefore it is important to make business
correspondence as plain and brief as possible.

Names of places and persons should be written very plainly.

When a letter is written in reply to another, the date of the letter to
which the reply is made should be given, and it is an excellent plan,
and one that saves much time, to give in a letter the substance of the
one to which it is a reply. This is especially desirable when accepting
a special offer made in such letter, thus:

    Mr. A. FLANAGAN, Chicago, Illinois.

    _Dear Sir:_

    Your favor of Feb. 15, in which you offer us a discount
    of 33-1/3 per cent. on your books, when purchased in
    lots of 100 or more, came duly. We herewith enclose
    our check for three hundred dollars ($300.), for which
    please ship us, by freight the following:

  100 copies of “Words; Their Use and Abuse.”
  100    “      “Getting on in the World.”
  100    “      “Hours with Men and Books.”

                                    Respectfully,
                                      GEO. W. JONES & CO.

    Boulder, Colo., April 3, 1899.


    Griggsville, Ill. MESSRS. HARPER & BROTHERS, New York.

    _Gentlemen:_

    Enclosed is a post-office order for $3, for which
    please send me Harper’s New Monthly Magazine for one
    year, beginning with the May number.

                              Respectfully,
                                     (MISS) SARA BROWN.

When writing a business letter, a married woman should sign her name as
she would sign it when writing any other letter; that is, by placing
her first name and surname in the usual position of the signature, and
adding, a little to the left-hand, her name in full, with the address,
thus:

                           St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9th, 1899.

    MESSRS. HARPER & BROTHERS, New York.

    _Gentlemen:_

    Please send me one copy of “How Women Should Ride,” for
    which you will find enclosed one dollar and twenty-five
    cents ($1.25).

                                    Respectfully,
                                         EMMA C. BOWEN.
   MRS. CHARLES E. BOWEN,
          324 Dupont Avenue.

When writing to a person or firm for information solely for one’s own
benefit, a postal card or a stamped envelope should be enclosed for a
reply.

It is a too common custom among people unacquainted with the rules
of business, when sending an order to one firm, to enclose money to
be paid another, or with which to make small purchases in some other
line, to be sent in the package ordered from the firm with which the
correspondence is held. The proper way to do when one wishes to order
goods from different houses in the same city, and yet have all the
goods shipped in the same package, is to write an order to each firm
requesting the goods to be delivered to the firm with which one does
the most business, having, of course, notified such firm of his action.

It has become so common among people to request everything “by return
mail” that business men look upon such requests as a mere form, rather
than as an evidence of urgency. If such urgency exists, it is well to
state the cause of it in a few words, and request immediate attention
to the order, thus:

                            Harvard, Ill., Nov. 2, 1899.

    MESSRS. A. C. MCCLURG & CO., Chicago.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I enclose herewith $2, for which please send me a copy
    of Longfellow’s poetical works. You will oblige me by
    sending the book by return mail, as I wish to use it on
    the evening of the 4th inst.

                                      Respectfully,
                                            JAMES WELLS.

Whoever writes a caustic letter makes a mistake; for it will do no
good, even if there seems to be a cause for it, and if the assumed
cause proves to be simply a mistake the writer will be humiliated.


LETTERS OF APPLICATION.

It is sometimes difficult to write a letter of application, because
one must speak of himself and of his ability to fill the position
sought, and to do so without seeming egotistic. If the applicant has
had experience in work similar to that for which he applies, a simple
statement of the fact, the length of time engaged in such work, the
reason for quitting his last position, and the name and address of his
former employer, should form the substance of his letter. If he has had
no experience, he should state what advantages he has had to qualify
himself for the work, and not boast that he could soon and easily learn
to do it.

The following will exemplify the points:


                                124 La Salle St.,
                                   Chicago, Sept. 24, 1899.

    MESSRS. A. G. BAKER & CO.,
                   Kirkwood, Ohio.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I am informed by a friend, Mr. C. A. Brooks, of your
    village, that you are in want of a book-keeper, and
    I desire to make application for the position. I am
    a young man, but have had several years experience
    in keeping books. I am now in charge of the books of
    Messrs. Jones & Williams, of this city, to whom I
    can refer you for information as to my ability and
    character. I desire to go to the country, and should be
    glad to work for you, if you can pay me $70 per month,
    which is my present salary.

                                 Very respectfully,
                                           T. R. MILLER.


                               Salem, Wis., May 15, 1899.
    MESSRS. CLARK & WILLIAMS,
    107 State Street, Chicago.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I am informed that your shipping clerk is soon to
    leave, and that the position now held by him will be
    vacant. I desire to apply for the same, but I am sorry
    to state that I have not had any experience in this
    particular line of work; however, I have been a general
    clerk in a village store, and am familiar with simple
    book-keeping, which would probably enable me to learn
    the work of a shipping clerk in a reasonable length of
    time.

    In case you should wish to engage me on trial, I would
    gladly assist, without compensation, your present clerk
    until the end of his engagement, which, I understand,
    is about three weeks from date.

    My present employer is Mr. G. W. Webster, of this
    place, and he will doubtless answer any inquiries
    concerning my work that you may address him.

                                  Respectfully,
                                       GEO. E. JOHNSON.

Such letters should always contain a stamp for a reply. The stamp is
attached by its corner or by a pin to the head of the letter.

Great precaution should always be taken not to send a letter with
insufficient postage on it; for the additional postage is collected
from the person to whom the letter is sent, and many business men look
upon such neglect as inexcusable, if they do not consider it dishonest,
inasmuch as it compels others to pay what the writer should have known
it was his duty to pay.

An application for a position as teacher in a public school is often
very difficult to write, because it is necessary to say much, and to
say it, in some cases, to men who are not thoroughly familiar with
business principles.

Before giving any forms, some suggestions which experience has taught
may be of great importance. The handwriting should be natural. If one
has a degree, he should not sign his name with it, but state in his
letter that he is a graduate, naming the institution from which he was
graduated. All boasting should be avoided. One should not ask a reply
by return mail, but he might enclose a postal card or a stamp with a
request to be informed when the board meets to consider applications.
One ought not to name as references persons who know nothing about his
work; for although they may, if consulted, endeavor to praise him,
they will show their ignorance of what he has done, and the board will
naturally assume that he has no better references.

As a rule it is not advisable to give testimonials from ministers or
from county superintendents, unless the writers can say that they are
familiar with the teacher’s work, and have visited his school. Very
old testimonials should not be placed before a board. Indeed, it is
doubtful whether any testimonial, unless it comes from a competent
judge, is of value.

If boards would consult one’s references, or seek information from
outside sources, it would be only just to all concerned; but as they
will not often do this, it is wise to send copies of two or three,
generally not more, good testimonials, and to have one or two of the
applicant’s friends write the board in his behalf.

A letter of application, especially if for the position of
superintendent or that of principal, should be full and explicit,
specifying the opportunities the writer has had to prepare himself for
the position, rather than stating that he has done so-and-so, for in
the latter case it might seem like boasting.

Sometimes a short letter, unless circumstances demand a long one, will
be most favorably received by a board. The writer once knew a very
important position to be obtained by a correspondence about as follows
(names of places, dates, etc., are omitted):

    TO THE HONORABLE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I learn through a friend in your county, that the
    position of superintendent of your school is vacant.
    If the position has not been filled, I desire to make
    application for the same. I am a graduate of ————, and
    have taught three years. I am now principal of the ————
    schools, but desire to teach in your State, as my home
    is there.

                               Respectfully,
                                       —————————

A stamp was enclosed for a reply. The secretary of the board at once
wrote asking for references and stating the salary paid. The applicant
replied that he did not wish the position at the salary named, and
thanked the secretary for the trouble he had been given.

Had the applicant written a long letter, setting forth the value of his
services, and urging the board to raise the salary, it is not probable
that a reply would have been received by him. The simple statement that
he did not want the position at the salary named, was evidence to the
board that he considered his services worth more, and, moreover, that
he had confidence that he would command more. The secretary replied
to the last short note, asking for references and at what salary he
would accept the position. The information was given, and in a few days
the applicant was requested to meet the board with the assurance that
the position would be given him if the interview proved satisfactory,
which it did. Afterwards the applicant was informed by the president of
the board that his short business-like letters, written in an almost
illegible but natural hand, obtained for him the place over nearly
one hundred applicants, many of whom were college graduates of long
experience in teaching, and who had basketfuls of testimonials, but not
one of whom had written even a fairly good letter of application.

Many cities and towns have stated public examinations, which applicants
must attend before they can be employed.

The impression of character and of qualification produced by a personal
interview is deemed so important that even minor appointments are
scarcely given to any one not personally known to one of the school
board, or to some one in whose professional judgment they have great
confidence.

Preliminary inquiries about positions are most profitably made through
acquaintances, who can advise one whether to take any further steps.
One might write as follows:

                            Chicago, Ill., Nov. 3, 1899.

    _My Dear Friend:_

    May I trouble you to ascertain whether there is any
    vacancy in the schools at Elgin, to which I would have
    any prospect of an appointment? You will confer a great
    favor upon me if you will ask the superintendent,
    and let me know soon what he says. You can say to
    him that after I finished the high school course at
    Racine, I taught a term in a district school in Racine
    County, Wis., and was one year in charge of a primary
    department at Woodstock, and that I had charge of the
    grammar department at the latter place last year.

    You know something of the work I have done, and I can
    furnish testimonials from the school officers where I
    have taught.

                              Yours very truly,
                                        EMMA C. BOWEN.

If a favorable answer is received, something like the following form
may be used, which is also a form suitable to make application where
one is already acquainted, and where formal applications are expected.

                       Chicago, Ill., Jan. 10, 1899.

    MR. C. E. RYAN,
          Supt. of Public Schools,
                           Elgin, Ill.

    _Dear Sir:_

    I desire to obtain a position in the schools of your
    city. I enclose a letter from Mr. Henry Jones, a
    director of Woodstock, where I last taught; and I
    refer you to Mrs. Mary Smith, of Elgin. I prefer the
    intermediate work, but would not object to any position
    that I may be able to fill.

    I completed the course in the Racine High School, and
    have taught a little more than two years, first in
    a country school, then in a primary school a year at
    Woodstock, where I afterward had charge of the grammar
    room for a year.

    Please inform me when and by whom candidates are
    examined, as well as what vacancies there are, and be
    kind enough to make any suggestions that you think will
    be helpful to me.

                        Very respectfully,
                               (Miss) EMMA C. BOWEN.

CHAPTER XI.

GENERAL HINTS.

    We remain shackled by timidity till we have learned to
    speak and act with propriety.—_Samuel Johnson._


A man raises his hat when walking with another, not only to his own
acquaintances, but to those persons who bow to his companion, whether
he is acquainted with them or not.

If a man meets a woman in a hotel corridor or hall he should step
aside, allowing her to pass, and raising his hat.

If in a public place a man hands a woman anything she has dropped, he
should raise his hat when offering it to her. A well-bred man raises
his hat after passing the fare of a woman in a car or coach. This does
not mean that he has any desire to become acquainted with her, but it
is his tribute to her sex.

Slight inaccuracies in statements should not be corrected in the
presence of others.

One should give her children, unless married, their Christian names
only, or say “my daughter” or “my son,” in speaking of them to anyone
excepting servants.

Men remove their hats when in elevators in the presence of women.

Men having occasion to pass before women seated in lecture and concert
rooms, and all other places, should “beg pardon,” and pass with their
faces, and not their backs, toward them.

In going up or down stairs, a man precedes a woman or walks by her side.

To indulge in ridicule of another, whether the subject be present or
absent, is to descend below the level of gentlemanly propriety.

A reverence for religious observances and religious opinions is a
distinguishing trait of a refined mind.

Religious topics should be avoided in conversation, except where all
are prepared to concur in a respectful treatment of the subject. In
mixed societies the subject should never be introduced.

Frequent consultation of the watch or time-piece is impolite, either
when at home or abroad. If at home, it appears as if one were tired
of the company and wished them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours
dragged heavily, and one were calculating how soon he would be released.

It is very unbecoming to exhibit petulance or angry feeling, though it
is indulged in largely in almost every circle. The true gentleman does
not suffer his countenance to be easily ruffled.

The right of privacy is sacred, and should always be respected. It
is exceedingly improper to enter a private room without knocking. No
relation, however intimate, will justify an abrupt intrusion upon a
private apartment. Likewise the trunk, boxes, packets, papers, or
letters of any individual, locked or unlocked, sealed or unsealed,
are sacred. It is ill-mannered even to open a book-case, or to read a
written paper lying open, without permission, expressed or implied.

Members of the same family should never differ with each other in
public.

One should never appear to be thinking of his own personal rights to
the resenting of a little slight, whether real or imaginary.

In small communities where near neighbors, for convenience’s sake,
borrow back and forth, great care should be taken that the practice
does not become a nuisance, as it surely does when it is indulged in
too frequently, and when borrowed articles are not speedily returned
and in good condition. There should be no stinted measures in returning.

Ostentation is snobbish, as is all too great profusion.

To affect not to remember a person is despicable, and reflects only on
the pretender.

Some conceited or ill-bred people imagine they make themselves
important and powerful by being rude and insulting.

One is judged, to a great extent, by the character of his associates.

One should be very careful how he asks for the loan of a book. If
interest is shown in one, its owner will offer it for perusal if
willing to lend it. When reading a borrowed book, one should take the
best of care of it, and return it as soon as possible. No real lady
or gentlemen will leave finger prints upon its pages, or turn down
its leaves in place of a book-mark, or scribble in it with a pencil,
or loan it to a third person without the knowledge and consent of the
owner.

A lack of reverence in one in the house of God, implies low parentage,
or a coarse nature that is not subject to refinement.

To whisper and laugh during any public entertainment proclaims one’s
ill-breeding, and invades the rights of others.

One ought never to leave the house after the evening’s entertainment
without bidding the hostess good-night, and acknowledging the pleasure
the evening has afforded him.

The business man has no stock-in-trade that pays him better than a good
address.

It is only those persons and families whose position is not a secure
one, that are afraid to be seen outside their own social circle.

One should never reprove servants or children before strangers.

A true lady will not betray her astonishment at any violation of
conventional rules, least of all will she make it her province to
punish those who may make any such violation.

If one, on meeting another, fails to recall the name, he should frankly
say so.

One should never recall himself to the recollection of a casual
acquaintance without at the same time mentioning his name.

In a flat-house a man should take his hat and coat into the apartment
where he is going to call, and not leave them in the hall on the first
floor.

It is very bad taste, even in quite a large party, for young girls to
visit a man at his office.

It is perfectly good form for a mother to invite to a little child’s
party children whose parents she does not know, or who have not yet
called upon her. The invitations go out in the child’s name and to the
child’s friends.

It is extremely rude and ill-bred, when at a boarding-house or hotel
table, to criticise the food that is served. The fact that it is paid
for makes it none the less an evidence of bad manners. People who are
not satisfied where they are boarding should always leave; they have no
right to make others uncomfortable by their lack of good-breeding.

Women of good-breeding do not permit themselves to “overlook” those to
whom courtesies are due.

A man should learn to put his coat on in a public place of
entertainment so that he will not require assistance from the woman who
is with him.

The young woman to whom a seat is offered should take it, unless her
companion is an older woman, when it would be quite proper to extend
the courtesy to her.

It is very bad taste, even for a frolic, for a young girl to assume
boy’s clothes, or get herself up in any way that will tend to make
herself look masculine.

There is no impropriety in giving to those men friends with whom one is
well acquainted, some trifling souvenir at Christmas or Easter, or on
birthdays.

It is customary for a young man to send a young woman only such gifts
as flowers, candy, and books; and as these presents are sent merely
as a slight return for her hospitality and invitations to her house,
etc., it is not necessary for her to send him any gift in return. If,
however, a young woman and man are on intimate enough terms to exchange
presents, she may send him any small article for the desk or toilet;
such as a silver-handled whisk broom, court-plaster case, pen-wiper,
paper-cutter, or books, which are a good present and always acceptable
to any one.

Nothing looks more ill-bred than to see a young man, under his parents’
roof, devoting himself during a whole evening entirely to one young
woman to the ignoring of the others.

A man who is escorting two women in the street should not walk between
them, but on the outside of both near the curb; at the theater or at
any place of amusement or at church, he should sit nearest to the
aisle, at the side of one of them.

Unless there is some good reason why she needs his support, a man
seldom offers his arm to a woman he escorts, even in the evening. A
husband may offer his arm to his wife, of course, and a man may proffer
this help to an invalid or aged person.

A little delicate perfume may be used with propriety, but a heavy
perfume, and one that scents the entire room in which the person who
uses it happens to be, is in very bad form.

In opening a door from the hall to the drawing-room, a man should hold
it while a woman precedes him in entering.

When one’s pardon is asked for some slight inattention, an inclination
of the head and a smile is the best answer.

The words “gentleman friend” and “lady friend” have been so vulgarized
that most well-bred women now say “man friend” or “woman friend,” it
being taken for granted that they number among their friends only
ladies and gentlemen.

Custom never condones liberties, no matter how slight, between young
men and women.

When a woman is visiting, any acquaintance who should call upon her
should also ask for her hostess, and if she is absent leave a card for
her.

It is considered very bad taste for a young girl to address a man with
whom her acquaintance is but slight by his Christian name.

No young man has any right to spend the entire afternoon and evening
every Sunday at one particular house, to the annoyance of an entire
family, who do not like to make him conscious of the fact that they
consider him a bore.

When a young man is paying a visit, and the older members of the family
are in the room, he should, in leaving, bid them good-night first, and
afterward say his farewell to the young girl on whom he has called. It
is in bad taste for her to go any further than the parlor door with him.

Even if a correspondence is of a “purely friendly character,” it should
not exist between a married woman and a young man, or between a married
man and a young woman.

It is not good taste to ask one’s men friends to buy tickets for
charity affairs. They do not like to refuse, and very often, though the
sum required may be small, they cannot afford it.

There is very great harm in young girls meeting young men in
secret; the men will have no respect for the girls, and nothing but
mortification for the girls will be the result.

It is quite proper to thank any public servant, such as a railroad
conductor, for any information he may give, but it is not necessary to
be effusive about it.

It is not in good taste, nor even proper, for young women to go alone
to a hotel to dine with a man.

When a girl is young and pretty, a Platonic friendship is very
difficult to keep up.

When a man friend has driven a woman in town to go to church he should
take her direct to the church and leave her there while he drives where
his carriage and horses are to wait until after the service. Of course
he would walk to church and join her there.

It is not in good taste for different members of a party to go off in
pairs, and spend the evening alone on the seashore.

It is not wise for a young woman and young man living in the same city
to correspond. If meeting each other often they ought to be able to say
all that is necessary.

One has no right whatever to read a postal card addressed to another
without permission.

The very minute the married man begins to tell of his wife’s faults,
the time has come to cut his acquaintance.

It is more than wrong for a young girl to receive visits from a married
man.

In entering any public place a woman should precede a man, but going
down the aisle, the usher, of course, would precede her.

A hostess stands to receive her visitors, but she does not advance to
meet them unless the visitor should be some one quite old or of such
importance that the visit is of great honor. The hostess extends her
hand to the men who call, as well as to the women.

A woman is not supposed to recognize a man who is one of a group
standing in a public place, since a modest girl will not look close
enough at a group of men to recognize an acquaintance.

No matter how well a woman may know a man, it would be in very bad form
to send him an invitation which does not include his wife, unless it
should be at some affair at which only men are to be present.

A man should show as much courtesy to a woman in his employ as he does
to the women he meets in social life.

It is not in good taste to visit at the home of one’s betrothed, unless
a personal invitation is received from his mother.

Two women may attend, with perfect propriety, a place of amusement
without an escort. They should be, however, under such circumstances,
exceptionally quiet in their manners and their dress.

In escorting a young woman home, a man should go up the steps with her,
wait until the door is opened, and, as she enters the house, raise his
hat and say good-night.

If a young girl were very ill, there would be no impropriety in her
mother bringing her betrothed to see her, although, of course, she
would remain in the room during his visit.

It is always proper and courteous for a person in church to share
either prayer-book or hymnal with anyone who may be without either.

There is no impropriety in a woman’s permitting a man friend to assist
her in putting on her over-shoes.

If one approves of the acting or the sentiment of the play, there is no
impropriety in expressing gentle applause, but a loud clapping of the
hands is decidedly vulgar.

One should never prevent people from leaving his house when they
desire. That is not hospitality. It is tyranny; it is taking a mean
advantage of their unwillingness to offend.

If a women lives in a boarding house and has only one room, it would
be very bad taste to receive any man visitor there. Even if it is not
quite so agreeable, they should be received in the public parlor.

When a man and woman approach a hostess together, the hostess should
shake hands with the woman first.

When a man calls on a woman, he shakes hands with her on his arrival;
but, unless he is very intimate in the house, a simple bow is
sufficient when he leaves.

An unmarried woman writing her name in a hotel register should prefix
it with “Miss” in parentheses.

When a man friend has taken a lady to a concert, she should thank him
for his kindness in having given her a pleasant evening.

It is not advisable for a girl to deliberately “cut” any man. If
she wishes to discontinue her acquaintance with a man whom she
cannot respect, it may be done gradually, at first by the coolest of
greetings; then, by a look in the other direction; and in time all
recognition will cease.

If a stranger takes occasion to be polite to one during a street-car
accident, all that is necessary is a polite “thank you.”

When a man who is to escort a girl to an entertainment calls for her at
her own home, it is proper for her to appear with her wraps on, and be
ready to start at once.

If a man is courteous enough to open the door of a store or any public
building for a woman, she should thank him.

If a girl of sixteen goes to an evening affair, her mother should
arrange to have either a servant or a member of the family go after her
to bring her home.

If the hostess opens the door for a man caller, she should precede him
in entering the parlor.

After having taken a meal or having received any other kind of
entertainment at a private house, before leaving a guest should express
his thanks, or, rather his enjoyment, of the same to the hostess. This
courtesy from a young man or girl is very acceptable to elderly ladies.

Queen Victoria has forgiven certain breaches of etiquette made in
ignorance, and left her guest to discover the mistake at another time.
It is a reprehensible host indeed who does otherwise, and so makes a
guest uncomfortable. Etiquette is all wrong and false when it makes one
forget the higher laws of courtesy or hospitality.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  and Customs of Beavering Men_

  LONDON:

  T. WERNER LAURIE, LTD.

  30, NEW BRIDGE STREET, E.C. 4




A.

IS AN ADMIRAL-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Admiral-Beaver]

The specimen mounted is typical and the coat is good, harsh and not
silky, a common fault in these rough-haired examples.

An Admiral-King-Beaver is unthinkable ... “derogation of God’s honour,”
etc.

Though the sport is deservedly popular in the Service, it is attended
by infinite risk should the specimen be of higher rank than the
players. K. R. and A. I. contain no definite ruling as to the legality
or otherwise of the game, but a Court-Martial would probably trip an
unlucky player on “conduct to the prejudice,” etc.

In civil life (and plain clothes) it is most unusual to be able to
score these specimens, hence the different values of Rear-Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, etc., is not given, nor those of the various branches of
the Service, Executive, Engineer, and the like.




B.

IS A BALD-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Bald-King-Beaver]

That depicted is a magnificent specimen in full winter-coat.

They are not common, but occur frequently--the apparent paradox is
explained by the fact that they are usually of an extremely retiring
nature, and reside by choice in coigns and nooks.

For a specimen such as that mounted game should be claimed and nothing
under three points accepted; rather call off the match and communicate
with the Association.

In scoring really fine specimens in full winter-coat extra points can,
and should be, claimed for purity of tint, bushiness, etc.




C.

IS A CENTAUR-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Centaur-King-Beaver]

There is no record of a specimen being scored. Probably the last
person to do so may have been Jason. The best authorities assume this,
adducing as contributory evidence his later, passionate quest of the
Golden Fleece. Ourselves we regard it as more likely that Chiron was
never scored, Jason being held back by the natural delicacy of one
_in statu pupillari_. In fact, Chiron was, almost certainly, a “local
double-fault.”




D.

IS A DOUBLE-FAULT.


[Illustration: Double-Fault]

This question is dealt with in the terminal essay.

The specimen is a good one, and no player who is deceived by a growth
of this kind need feel the smallest depression. It is the kind of thing
that might happen to anyone.

A young specimen, darker than dark brindle, has, I believe, never been
scored.




E.

IS AN ECCLESIASTICAL-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Ecclesiastical-King-Beaver]

Rare in general, there are frequently to be found in Cathedral cities
large coveys, not very strong on the wing.

Local rules should be consulted as to the scoring. Fine specimens count
at least three points.

I myself, recently, claimed an Ecclesiastical-King, in a country town,
and was awarded two games for it; a well-known local rarity of which
the place is justly proud.

It was a superb specimen, in good coat, a darkish brindle, and in
official robes.




F.

IS A FRINGED-GEORGIC-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Fringed-Georgic-Beaver]

The species is less common than formerly. Some purists refuse to score
these Fringed-Georgics on the plea that the upper lip is bare and the
_chin_ partially bare and that they are, therefore, double-faults. The
general ruling is that as the adornment _circumnavigates_ the face the
chin is not bare, the bareness of the upper lip is immaterial and the
specimen should be scored; one point in the country, three points in
London.




G.

IS A GALLIC-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration Gallic-King-Beaver]

The game is almost unplayable in France. Owing to the superabundance of
specimens only rarities should be scored.

A report has just been received from Cap D’Antibes of a “magnificent
Wasp-Waisted-King.” Game was called. No information was sent
(correspondents are deplorably slack) as to colour or coat.

Good players, in France, lay great stress on minute differences in
colour and characteristic, _i.e._, crimped, curled, waved, rat-tail,
wuzzy, wild-garden, etc.




H.

IS A HALF-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Half-Beaver]

These delightful specimens are now, unhappily, becoming very rare.

They are still occasionally scored in the neighbourhood of places of
worship and on the seashore.

Some claim increased points in ratio to the length of the upper lip.

The specimen mounted (Stockton-on-Tees, 1919), is a fine one,
exhibiting all the marked features of the _genus_, including a most
gratifying labial expanse.




I.

IS AN IMPERIAL-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Imperial-Beaver]

Not common in England; when scored in this country are almost
invariably migrants.

These amusing specimens are, curiously enough, commoner in winter-coat
than in ordinary plumage.

There are no tricks about scoring an Imperial. Any specimen with
moustache and a growth beneath the lower lip, of which the parent area
does not extend to the lower edge of the chin, is an Imperial.

Score three points for a Full-Black; one point for a White.




J.

IS A JOO BEAVER.


[Illustration: Joo Beaver]

These exotics are fairly common, and local sportsmen can be relied
upon to flush a few on short notice, provided that they are allowed to
choose the beat.

In many ways curiously attractive, the charm of the species is marred
by the frequent lack of neatness of plumage; as a race they incline to
landscape-gardening with their hirsuteness.

Carefully note their musical cry of “Oy-Yoy ... Oy Yoy.” A specimen in
full song, when the moon is full, counts game.

Some experts have a very nice scale--by which they score--of the
curvilinear bill. This is a pretty point and a pleasant _raffinement_,
but too subtle for the ordinary week-end player. Of course any
unusually fine frontal curve should be claimed and scored as a rarity.




K.

IS A KILLINGWORTH-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Killingworth-Beaver]

This specimen is mounted for instructional purposes only. Connoisseurs
and collectors are, of course, entirely _au fait_ with the
deliciousness of this gorgeous creature.

George Killingworth, in the year 1555, was sent to the court of Ivan
the Terrible (one of the many monarchs who have, from time to time,
taxed Beavers) as the agent of Queen Mary. His beard was five feet
two inches in length and it was yellow. He was without doubt the most
flawless specimen of a Yellow-King ever seen.

It is considered in the highest degree unlikely that anything
approaching this efflorescence will be noted nowadays, hence no score
is suggested.




L.

IS A LICKED-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Licked-Beaver]

It is worthy of remark in passing that this distinguishing title is due
to the genius of a child--“trailing clouds,” etc.--who, on observing
the first specimen ever scored, cried, “Oh, look; he’s licked it.”

The species is very rare. Off-shoots of the old stock, in the form
of Semi-Walruses, are occasionally observed, but the Licked-Beaver
is generally regarded as almost extinct. Possibly the cause of this
diminution, if not extinction, may be the increase in the cost of
living.

The specimen mounted is a very fine one. Should a player have the good
fortune to score a Licked-Beaver, let him remember that it is the
density of the licking, the spear-form, the sharpness, that should be
regarded rather than the length of the portion licked.




M.

IS A MANDARIN-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Mandarin-Beaver]

Even in plain clothes should score two games if seen in England. There
is no ruling as to the points to be scored if observed in this country
in full plumage.

This specimen is often wrongly catalogued in books of reference as a
Mandarin-King-Beaver. Royalty or Kinghood is impossible for a species
which supports a very notable gap between its central adornment and the
maxillary-fringes.

The specimen mounted is, so to say, traditional, that is, it is a
transcript of an early-nineteenth century Chinese brush-drawing on silk
in Chinese ink representing a hero, or as we should say, a Beaver.




N.

IS A NANNY-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Nanny-Beaver]

Really good specimens are very rare. They are reported to flourish in
the Eastern farming states of the United States of America, but British
research is lamentably behindhand, and our exact knowledge is quite
fragmentary.

In any case there is one simple rule for the guidance of the _amateur_;
no Nanny-Beaver can be claimed or scored of which the adornment does
not depend a full two inches from the under-surface of the chin.




O.

IS AN ORIENTAL-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Oriental-Beaver]

These strangely beautiful specimens are rarely seen in this cold
country.

Those who have had the privilege of observing closely a gaggle of
Orientals in indigenous plumage (the species is pathetically subject to
local changes) will, assuredly, ever prize the recollection.

The most noteworthy feature, apart from the extraordinarily fine
quality of coat (glossiness, sheen, etc.), is the exotic parting
which lends a wistful charm to the otherwise opulent glories of these
occasional visitors.

Score always two games (in England); set, if the specimen is in
indigenous plumage.




P.

IS A PARTI-COLOUR-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Parti-Colour-Beaver]

These specimens are curiously attractive and are more often scored than
one would think. Artists, above all others, wax well-nigh lyrical over
the beauties of a well-defined Parti-Colour, one, that is, in which
there is almost no shading, the black being black and the white, white.
The same colouration is observed in the pelt of the Colobus monkey and
justly admired.

It is not possible to distinguish between natural and artificial
Parti-Colours, unless one should happen to be a relative of the
specimen. All Parti-Colours are, therefore, scored. (Two points.)




Q.

IS A QUEEN-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Queen-Beaver]

It has been objected that it is not gallant to score these undoubted
rarities. Theoretically it is, certainly, not pretty conduct, but, on
the other hand, all is fair in love and war, and ... has any man ever
refused to shoot a rhinoceros on the plea that it was a female? (I
merely ask ... someone may have done so. There may even be a close time
for doe-rhinoes.) Be that as it may, the scoring of Queens is an affair
of lineage. Regard this eighteenth century distich:--

    “Here is a Pink-Queen, very rare,
    Remember to count the sixteenth hair.”[1]

Queens are always scored extravagantly. Usually game; extra-rarities
two games, and so on. The Pink-Queen is, without doubt, the rarest of
her kind; conversely, when found, she is usually a superb specimen, in
rich coat. The question of Queens is dealt with broadly in the terminal
essay.

[Footnote 1: Queens cannot be scored unless they have _more_ than
fifteen hairs.]




R.

IS A RED-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Red-King-Beaver]

I feel a very natural emotion on commenting on the sublime specimen
of the Red-King, the ultimate hope of every keen collector, which
is portrayed on the opposite page. Observed outside “The Goose and
Gridiron,” in Slogsby-under-Hill, this noble creature deprived both my
companion (an ex-local champion) and myself of speech for three minutes.

Had he been carrying a ladder (the _ne-plus-ultra_ of Beaverhood) we
had never recovered from the glory of the revelation.

Red-Kings score “Game, set, match.” A Red-King on a green bicycle,
carrying a lanthorn (or lantern), scores do. do. “Local Championship.”
A Red-King on a green bicycle carrying a ladder (poor old Pelion!) has
never, alas! been reported up to the present.

There are dreams of scoring a Red-King, complete with fitments, on a
High Bicycle ... all things are possible, even a ravishment such as
that.




S.

IS A SANTA-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Santa-Beaver]

These are usually scored, though your conscientious expert demurs at so
doing, as it has been held--and the view is well supported by players
of repute--that they are strictly-speaking Double-Faults, the adornment
being temporary.

The genuine Santa-King-Beaver, complete with reindeer, sleigh and
business with chimney, has never, I believe, been scored.

Claim a game if you, a stranger adult, score one.




T.

IS A TUFTED-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Tufted-King-Beaver]

It may, perhaps, be thought that this is a fanciful, a pernickety
differentiation--such are to be deplored--but there is a very
distinct species of Beaver--King or ordinary--having these marked
characteristics, and the best players invariably claim a Tufted, and
two points, if they have the luck to espy a specimen such as that
depicted.

The points to look for are the three patches of foliage in centre
forehead and over either ear. The chin-growth partakes of the nature of
these, but it is the _tufted temple_ which makes your rarity.

In the last century this sub-branch of the genus Longi-Florum was
fairly common; sub-title, Adolphus.




U.

IS AN URSINE-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Ursine-Beaver]

The specimen mounted is, I believe, unique. A noted scientist in
private life, in public life an exquisite Ursine--or (as some say)
Leonine--there are no _data_ extant to assist us in forming an opinion
as to why he did it.

It is scarcely likely that this phenomenon will flower again for
centuries. Should a pale reflection be observed, remember that the
salient points are: (a.) great width across the cheek-bones, (b.)
uniformity of foliage.

The miracle mounted opposite had tendrils, delicate, wonderful, almost
on the lower edge of the eye-lids.

The osseous formation of the nasal promonotory should be carefully
studied by earnest _amateurs_.




V.

IS A VAN DYCK-BEAVER.


[Illustration Van Dyck-Beaver]

Mounted as an historical curiosity: they are now extinct.

In full bloom they were, I am told, very beautiful. The finest
specimens had _never_ shaved, hence the coat was a miracle of gloss,
softness, shimmer and silk.

Should anything, _anything_ approaching this shape be observed, kindly
write at once to the Association, who are only too anxious to catalogue
every rarity.

Disregard cropped hair. One dare not hope for a modern specimen in
trailing-coat.




W.

IS A WALRUS.


[Illustration: Walrus]

These cannot be scored when playing Beaver.

A debased form of the game called “Walrus” is--actually--played, and,
occasionally, mixed Walrus and Beaver. The Walrus game usually ends in
an unseemly wrangle, owing to the intense difficulty in deciding on the
exact status of the specimen.

The specimen mounted is almost perfect--perhaps it is a thought
regular--it was observed in 1922 in Knightsbridge; the neat bow-tie was
pale blue satin, almost certainly attached by a brass clip.




X.

IS A XANTHINE-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Xanthine-King-Beaver]

These specimens are only scored by specialists.

There is a perfectly distinct difference between a Xanthine, a Red
and a Yellow, but it is very small, and to mark it requires a very
nicely-trained eye. Xanthines are usually rather bewildered-looking,
and are remarkable, in general, for profusion of crop and coarseness of
coat.

The habit of insisting on minute colour-niceties is to be deplored as
tending to debase the sport to the level of the philatelist’s “rose-red
on carmine,” “carmine on rose-red.”




Y.

IS A YELLOW-KING.


[Illustration: Yellow-King]

Excessively rare.

With the exception of George Killingworth, cited on page 25, the
most notable Yellow-King of whom we have record is Leo Vincey, the
superlative Beaver who went, in company with his dark-brindle guardian,
Mr. Holly, in search of “She” ... or should it be “Her”?

There is no record in office of a Yellow-King having been scored in the
last eleven years. They are seen occasionally in France, and there are
vague rumours that a certain number are bagged yearly in Germany.

Claim extravagant points if you have the fortune to light upon one.
Here again sheen is most important, and the coat should be fine, soft
and silky.




Z.

IS A ZEBRA-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Zebra-King-Beaver]

Excessively rare.

I, myself, have once scored a Zebra-King, but it was, and is, the only
specimen of which I have heard, and it is greatly prized locally.

The colour-demarcation must be very obvious before one can claim a
Zebra. There is as much difference between a Yellow and a Red-King as
there is between a Zebra and a Brindle.

The King illustrated is--I speak without fear of being
contradicted--literally unique. In superb coat, ideal shape of
attachment, in colour--a greenish tabby with dark markings, the Zebra
I have the pleasure of showing you represents the _ne-plus-ultra_ of
rarity.

He thus forms a fitting, as it were, _cul-de-lampe_ to my “littel”
guide.




TERMINAL ESSAY ON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF BEAVERING MEN.


Proem.

Adam, according to tradition, was created in full King-Beaverhood, and,
burgeoning amid the bougainvillea and borage of the Garden of Eden,
the Beard, throughout the centuries, has bloomed and faded, resurged,
again faded, then blossomed anew that, in the fullness of time, the
Beard-Bearer might be crowned with the honourable title of Beaver.
“The soft susurrus of his silken stride” brings joy to the heart of
man, perhaps also “game, set, match,” and the shape, the colour, the
texture of his adornment provoke a fastidious scrutiny akin to that of
a connoisseur appraising a Crown Derby figurine. For many years the
auburn-haired hero who grew a beard was not, _ipso facto_, a person of
any importance. A dignitary of the Church, whose venerable features
were complemented or obscured by a snowy, a grizzled or a brindled
beard of majestic length, was not, inherently, remarkable. Behold them
now, a Red-King and an Ecclesiastical King, cynosures, orchids upon
the unlovely tree-trunk of our common life. As the poet might have
written:--

    Beaver, beaver, burning bright,
    In what forest of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
    Could frame thy xanthine symmetry?


The Beaver in History.

The celebrated Beavers of history need not be catalogued at length.
Shakespeare was a Bald-Beaver, apparently an Anticipatory-Vandyke.
Napoleon Bonaparte was not a Beaver. Julius Cæsar, Edward Gibbon, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Alexander VI. and Beethoven did all “... against the
edicts of God, the oracles of the Prophets, the placits of councils
and the judgment of learned men, hold fast the foolish custom of
shaving.”[2] Contrariwise, Hannibal, William Morris, Rodin, St.
Paul and Juan Rodriguez de Silva z Vélasquez were all content with
“nourishing their horrid bushes of vanity.”[3] The Jews bore their
beards proudly from out the Captivity. Indeed they took captivity
captive; did not the Egyptians from time to time, asserting their
masculinity, assume ceremonial false beards, “double faults” to a man?
The most antient Romans were King-Beavers; the Normans were Walruses;
the Greeks supported a considerable number of King-Beavers, among them
Pericles and Socrates, “shaving was very rare in the early part of our
period (440 B.C.–330 B.C.).”[4] Until the eighteenth century Beaverhood
was common, since that time it has grown rarer and rarer, with a sudden
uprush of fur to the face in the middle of the last century, an uprush
which has now almost died away. We read “... the value of their fur
has caused their destruction in great measure where they were once
numerous, and has led to their extirpation where there is evidence that
they existed as a not uncommon animal. They were formerly distributed
over the greater part of Europe. In England semi-fossilised remains
show that they were not uncommon ... in 1188 Giraldus stated that they
were living on the river Teify in Cardiganshire ... some were known to
frequent the Elbe in 1878.”[5]

[Footnote 2: Bulwer. _Anthropometamorphosis_ (1650).]

[Footnote 3: Dr. Bolton.]

[Footnote 4: Tucker, _Life in Ancient Athens_, p. 83.]

[Footnote 5: _Living Animals of the World_, vol. I., p. 152 _et seq._
_Parts of this extract are not clear. What value has the pelt of the
Red-King commercially? Can a tippet be made of the adornment of the
Fringed-Georgic?_]


THE GAME.

Origin.

The origin of the game, which is scored in exactly the same manner as
Lawn Tennis, is unknown. There are, however, various theories; one
school holds that it came to birth in Oxford, another that it emerged
in the other place, and a third traces it to Malta (where “my brother
from Gozo” was, doubtless, a local champion) and seeks for some
association with antient mysteries.

The outlines of the game itself are so simple and well-defined that the
question of rules scarcely arises. A bearded man is a Beaver, claim
him, crying aloud, as musically as possible, “Beaver, fifteen love”--or
appropriately to the score. If both players cry aloud simultaneously it
is a “no-ball.”


Double Faults.

The system of “double faults” deserves explanation. The educational
value of the game is high, fostering as it does quickness of
observation and that desirable attribute, an eagle-glance. When a
player has had some little practice he will often score winning points
from behind the specimen. Thus a side-whiskered gentleman may be
claimed from the rear but, on drawing level with the quarry, it is
observed that the chin is bare ... double fault.


Local Double Faults.

“Local double faults” are always a matter of courtesy, and if one
claims a “local D. F.” one is not mulcted in the point. Usually it
is some revered and Friend-of-all-the-World Beaver who is created,
by general consent, a “local D. F.,” to enable players to discuss,
unembarrassed, the day’s sport with him. Juvenile players find this
convention of the greatest possible service. Hot-tempered, hard-handed
uncles and such like are swiftly appeased by being made “local D. F.s,”
and join whole-heartedly in the triumph occasioned by the capture of
some other Brindled-King.


Status of Beaver.

It has been mentioned in the notes that very high standards have been
from time to time set up as regards the status of Beaver. Passionate
purists have, indeed, claimed that the charming Half-Beaver is a D. F.,
that the delicate wilding, the Fringed-Georgic, is a D. F., even that
the Imperial and the Nanny are suspect. Heed not such persons. Remember
Knut and Mrs. Partington, nor seek to gild the lily. The sign manual
of the Beaver is the not-naked chin, ἂγυμνος. No one of the specimens
mentioned above has a naked chin, therefore, they are all Beavers;
_quod erat demonstrandum_.


Hints as to Habitat.

The game can be played anywhere, except in Burithabeth, for “these men
have no beards at all, for we saw them carry a certain iron instrument
in their hands wherewith, if any hairs grow upon their chin, they
presently pluck them out.”[6] Cathedral cities are a favourite habitat
of the _genus_, and some are always to be found in the neighbourhood
of Pall Mall. Dockyard towns provide large numbers of the ordinary
variety, but very few Kings.

[Footnote 6: Mandeville.]


Single-handed Beaver.

It is not generally known that a rigidly conscientious person can play
single-handed Beaver with great content. One scores Beavers walking in
the same direction as oneself to the server, Beavers coming from that
direction, and so passing the player, to the striker and stationary
Beavers in accordance with the direction in which their heads are
turned, towards or away from the player. Beavers debouching suddenly
from cross-roads, if one has not time, as on a swift omnibus, to
observe their ultimate direction, are “no-balls.”


Objections to the Game.

It has been objected that the game is nonsensical, anti-social and
essentially discourteous. Nonsensical it is, an it please you; but
is not nonsense a rare and a precious thing? Is not the nonsense of
Lewis Carroll quite entirely adorable? Is not Lear’s story of Violet,
Slingsby, Guy and Lionel a thing of impressive beauty? The game is not
anti-social, for it entails an increased interest in and admiration of
one’s fellow-men and, as regards discourtesy, surely it is as much a
compliment to a Red-King to cry on him, “Beaver, game, set, match,” as
it is to comment upon some damsel’s handsome eyes.


The Beaver.

“Aristotle in his ethics takes up the conceit of the _Bever_,”[7]
and, in general, one may assume that the bearded are proud of their
adornments, love them, cherish them, even going so far in some cases
as to enclose them in silken bags before retiring to rest. Controversy
has long raged as to the propriety or otherwise of shaving. The Greek
Church held strong views on the point, “... and also they say, that
we sin deadly in shaving our beards, for the beard is token of a man,
and gift of our Lord.”[8] The antient Greeks, as we have observed, for
long clutched their hairiness, but finally succumbed to the Macedonian
mode, and shaved clean; it is an interesting point that they did
utterly abhor the Walrus. In England the matter has been entirely
regulated by fashion, and I cannot trace the existence of any important
body of opinion in favour of or against the practice of shaving. It
would, nevertheless, be safe to say that an immature Beaver in the
present year of grace is so rare as to be practically unknown--English
specimens are seldom lighter than medium-brindle--which shows the trend
of modern thought.

It may be accepted, then, that the Beaver indulges in efflorescence in
order to gratify his vanity (or in a few cases, perhaps, to keep his
throat warm and save the expense of cravats). Perhaps he remembers the
dictum, “_l’habit long et la barbe imposent de respect_.”[9] In which
connection it may be emphasised that the intense interest now taken in
fine specimens should be (and probably is) a source of considerable
gratification to them. I have even been told of one superb Red-King who
invariably congratulates the fortunate player who scores him.

[Footnote 7: Browne. _Pseudodoxia_, I., c. ix.]

[Footnote 8: Mandeville, c. iii.]

[Footnote 9: Voltaire, _Dict. Phil._]


Characteristics of various Species.

It is interesting to observe the very marked personal characteristics
of the various species. A Brindled-King-Beaver is commonly
distinguished by a dignified port and an air of profound weightiness.
In a Red-King something of wistful may be remarked, in a Xanthine
a touch, maybe, of bewilderment. Parti-colours are usually rather
bird-like (perhaps the unconscious influence of the wag-tail) and
Yellows are always pugnacious in appearance. The Fringed-Georgic smacks
of the soil, the Imperial of cafés with red velvet, the Bald-King of
the Reading-Room of the British Museum, the Tufted of antimaccassars
and bronze horrors wriggling under glass domes. But all, without
exception, carry an indefinable air of _exotisme_, a something that
raises them above the herd; they appear never natural products, always
“sports.”


The Queen-Beaver.

Of the Queen-Beaver it may be safely said that “the female of the
species is more deadly than the male.” A really fine Pink-Queen is
awe-inspiring, and a Grey-Queen infinitely terrifying. The dainty
Blonde-Queen (it is advisable to have two assessors, for the signs of
her beaverhood are “_plus follets, plus doux, plus imperceptibles_”[10]
than in any other species) has a sinister air; a Black-Queen suggests
“Macbeth.” It is curious to read that “in Cyprus the Goddess of Love
wore a beard.”[11] Queens are rare and no false gallantry should prevent
a player from scoring them whenever possible. It is, however, the mark
of the gentleman to claim them _sotto voce_, almost in a whisper.

[Footnote 10: Voltaire, _op. cit._]

[Footnote 11: Macrobius, _Saturn_, iii., 8.2.]


Personalia.

We have now examined the game briefly, investigated the
characteristics of the Beaver family, cast a rapid and perfunctory
glance at the Beaver in History (a subject deserving of a tome), and
suggested explanations that may be offered, a defence that may be
attempted, when a player is assailed by a non-player. “To beaver or not
to beaver, that is the question.” The decision must be taken; paltering
is no part of a man. Myself, I took it on the top of an omnibus outside
the Ritz, and I played a most excellent game with myself as far as St.
Mary Abbott’s.

Having set my hand to the plough I did not look back, but entered upon
the game in all seriousness. When Fortune appeared I did not give her
a chance to “present her bald noddle,” but I grabbed her firmly by the
forelock. Being from town I chanced upon a small _coterie_ of learned
enthusiasts, and much improved my game, as also my knowledge. The city
was a very warren of Beavers; most of my finest specimens were secured
there. Does not the mouth of every collector water on reading that I
scored--with two witnesses, one of whom viséd the prey--a glorious
Pink-Queen, leaning on a green bicycle outside the Post-Office? and,
subsequently, an American Grey-Queen with young? The only rarity,
roughly speaking, which eluded me was a fine Fringed-Georgic. I scored
a somewhat moth-eaten specimen of uncertain colouration. Thus, “on
stepping-stones of our dead” Beavers I attained to a certain skill.
It would have been impossible to choose a better place for my little
holiday, and my gratitude to my genial instructors and coaches knows no
bounds.

Local rules were well-framed, simple and reasonable. There are two
“local D. F.s,” easily recognisable, and a certain number of markedly
fine specimens which have great repute in the district and bear a
very high scoring-value. All unknowing I claimed and scored _the_
Ecclesiastical-King and was, instantly, awarded two games. It was, in
very truth, a noble creature, a Pointed-Brindle, which is, of course,
as rare and valuable as a pointed fox, in gorgeous coat and official
robes of a searching scarlet. I had the good fortune to secure also the
finest King in Full Winter-Coat that I have ever seen. The adornment
was almost incredibly bushy and “white as the neck of Lalage,” while
the specimen wore brown _suéde_ shoes. Heigh ho! for the brave days
that are dead. Golly, what a garland I wove me in that dear place.


Conclusion.

To what point are we come? Is the game of Beaver the expression of
a passionate mass-protest against the furred face, or is it the
forerunner of a revival of beards, that is, do we see here the shadow
of that antient custom which led peoples to sacrifice yearly the
animals who else were deities, whom they adored?[12] In any case the
Beard is again burgeoning. But a few years gone the bearded were not,
_qua_ beards, of any importance, now they loom upon the social horizon
considerably larger than a man’s hand. Of the importance of the Beard
it may well be that the apogee is upon us. Perchance the Beard will
again be invested with the dignity of ceremonial as in antient China.
“After the coffining,” so we read of the obsequies of an officer, “the
Master of the Ceremonies does away with his hair-tufts.”[13] Shall we
live to see the Beard exalted as an horn on high? Will the game of
Beaver re-instate the Beard as the Crimean campaign instituted the now
almost extinct (but exquisite) moustache-whisker fitment, or will it
drive the hairy to put off the whole armour of hairiness? _Quien sabe?_
These things remain, in the charming phrase of M. Cliché, “on the knees
of the gods,” but it is safe to assert that, even now, we can as a
people, we English, rebut the accusation of Samuel Butler, “we often do
not notice that a man has grown a beard.”[14]

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

I have no pleasure in them;"
012:002 Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
        and the clouds return after the rain;
012:003 in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
        and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders
        cease because they are few, and those who look out of the
        windows are darkened,
012:004 and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound
        of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice
        of a bird, and all the dauvghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his

012:005 yes, they shall be afraid oo cut off those of his who escape.
        Don't deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress.
001:015 For the day of Yahweh is near all the nations!  As you have done,
        it will be done to you.  Your deeds will return upon
        your own head.
001:016 For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations
        drink continually.  Yes, they will drink, swallow down,
        and will be as though they had not been.
001:017 But in Mount Zion, there will be those who escape, and it will
        be holy.  The house of Jacob will possess their possessions.
001:018 The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame,
        and the house of Esau for stubble.  They will burn among them,
        and devour them.  There will not be any remaining to the house
        of Esau."  Indeed, Yahweh has spoken.
001:019 Those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau,
        and those of the lowland, the Philistines.  They will
        possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria.
        Benjamin will possess Gilead.
001:020 The captives of this army of the children of Israel,
        who are among the Canaanites, will possess even to Zarephath;
        and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad,
        will possess the cities of the Negev.
001:021 Saviors will go up on Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau,
        and the kingdom will be Yahweh's.
Book 32 Jonah
001:001 Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
001:002 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it,
        for their wickedness has come up before me."
001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.
        He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish;
        so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them
        to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.
001:004 But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there
        was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the ship was likely
        to break up.
001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god.
        They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea,
        to lighten it.  But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts
        of the ship, and he was laying down, and was fast asleep.
001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, "What do
        you mean, sleeper?  Arise, call on your God{or, gods}!
        Maybe your God{or, gods} will notice us, so that we won't perish."
001:007 They all said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots,
        that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us."
        So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
001:008 Then they asked him, "Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil
        is on us.  What is your occupation?  Where do you come from?
        What is your country?  Of what people are you?"
001:009 He said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God
        of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land."
001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, "What is
        this that you have done?"  For the men knew that he was fleeing
        from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.
001:011 Then said they to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea
        may be calm to us?"  For the sea grew more and more stormy.
001:012 He said to them, "Take me up, and throw me into the sea.
        Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me
        this great storm is on you."
001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land;
        but they could not, for the sea grew more and more
        stormy against them.
001:014 Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, "We beg you,
        Yahweh, we beg you, let us not perish for this man's life,
        and don't lay on us innocent blood; for you, Yahweh, have done
        as it pleased you."
001:015 So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea
        ceased its raging.
001:016 Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered
        a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows.
001:017 Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah
        was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
002:001 Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish's belly.
002:002 He said, "I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.
        He answered me.  Out of the belly of Sheol I cried.
        You heard my voice.
002:003 For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas.
        The flood was all around me.  All your waves and your billows
        passed over me.
002:004 I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look
        again toward your holy temple.'
002:005 The waters surrounded me, even to the soul.  The deep was around me.
        The weeds were wrapped around my head.
002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.  The earth barred
        me in forever:  yet have you brought up my life from the pit,
        Yahweh my God.
002:007 "When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.
        My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.
002:008 Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
002:009 But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
        I will pay that which I have vowed.  Salvation belongs to Yahweh."
002:010 Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
003:001 The word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time, saying,
003:002 "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it
        the message that I give you."
003:003 So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word
        of Yahweh.  Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city,
        three days' journey across.
003:004 Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried out,
        and said, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"
003:005 The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast,
        and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to
        the least of them.
003:006 The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne,
        and took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth,
        and sat in ashes.
003:007 He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the
        decree of the king and his nobles, saying, "Let neither man
        nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed,
        nor drink water;
003:008 but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal,
        and let them cry mightily to God.  Yes, let them turn everyone
        from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.
003:009 Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away
        from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?"
003:010 God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way.
        God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them,
        and he didn't do it.
004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
004:002 He prayed to Yahweh, and said, "Please, Yahweh, wasn't this what I
        said when I was still in my own country?  Therefore I hurried
        to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God,
        and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
        and you relent of doing harm.
004:003 Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me;
        for it is better for me to die than to live."
004:004 Yahweh said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
004:005 Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city,
        and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade,
        until he might see what would become of the city.
004:006 Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah,
        that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him
        from his discomfort.  So Jonah was exceedingly glad because
        of the vine.
004:007 But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed
        on the vine, so that it withered.
004:008 It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry
        east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah's head, so that he fainted,
        and requested for himself that he might die, and said,
        "It is better for me to die than to live."
004:009 God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?"
        He said, "I am right to be angry, even to death."
004:010 Yahweh said, "You have been concerned for the vine,
        for which you have not labored, neither made it grow;
        which came up in a night, and perished in a night.
004:011 Shouldn't I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city,
        in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons
        who can't discern between their right hand and their left hand;
        and also much livestock?"
Book 33 Micah
001:001 The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days
        of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw
        concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
001:002 Hear, you peoples, all of you.  Listen, O earth, and all that
        is therein:  and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,
        the Lord from his holy temple.
001:003 For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place, and will come
        down and tread on the high places of the earth.
001:004 The mountains melt under him, and the valleys split apart,
        like wax before the fire, like waters that are poured down
        a steep place.
001:005 "All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, and for the sins
        of the house of Israel.  What is the disobedience
        of Jacob?  Isn't it Samaria?  And what are the high places
        of Judah?  Aren't they Jerusalem?
001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,
        like places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down its
        stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations.
001:007 All her idols will be beaten to pieces, and all her temple gifts
        will be burned with fire, and all her images I will destroy;
        for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,
        and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return."
001:008 For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked;
        I will howl like the jackals, and moan like the daughters of owls.
001:009 For her wounds are incurable; for it has come even to Judah.
        It reaches to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
001:010 Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't weep at all.  At Beth Ophrah{Beth Ophrah
        means literally "House of Dust."} I have rolled myself
        in the dust.
001:011 Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.
        The inhabitant of Zaanan won't come out.  The wailing
        of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.
001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,
        because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.
001:013 Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.
        She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; For the
        transgressions of Israel were found in you.
001:014 Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.
        The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the
        kings of Israel.
001:015 I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah.
        He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
001:016 Shave your heads, and cut off your hair for the children
        of your delight.  Enlarge your baldness like the vulture;
        for they have gone into captivity from you!
002:001 Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds!
        When the morning is light, they practice it, because it
        is in the power of their hand.
002:002 They covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away:
        and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
002:003 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  "Behold, I am planning against these
        people a disaster, from which you will not remove your necks,
        neither will you walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
002:004 In that day they will take up a parable against you, and lament
        with a doleful lamentation, saying, 'We are utterly ruined!
        My people's possession is divided up.  Indeed he takes it
        from me and assigns our fields to traitors!'"
002:005 Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot
        in the assembly of Yahweh.
002:006 "Don't prophesy!"  They prophesy.  "Don't prophesy about
        these things.  Disgrace won't overtake us."
002:007 Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:  "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?
        Are these his doings?  Don't my words do good to him
        who walks blamelessly?"
002:008 But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.  You strip
        the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care,
        returning from battle.
002:009 You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;
        from their young children you take away my blessing forever.
002:010 Arise, and depart!  For this is not your resting place, because of
        uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.
002:011 If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:
        "I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;"
        he would be the prophet of this people.
002:012 I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather
        the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep
        of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture;
        they will swarm with people.
002:013 He who breaks open the way goes up before them.
        They break through the gate, and go out.  And their king
        passes on before them, with Yahweh at their head.
003:001 I said, "Please listen, you heads of Jacob, and rulers
        of the house of Israel:  Isn't it for you to know justice?
003:002 You who hate the good, and love the evil; who tear off their skin,
        and their flesh from off their bones;
003:003 who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
        off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
        as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
003:004 Then they will cry to Yahweh, but he will not answer them.
        Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, because they
        made their deeds evil."
003:005 Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray;
        for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, "Peace!"
        and whoever doesn't provide for their mouths, they prepare
        war against him:
003:006 "Therefore night is over you, with no vision, and it is dark
        to you, that you may not divine; and the sun will go down on
        the prophets, and the day will be black over them.
003:007 The seers shall be disappointed, and the diviners confounded.
        Yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no
        answer from God."
003:008 But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh,
        and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his disobedience,
        and to Israel his sin.
003:009 Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,
        and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice,
        and pervert all equity.
003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
003:011 Her leaders judge for bribes, and her priests teach for a price,
        and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:  yet they
        lean on Yahweh, and say, "Isn't Yahweh in the midst of us?
        No disaster will come on us."
003:012 Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,
        and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, and the mountain
        of the temple like the high places of a forest.
004:001 But in the latter days, it will happen that the mountain of
        Yahweh's temple will be established on the top of the mountains,
        and it will be exalted above the hills; and peoples will
        stream to it.
004:002 Many nations will go and say, "Come, and let us go up to
        the mountain of Yahweh, and to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths."
        For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of
        Yahweh from Jerusalem;
004:003 and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide
        concerning strong nations afar off.  They will beat their
        swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.
        Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will
        they learn war any more.
004:004 But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
        and no one will make them afraid:  For the mouth of Yahweh
        of Armies has spoken.
004:005 Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;
        but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
004:006 "In that day," says Yahweh, "I will assemble that which is lame,
        and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which
        I have afflicted;
004:007 and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which
        was cast far off a strong nation:  and Yahweh will reign
        over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever."
004:008 You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
        to you it will come, yes, the former dominion will come,
        the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
004:009 Now why do you cry out aloud?  Is there no king in you?
        Has your counselor perished, that pains have taken hold of you
        as of a woman in travail?
004:010 Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, daughter of Zion, like a
        woman in travail; for now you will go forth out of the city,
        and will dwell in the field, and will come even to Babylon.
        There you will be rescued.  There Yahweh will redeem you
        from the hand of your enemies.
004:011 Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,
        "Let her be defiled, and let our eye gloat over Zion."
004:012 But they don't know the thoughts of Yahweh, neither do they
        understand his counsel; for he has gathered them like the sheaves
        to the threshing floor.
004:013 Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; for I will make your horn iron,
        and I will make your hoofs brass; and you will beat in pieces
        many peoples:  and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,
        and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
005:001 Now you shall gather yourself in troops, daughter of troops.
        He has laid siege against us.  They will strike the judge
        of Israel with a rod on the cheek.
005:002 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, being small among the clans of Judah,
        out of you one will come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel;
        whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
005:003 Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is
        in labor gives birth.  Then the rest of his brothers will
        return to the children of Israel.
005:004 He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength
        of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:
        and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends
        of the earth.
005:005 He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,
        and when he marches through our fortresses, then we will raise
        against him seven shepherds, and eight leaders of men.
005:006 They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land
        of Nimrod in its gates.  He will deliver us from the Assyrian,
        when he invades our land, and when he marches within our border.
005:007 The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples,
        like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass, that don't
        wait for man, nor wait for the sons of men.
005:008 The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst
        of many peoples, like a lion among the animals of the forest,
        like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he
        goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there
        is no one to deliver.
005:009 Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, and let
        all of your enemies be cut off.
005:010 "It will happen in that day," says Yahweh, "That I will
        cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will
        destroy your chariots.
005:011 I will cut off the cities of your land, and will tear down
        all your strongholds.
005:012 I will destroy witchcraft from your hand; and you shall
        have no soothsayers.
005:013 I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out
        of your midst; and you shall no more worship the work
        of your hands.
005:014 I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst; and I will
        destroy your cities.
005:015 I will execute vengeance in anger, and wrath on the nations
        that didn't listen."
006:001 Listen now to what Yahweh says:  "Arise, plead your case before
        the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say.
006:002 Hear, you mountains, Yahweh's controversy, and you enduring
        foundations of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy
        with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
006:003 My people, what have I done to you?  How have I burdened you?
        Answer me!
006:004 For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        you out of the house of bondage.  I sent before you
        Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
006:005 My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,
        and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim
        to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh."
006:006 How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the
        exalted God?  Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
        with calves a year old?
006:007 Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams?  With tens of thousands
        of rivers of oil?  Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?
        The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
006:008 He has shown you, O man, what is good.  What does Yahweh require
        of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
        with your God?
006:009 Yahweh's voice calls to the city, and wisdom sees your name:
        "Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it.
006:010 Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
        and a short ephah{An ephah is a measure of volume, and a short
        ephah is made smaller than a full ephah for the purpose
        of cheating customers.} that is accursed?
006:011 Shall I be pure with dishonest scales, and with a bag
        of deceitful weights?
006:012 Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies,
        and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.
006:013 Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound.
        I have made you desolate because of your sins.
006:014 You shall eat, but not be satisfied.  Your humiliation
        will be in your midst.  You will store up, but not save;
        and that which you save I will give up to the sword.
006:015 You will sow, but won't reap.  You will tread the olives,
        but won't anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes,
        but won't drink the wine.
006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house
        of Ahab.  You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin,
        and her inhabitants a hissing; And you will bear the reproach
        of my people."
007:001 Misery is mine!  Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits,
        as gleanings of the vineyard:  There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
        My soul desires to eat the early fig.
007:002 The godly man has perished out of the earth, and there is
        no one upright among men.  They all lie in wait for blood;
        every man hunts his brother with a net.
007:003 Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.
        The ruler and judge ask for a bribe; and the powerful man dictates
        the evil desire of his soul.  Thus they conspire together.
007:004 The best of them is like a brier.  The most upright is worse than
        a thorn hedge.  The day of your watchmen, even your visitation,
        has come; now is the time of their confusion.
007:005 Don't trust in a neighbor.  Don't put confidence in a friend.
        With the woman lying in your embrace, be careful of the words
        of your mouth!
007:006 For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against
        her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
        a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
007:007 But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.  I will wait for the God
        of my salvation.  My God will hear me.
007:008 Don't rejoice against me, my enemy.  When I fall, I will arise.
        When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.
007:009 I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have
        sinned against him, until he pleads my case, and executes
        judgment for me.  He will bring me forth to the light.
        I will see his righteousness.
007:010 Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me,
        where is Yahweh your God?  Then my enemy will see me and will
        cover her shame.  Now she will be trodden down like the mire
        of the streets.
007:011 A day to build your walls--In that day, he will extend your boundary.
007:012 In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities
        of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea,
        and mountain to mountain.
007:013 Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,
        for the fruit of their doings.
007:014 Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your heritage,
        who dwell by themselves in a forest, in the midst of
        fertile pasture land, let them feed; in Bashan and Gilead,
        as in the days of old.
007:015 "As in the days of your coming forth out of the land
        of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things."
007:016 The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.
        They will lay their hand on their mouth.  Their ears
        will be deaf.
007:017 They will lick the dust like a serpent.  Like crawling things
        of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.
        They will come with fear to Yahweh our God, and will be afraid
        because of you.
007:018 Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, and passes
        over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?
        He doesn't retain his anger forever, because he delights
        in loving kindness.
007:019 He will again have compassion on us.  He will tread our iniquities
        under foot; and you will cast all their sins into the depths
        of the sea.
007:020 You will give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham, as you
        have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
Book 34 Nahum
001:001 An oracle about Nineveh.  The book of the vision of
        Nahum the Elkoshite.
001:002 Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges.  Yahweh avenges and is
        full of wrath.  Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries,
        and he maintains wrath against his enemies.
001:003 Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no
        means leave the guilty unpunished.  Yahweh has his way in
        the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust
        of his feet.
001:004 He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers.
        Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.
001:005 The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away.
        The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all
        who dwell in it.
001:006 Who can stand before his indignation?  Who can endure the
        fierceness of his anger?  His wrath is poured out like fire,
        and the rocks are broken apart by him.
001:007 Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble;
        and he knows those who take refuge in him.
001:008 But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place,
        and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
001:009 What do you plot against Yahweh?  He will make a full end.
        Affliction won't rise up the second time.
001:010 For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink,
        they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.
001:011 There is one gone forth out of you, who devises evil against Yahweh,
        who counsels wickedness.
001:012 Thus says Yahweh:  "Though they be in full strength, and likewise
        many, even so they will be cut down, and he shall pass away.
        Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
001:013 Now will I break his yoke from off you, and will burst
        your bonds apart."
001:014 Yahweh has commanded concerning you:  "No more descendants
        will bear your name.  Out of the house of your gods,
        will I cut off the engraved image and the molten image.
        I will make your grave, for you are vile."
001:015 Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news,
        who publishes peace!  Keep your feasts, Judah!  Perform your vows,
        for the wicked one will no more pass through you.
        He is utterly cut off.
002:001 He who dashes in pieces has come up against you.
        Keep the fortress!  Watch the way!  Strengthen your waist!
        Fortify your power mightily!
002:002 For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency
        of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed them, and ruined
        their vine branches.
002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red.  The valiant men
        are in scarlet.  The chariots flash with steel in the day
        of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.
002:004 The chariots rage in the streets.  They rush back and forth
        in the broad ways.  Their appearance is like torches.
        They run like the lightnings.
002:005 He summons his picked troops.  They stumble on their way.
        They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place.
002:006 The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
002:007 It is decreed:  she is uncovered, she is carried away;
        and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves,
        beating on their breasts.
002:008 But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they
        flee away.  "Stop!  Stop!" they cry, but no one looks back.
002:009 Take the spoil of silver.  Take the spoil of gold, for there
        is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
002:010 She is empty, void, and waste.  The heart melts, the knees
        knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale.
002:011 Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place
        of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked,
        the lion's cubs, and no one made them afraid?
002:012 The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled
        for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill,
        and his dens with prey.
002:013 "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of Armies, "and I
        will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour
        your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth,
        and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."
003:001 Woe to the bloody city!  It is all full of lies and robbery.
        The prey doesn't depart.
003:002 The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels,
        prancing horses, and bounding chariots,
003:003 the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear,
        and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses,
        and there is no end of the bodies.  They stumble on their bodies,
003:004 because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring
        prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations
        through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft.
003:005 "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of Armies, "and I
        will lift your skirts over your face.  I will show the nations
        your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.
003:006 I will throw abominable filth on you, and make you vile,
        and will set you a spectacle.
003:007 It will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you,
        and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste!  Who will mourn for her?'
        Where will I seek comforters for you?"
003:008 Are you better than No-Amon,{or, Thebes} who was situated among
        the rivers, who had the waters around her; whose rampart
        was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?
003:009 Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength.  Put and Libya
        were her helpers.
003:010 Yet was she carried away.  She went into captivity.
        Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head
        of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men,
        and all her great men were bound in chains.
003:011 You also will be drunken.  You will be hidden.  You also will
        seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
003:012 All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs:
        if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
003:013 Behold, your troops in your midst are women.
        The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies.
        The fire has devoured your bars.
003:014 Draw water for the siege.  Strengthen your fortresses.
        Go into the clay, and tread the mortar.  Make the brick kiln strong.
003:015 There the fire will devour you.  The sword will cut you off.  It will
        devour you like the grasshopper.  Multiply like grasshoppers.
        Multiply like the locust.
003:016 You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies.
        The grasshopper strips, and flees away.
003:017 Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like
        the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day,
        but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place
        is not known where they are.
003:018 Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria.  Your nobles lie down.
        Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no
        one to gather them.
003:019 There is no healing your wound, for your injury is fatal.
        All who hear the report of you clap their hands over you;
        for who hasn't felt your endless cruelty?
Book 35 Habakkuk
001:001 The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
001:002 Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear?
        I cry out to you "Violence!" and will you not save?
001:003 Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity?
        For destruction and violence are before me.  There is strife,
        and contention rises up.
001:004 Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth;
        for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice
        goes forth perverted.
001:005 "Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously;
        for I am working a work in your days, which you will not
        believe though it is told you.
001:006 For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and
        hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth,
        to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.
001:007 They are feared and dreaded.  Their judgment and their dignity
        proceed from themselves.
001:008 Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce
        than the evening wolves.  Their horsemen press proudly on.
        Yes, their horsemen come from afar.  They fly as an eagle
        that hurries to devour.
001:009 All of them come for violence.  Their hordes face the desert.
        He gathers prisoners like sand.
001:010 Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him.
        He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp,
        and takes it.
001:011 Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on.  He is indeed guilty,
        whose strength is his god."
001:012 Aren't you from everlasting, Yahweh my God, my Holy One?  We will
        not die.  Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment.
        You, Rock, have established him to punish.
001:013 You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look
        on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously,
        and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is
        more righteous than he,
001:014 and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things,
        that have no ruler over them?
001:015 He takes up all of them with the hook.  He catches them in his net,
        and gathers them in his dragnet.  Therefore he rejoices
        and is glad.
001:016 Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense
        to his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious,
        and his food is good.
001:017 Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill
        the nations without mercy?
002:001 I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts,
        and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I
        will answer concerning my complaint.
002:002 Yahweh answered me, "Write the vision, and make it plain
        on tablets, that he may run who reads it.
002:003 For the vision is yet for the appointed time,
        and it hurries toward the end, and won't prove false.
        Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come.
        It won't delay.
002:004 Behold, his soul is puffed up.  It is not upright in him,
        but the righteous will live by his faith.
002:005 Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous.  A haughty man who doesn't stay
        at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is like death,
        and can't be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations,
        and heaps to himself all peoples.
002:006 Won't all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting
        proverb against him, and say, 'Woe to him who increases
        that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion!
        How long?'
002:007 Won't your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make
        you tremble, and you will be their victim?
002:008 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant
        of the peoples will plunder you, because of men's blood,
        and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all
        who dwell in it.
002:009 Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set
        his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
002:010 You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples,
        and have sinned against your soul.
002:011 For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out
        of the woodwork will answer it.
002:012 Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes
        a city by iniquity!
002:013 Behold, isn't it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor
        for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?
002:014 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory
        of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.
002:015 "Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your
        inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze
        at their naked bodies!
002:016 You are filled with shame, and not glory.  You will also drink,
        and be exposed!  The cup of Yahweh's right hand will come
        around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.
002:017 For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
        and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid;
        because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land,
        to every city and to those who dwell in them.
002:018 "What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has
        engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies,
        that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?
002:019 Woe to him who says to the wood, 'Awake!' or to the mute
        stone, 'Arise!'  Shall this teach?  Behold, it is overlaid
        with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in
        the midst of it.
002:020 But Yahweh is in his holy temple.  Let all the earth be
        silent before him!"
003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music.
003:002 Yahweh, I have heard of your fame.  I stand in awe of
        your deeds, Yahweh.  Renew your work in the midst of the years.
        In the midst of the years make it known.  In wrath,
        you remember mercy.
003:003 God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran.  Selah.  His glory
        covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth.
003:004 His splendor is like the sunrise.  Rays shine from his hand,
        where his power is hidden.
003:005 Plague went before him, and pestilence followed his feet.
003:006 He stood, and shook the earth.  He looked, and made
        the nations tremble.  The ancient mountains were crumbled.
        The age-old hills collapsed.  His ways are eternal.
003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.  The dwellings
        of the land of Midian trembled.
003:008 Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers?  Was your anger against
        the rivers, or your wrath against the sea, that you rode
        on your horses, on your chariots of salvation?
003:009 You uncovered your bow.  You called for your sworn arrows.
        Selah.  You split the earth with rivers.
003:010 The mountains saw you, and were afraid.  The storm of waters
        passed by.  The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.
003:011 The sun and moon stood still in the sky, at the light of your
        arrows as they went, at the shining of your glittering spear.
003:012 You marched through the land in wrath.  You threshed
        the nations in anger.
003:013 You went forth for the salvation of your people, for the salvation
        of your anointed.  You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.
        You stripped them head to foot.  Selah.
003:014 You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears.
        They came as a whirlwind to scatter me, gloating as if to devour
        the wretched in secret.
003:015 You trampled the sea with your horses, churning mighty waters.
003:016 I heard, and my body trembled.  My lips quivered at the voice.
        Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place,
        because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
        for the coming up of the people who invade us.
003:017 For though the fig tree doesn't flourish, nor fruit be in the vines;
        the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food;
        the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd
        in the stalls:
003:018 yet I will rejoice in Yahweh.  I will be joyful in the God
        of my salvation!
003:019 Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength.  He makes my feet
        like deer's feet, and enables me to go in high places.
        For the music director, on my stringed instruments.
Book 36 Zephaniah
001:001 The word of Yahweh which came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi,
        the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah,
        in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah.
001:002 I will utterly sweep away everything off of the surface
        of the earth, says Yahweh.
001:003 I will sweep away man and animal.  I will sweep away the birds
        of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble
        with the wicked.  I will cut off man from the surface
        of the earth, says Yahweh.
001:004 I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all
        the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  I will cut off the remnant of Baal
        from this place:  the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests,
001:005 those who worship the army of the sky on the housetops,
        those who worship and swear by Yahweh and also swear by Malcam,
001:006 those who have turned back from following Yahweh, and those
        who haven't sought Yahweh nor inquired after him.
001:007 Be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the day
        of Yahweh is at hand.  For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice.
        He has consecrated his guests.
001:008 It will happen in the day of Yahweh's sacrifice, that I will
        punish the princes, the king's sons, and all those who are
        clothed with foreign clothing.
001:009 In that day, I will punish all those who leap over the threshold,
        who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.
001:010 In that day, says Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry
        from the fish gate, a wailing from the second quarter,
        and a great crashing from the hills.
001:011 Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan
        are undone!  All those who were loaded with silver are cut off.
001:012 It will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem
        with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on
        their dregs, who say in their heart, "Yahweh will not do good,
        neither will he do evil."
001:013 Their wealth will become a spoil, and their houses a desolation.
        Yes, they will build houses, but won't inhabit them.
        They will plant vineyards, but won't drink their wine.
001:014 The great day of Yahweh is near.  It is near,
        and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh.
        The mighty man cries there bitterly.
001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish,
        a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom,
        a day of clouds and blackness,
001:016 a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities,
        and against the high battlements.
001:017 I will bring distress on men, that they will walk like blind men,
        because they have sinned against Yahweh, and their blood
        will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung.
001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver
        them in the day of Yahweh's wrath, but the whole land will
        be devoured by the fire of his jealousy; for he will make
        an end, yes, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in the land.
002:001 Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, you nation
        that has no shame,
002:002 before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff,
        before the fierce anger of Yahweh comes on you, before the day
        of Yahweh's anger comes on you.
002:003 Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the land, who have kept
        his ordinances.  Seek righteousness.  Seek humility.
        It may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yahweh's anger.
002:004 For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation.
        They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will
        be rooted up.
002:005 Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation
        of the Cherethites!  The word of Yahweh is against you,
        Canaan, the land of the Philistines.  I will destroy you,
        that there will be no inhabitant.
002:006 The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds
        and folds for flocks.
002:007 The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah.
        They will find pasture.  In the houses of Ashkelon,
        they will lie down in the evening, for Yahweh, their God,
        will visit them, and restore them.
002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the
        children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people,
        and magnified themselves against their border.
002:009 Therefore as I live, says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel,
        surely Moab will be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah,
        a possession of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation.
        The remnant of my people will plunder them, and the survivors
        of my nation will inherit them.
002:010 This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached
        and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of Armies.
002:011 Yahweh will be awesome to them, for he will famish all the gods
        of the land.  Men will worship him, everyone from his place,
        even all the shores of the nations.
002:012 You Cushites also, you will be killed by my sword.
002:013 He will stretch out his hand against the north, destroy Assyria,
        and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.
002:014 Herds will lie down in the midst of her, all the animals
        of the nations.  Both the pelican and the porcupine will lodge
        in its capitals.  Their calls will echo through the windows.
        Desolation will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare
        the cedar beams.
002:015 This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said
        in her heart, "I am, and there is none besides me."
        How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down in!
        Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake their fists.
003:001 Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!
003:002 She didn't obey the voice.  She didn't receive correction.
        She didn't trust in Yahweh.  She didn't draw near to her God.
003:003 Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions.
        Her judges are evening wolves.  They leave nothing until
        the next day.
003:004 Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people.
        Her priests have profaned the sanctuary.  They have done
        violence to the law.
003:005 Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous.  He will do no wrong.
        Every morning he brings his justice to light.  He doesn't fail,
        but the unjust know no shame.
003:006 I have cut off nations.  Their battlements are desolate.
        I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by.
        Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man,
        so that there is no inhabitant.
003:007 I said, "Just fear me.  Receive correction, so that her dwelling won't
        be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her."
        But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
003:008 "Therefore wait for me," says Yahweh, "until the day that I rise
        up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations,
        that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation,
        even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured
        with the fire of my jealousy.
003:009 For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all
        call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.
003:010 From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter
        of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.
003:011 In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings,
        in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will
        take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones,
        and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain.
003:012 But I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people,
        and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh.
003:013 The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies,
        neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they
        will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid."
003:014 Sing, daughter of Zion!  Shout, Israel!  Be glad and rejoice
        with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.
003:015 Yahweh has taken away your judgments.  He has thrown out your enemy.
        The King of Israel, Yahweh, is in the midst of you.
        You will not be afraid of evil any more.
003:016 In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, "Don't be afraid, Zion.
        Don't let your hands be slack."
003:017 Yahweh, your God, is in the midst of you, a mighty one who will save.
        He will rejoice over you with joy.  He will rest in his love.
        He will rejoice over you with singing.
003:018 Those who are sad for the appointed feasts, I will remove from you.
        They are a burden and a reproach to you.
003:019 Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you,
        and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were
        driven away.  I will give them praise and honor, whose shame
        has been in all the earth.
003:020 At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I
        gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all
        the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity
        before your eyes, says Yahweh.
Book 37 Haggai
001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month,
        in the first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came
        by Haggai, the prophet, to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak,
        the high priest, saying,
001:002 "This is what Yahweh of Armies says:  These people say,
        'The time hasn't yet come, the time for Yahweh's house
        to be built.'"
001:003 Then the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai, the prophet, saying,
001:004 "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses,
        while this house lies waste?
001:005 Now therefore this is what Yahweh of Armies says:
        Consider your ways.
001:006 You have sown much, and bring in little.  You eat, but you don't
        have enough.  You drink, but you aren't filled with drink.
        You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns
        wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it."
001:007 This is what Yahweh of Armies says:  "Consider your ways.
001:008 Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house.
        I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified," says Yahweh.
001:009 "You looked for much, and, behold, it came to little;
        and when you brought it home, I blew it away.  Why?" says Yahweh
        of Armies, "Because of my house that lies waste, while each
        of you is busy with his own house.
001:010 Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew,
        and the earth withholds its fruit.
001:011 I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain,
        on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground brings forth,
        on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands."
001:012 Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son
        of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
        obeyed the voice of Yahweh, their God, and the words
        of Haggai, the prophet, as Yahweh, their God, had sent him;
        and the people feared Yahweh.
001:013 Then Haggai, Yahweh's messenger, spoke in Yahweh's message
        to the people, saying, "I am with you," says Yahweh.
001:014 Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak,
        the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people;
        and they came and worked on the house of Yahweh of Armies, their God,
001:015 in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month,
        in the second year of Darius the king.
002:001 In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month,
        the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
002:002 "Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,
        and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
        and to the remnant of the people, saying,
002:003 'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory?
        How do you see it now?  Isn't it in your eyes as nothing?
002:004 Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,' says Yahweh.
        'Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
        Be strong, all you people of the land,' says Yahweh, 'and work,
        for I am with you,' says Yahweh of Armies.
002:005 This is the word that I covenanted with you when you
        came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you.
        'Don't be afraid.'
002:006 For this is what Yahweh of Armies says:  'Yet once, it is
        a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth,
        the sea, and the dry land;
002:007 and I will shake all nations.  The precious things of all
        nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,
        says Yahweh of Armies.
002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' says Yahweh of Armies.
002:009 'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,'
        says Yahweh of Armies; 'and in this place will I give peace,'
        says Yahweh of Armies."
002:010 In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year
        of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
002:011 "Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Ask now the priests concerning
        the law, saying,
002:012 'If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment,
        and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food,
        will it become holy?'"  The priests answered, "No."
002:013 Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by reason
        of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?"
        The priests answered, "It will be unclean."
002:014 Then Haggai answered, "'So is this people, and so is this nation
        before me,' says Yahweh; 'and so is every work of their hands.
        That which they offer there is unclean.
002:015 Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone
        was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh.
002:016 Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures,
        there were only ten.  When one came to the wine vat to draw
        out fifty, there were only twenty.
002:017 I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work
        of your hands; yet you didn't turn to me,' says Yahweh.
002:018 'Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth
        day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation
        of Yahweh's temple was laid, consider it.
002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn?  Yes, the vine, the fig tree,
        the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven't brought forth.
        From this day will I bless you.'"
002:020 The Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the
        twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
002:021 "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, 'I will shake
        the heavens and the earth.
002:022 I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms.  I will
        destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations.
        I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them.
        The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword
        of his brother.
002:023 In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you,
        Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,' says Yahweh,
        'and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,'
        says Yahweh of Armies."
Book 38 Zechariah
001:001 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word
        of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
001:002 "Yahweh was very displeased with your fathers.
001:003 Therefore tell them:  Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  'Return to me,'
        says Yahweh of Armies, 'and I will return to you,'
        says Yahweh of Armies.
001:004 Don't you be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets
        proclaimed, saying:  Thus says Yahweh of Armies, 'Return now
        from your evil ways, and from your evil doings;' but they
        did not hear, nor listen to me, says Yahweh.
001:005 Your fathers, where are they?  And the prophets,
        do they live forever?
001:006 But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants
        the prophets, didn't they overtake your fathers?
        "Then they repented and said, 'Just as Yahweh of Armies
        determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according
        to our practices, so he has dealt with us.'"
001:007 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is
        the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of
        Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo,
        the prophet, saying,
001:008 "I had a vision in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse,
        and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in a ravine;
        and behind him there were red, brown, and white horses.
001:009 Then I asked, 'My lord, what are these?'"  The angel who talked
        with me said to me, "I will show you what these are."
001:010 The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, "They are
        the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth."
001:011 They reported to the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle trees,
        and said, "We have walked back and forth through the earth,
        and behold, all the earth is at rest and in peace."
001:012 Then the angel of Yahweh replied, "O Yahweh of Armies, how long
        will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah,
        against which you have had indignation these seventy years?"
001:013 Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind
        and comforting words.
001:014 So the angel who talked with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying,
        'Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "I am jealous for Jerusalem
        and for Zion with a great jealousy.
001:015 I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was
        but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity."
001:016 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  "I have returned to Jerusalem
        with mercy.  My house shall be built in it," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem."'
001:017 "Proclaim further, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "My cities
        will again overflow with prosperity, and Yahweh will again
        comfort Zion, and will again choose Jerusalem."'"
001:018 I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns.
001:019 I asked the angel who talked with me, "What are these?"
        He answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered
        Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
001:020 Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.
001:021 Then I asked, "What are these coming to do?"  He said,
        "These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man
        lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them,
        to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their
        horn against the land of Judah to scatter it."
002:001 I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring
        line in his hand.
002:002 Then I asked, "Where are you going?"  He said to me,
        "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what
        is its length."
002:003 Behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another
        angel went out to meet him,
002:004 and said to him, "Run, speak to this young man, saying,
        'Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls,
        because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.
002:005 For I,' says Yahweh, 'will be to her a wall of fire around it,
        and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
002:006 Come!  Come!  Flee from the land of the north,' says Yahweh;
        'for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,'
        says Yahweh.
002:007 'Come, Zion!  Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.'
002:008 For thus says Yahweh of Armies:  'For honor he has sent me
        to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you
        touches the apple of his eye.
002:009 For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be
        a spoil to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh
        of Armies has sent me.
002:010 Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come,
        and I will dwell in the midst of you,' says Yahweh.
002:011 Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day,
        and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you,
        and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.
002:012 Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land,
        and will again choose Jerusalem.
002:013 Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself
        from his holy habitation!"
003:001 He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before
        the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand
        to be his adversary.
003:002 Yahweh said to Satan, "Yahweh rebuke you, Satan!  Yes, Yahweh who
        has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!  Isn't this a burning stick
        plucked out of the fire?"
003:003 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing
        before the angel.
003:004 He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying,
        "Take the filthy garments off of him."  To him he said,
        "Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you,
        and I will clothe you with rich clothing."
003:005 I said, "Let them set a clean turban on his head."
        So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him;
        and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.
003:006 The angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,
003:007 "Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  'If you will walk in my ways,
        and if you will keep my charge, then you also shall judge
        my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you
        a place of access among these who stand by.
003:008 Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows
        who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign:
        for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch.
003:009 For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone
        are seven eyes:  behold, I will engrave the engraving of it,'
        says Yahweh of Armies, 'and I will remove the iniquity
        of that land in one day.
003:010 In that day,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'you will invite every
        man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.'"
004:001 The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me,
        as a man who is wakened out of his sleep.
004:002 He said to me, "What do you see?"  I said, "I have seen,
        and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on the top
        of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes
        to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;
004:003 and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl,
        and the other on the left side of it."
004:004 I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying,
        "What are these, my lord?"
004:005 Then the angel who talked with me answered me, "Don't you know
        what these are?"  I said, "No, my lord."
004:006 Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, "This is the word
        of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by might, nor by power,
        but by my Spirit,' says Yahweh of Armies.
004:007 Who are you, great mountain?  Before Zerubbabel you are a plain;
        and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of 'Grace,
        grace, to it!'"
004:008 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
004:009 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house.
        His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh
        of Armies has sent me to you.
004:010 Indeed, who despises the day of small things?
        For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line
        in the hand of Zerubbabel.  These are the eyes of Yahweh,
        which run back and forth through the whole earth."
004:011 Then I asked him, "What are these two olive trees on the right
        side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?"
004:012 I asked him the second time, "What are these two olive branches,
        which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the golden
        oil out of themselves?"
004:013 He answered me, "Don't you know what these are?"
        I said, "No, my lord."
004:014 Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand
        by the Lord of the whole earth."
005:001 Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold,
        a flying scroll.
005:002 He said to me, "What do you see?"  I answered, "I see a flying scroll;
        its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits."
005:003 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that goes out over
        the surface of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall
        be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone
        who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on
        the other side.
005:004 I will cause it to go out," says Yahweh of Armies, "and it
        will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house
        of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will remain
        in the midst of his house, and will destroy it with its timber
        and its stones."
005:005 Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and said to me,
        "Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that is appearing."
005:006 I said, "What is it?"  He said, "This is the ephah{ An ephah
        is a measure of volume of about 22 litres, 5.8 U. S. gallons,
        4.8 imperial gallons, or a bit more than half a bushel.
        } basket that is appearing."  He said moreover, "This is
        their appearance in all the land
005:007 (and behold, a talent{A talent is a weight of about 34 kilograms
        or 75 pounds.} of lead was lifted up); and this is a woman
        sitting in the midst of the ephah basket."
005:008 He said, "This is Wickedness;" and he threw her down into
        the midst of the ephah basket; and he threw the weight of lead
        on its mouth.
005:009 Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold,
        there were two women, and the wind was in their wings.
        Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted
        up the ephah basket between earth and the sky.
005:010 Then said I to the angel who talked with me, "Where are these
        carrying the ephah basket?"
005:011 He said to me, "To build her a house in the land of Shinar.
        When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place."
006:001 Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots
        came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were
        mountains of brass.
006:002 In the first chariot were red horses; in the second
        chariot black horses;
006:003 in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot
        dappled horses, all of them powerful.
006:004 Then I asked the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?"
006:005 The angel answered me, "These are the four winds of the sky,
        which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
006:006 The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country;
        and the white went out after them; and the dappled went forth
        toward the south country."
006:007 The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk
        back and forth through the earth:  and he said, "Go around
        and through the earth!"  So they walked back and forth
        through the earth.
006:008 Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, "Behold,
        those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit
        in the north country."
006:009 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
006:010 "Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah,
        and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house
        of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.
006:011 Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on
        the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;
006:012 and speak to him, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Armies, "Behold,
        the man whose name is the Branch:  and he shall grow up out
        of his place; and he shall build the temple of Yahweh;
006:013 even he shall build the temple of Yahweh; and he shall bear
        the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall
        be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall
        be between them both.
006:014 The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,
        and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the
        temple of Yahweh.
006:015 Those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of Yahweh;
        and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.
        This will happen, if you will diligently obey the voice
        of Yahweh your God."'"
007:001 It happened in the fourth year of king Darius that the word
        of Yahweh came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month,
        the month of Chislev.
007:002 The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem Melech, and their men,
        to entreat Yahweh's favor,
007:003 and to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of Armies,
        and to the prophets, saying, "Should I weep in the fifth month,
        separating myself, as I have done these so many years?"
007:004 Then the word of Yahweh of Armies came to me, saying,
007:005 "Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying,
        'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh
        month for these seventy years, did you at all fast to me,
        really to me?
007:006 When you eat, and when you drink, don't you eat for yourselves,
        and drink for yourselves?
007:007 Aren't these the words which Yahweh proclaimed by the former prophets,
        when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and its cities
        around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?'"
007:008 The word of Yahweh came to Zechariah, saying,
007:009 "Thus has Yahweh of Armies spoken, saying, 'Execute true judgment,
        and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother.
007:010 Don't oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the foreigner,
        nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his
        brother in your heart.'
007:011 But they refused to listen, and turned their backs, and stopped
        their ears, that they might not hear.
007:012 Yes, they made their hearts as hard as flint, lest they might
        hear the law, and the words which Yahweh of Armies had sent
        by his Spirit by the former prophets.  Therefore great wrath
        came from Yahweh of Armies.
007:013 It has come to pass that, as he called, and they refused
        to listen, so they will call, and I will not listen,"
        said Yahweh of Armies;
007:014 "but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations
        which they have not known.  Thus the land was desolate
        after them, so that no man passed through nor returned:
        for they made the pleasant land desolate."
008:001 The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.
008:002 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "I am jealous for Zion with
        great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath."
008:003 Thus says Yahweh:  "I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the
        midst of Jerusalem.  Jerusalem shall be called 'The City of Truth;'
        and the mountain of Yahweh of Armies, 'The Holy Mountain.'"
008:004 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "Old men and old women will again
        dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff
        in his hand for very age.
008:005 The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing
        in its streets."
008:006 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "If it is marvelous in the eyes
        of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be
        marvelous in my eyes?" says Yahweh of Armies.
008:007 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "Behold, I will save my people
        from the east country, and from the west country;
008:008 and I will bring them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem;
        and they will be my people, and I will be their God,
        in truth and in righteousness."
008:009 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "Let your hands be strong,
        you who hear in these days these words from the mouth
        of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation
        of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid, even the temple,
        that it might be built.
008:010 For before those days there was no wages for man,
        nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace
        to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary.
        For I set all men everyone against his neighbor.
008:011 But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in
        the former days," says Yahweh of Armies.
008:012 "For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit,
        and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will
        give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people
        to inherit all these things.
008:013 It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among
        the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I
        save you, and you shall be a blessing.  Don't be afraid.
        Let your hands be strong."
008:014 For thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "As I thought to do evil to you,
        when your fathers provoked me to wrath," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "and I didn't repent;
008:015 so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem
        and to the house of Judah.  Don't be afraid.
008:016 These are the things that you shall do:  speak every man
        the truth with his neighbor.  Execute the judgment of truth
        and peace in your gates,
008:017 and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against
        his neighbor, and love no false oath:  for all these are things
        that I hate," says Yahweh.
008:018 The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.
008:019 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "The fasts of the fourth fifth,
        seventh, and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah
        joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts.  Therefore love
        truth and peace."
008:020 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "Many peoples, and the inhabitants
        of many cities will yet come;
008:021 and the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, 'Let us
        go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh, and to seek Yahweh
        of Armies.  I will go also.'
008:022 Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh
        of Armies in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Yahweh."
008:023 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  "In those days, ten men will take hold,
        out of all the languages of the nations, they will take hold
        of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, 'We will go with you,
        for we have heard that God is with you.'"
009:001 An oracle.  The word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach,
        and will rest upon Damascus; for the eye of man and of all
        the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh;
009:002 and Hamath, also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon,
        because they are very wise.
009:003 Tyre built herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver like the dust,
        and fine gold like the mire of the streets.
009:004 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will strike her
        power in the sea; and she will be devoured with fire.
009:005 Ashkelon will see it, and fear; Gaza also, and will writhe in agony;
        as will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed;
        and the king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will
        not be inhabited.
009:006 Foreigners will dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride
        of the Philistines.
009:007 I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations
        from between his teeth; and he also will be a remnant for our God;
        and he will be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
009:008 I will encamp around my house against the army, that none pass
        through or return; and no oppressor will pass through them any more:
        for now I have seen with my eyes.
009:009 Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!  Shout, daughter
        of Jerusalem!  Behold, your king comes to you!  He is righteous,
        and having salvation; lowly, and riding on a donkey,
        even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
009:010 I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem;
        and the battle bow will be cut off; and he will speak peace
        to the nations:  and his dominion will be from sea to sea,
        and from the River to the ends of the earth.
009:011 As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant, I have
        set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.
009:012 Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope!  Even today I
        declare that I will restore double to you.
009:013 For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me.  I have filled
        the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up your sons, Zion,
        against your sons, Greece, and will make you like the sword
        of a mighty man.
009:014 Yahweh will be seen over them; and his arrow will go flash
        like lightning; and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,
        and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
009:015 Yahweh of Armies will defend them; and they will destroy
        and overcome with sling stones; and they will drink,
        and roar as through wine; and they will be filled like bowls,
        like the corners of the altar.
009:016 Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock
        of his people; for they are like the jewels of a crown,
        lifted on high over his land.
009:017 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!
        Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.
010:001 Ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time, Yahweh who makes
        storm clouds, and he gives rain showers to everyone for
        the plants in the field.
010:002 For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen
        a lie; and they have told false dreams.  They comfort in vain.
        Therefore they go their way like sheep.  They are oppressed,
        because there is no shepherd.
010:003 My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish
        the male goats; For Yahweh of Armies has visited his flock,
        the house of Judah, and will make them as his majestic horse
        in the battle.
010:004 From him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the nail,
        from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.
010:005 They shall be as mighty men, treading down muddy streets in
        the battle; and they shall fight, because Yahweh is with them;
        and the riders on horses will be confounded.
010:006 "I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house
        of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy on them;
        and they will be as though I had not cast them off:
        for I am Yahweh their God, and I will hear them.
010:007 Ephraim will be like a mighty man, and their heart will rejoice
        as through wine; yes, their children will see it, and rejoice.
        Their heart will be glad in Yahweh.
010:008 I will signal for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them;
        and they will increase as they have increased.
010:009 I will sow them among the peoples; and they will remember me
        in far countries; and they will live with their children,
        and will return.
010:010 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt,
        and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into
        the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and there won't be room
        enough for them.
010:011 He will pass through the sea of affliction, and will strike
        the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile will dry up;
        and the pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter
        of Egypt will depart.
010:012 I will strengthen them in Yahweh; and they will walk up
        and down in his name," says Yahweh.
011:001 Open your doors, Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.
011:002 Wail, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the stately
        ones are destroyed.  Wail, you oaks of Bashan, for the strong
        forest has come down.
011:003 A voice of the wailing of the shepherds!  For their glory
        is destroyed:  a voice of the roaring of young lions!
        For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
011:004 Thus says Yahweh my God:  "Feed the flock of slaughter.
011:005 Their buyers slaughter them, and go unpunished.
        Those who sell them say, 'Blessed be Yahweh, for I am rich;'
        and their own shepherds don't pity them.
011:006 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,"
        says Yahweh; "but, behold, I will deliver the men everyone
        into his neighbor's hand, and into the hand of his king.
        They will strike the land, and out of their hand I will
        not deliver them."
011:007 So I fed the flock of slaughter, especially the oppressed
        of the flock.  I took for myself two staffs.
        The one I called "Favor," and the other I called "Union,"
        and I fed the flock.
011:008 I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was
        weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.
011:009 Then I said, "I will not feed you.  That which dies, let it die;
        and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off;
        and let those who are left eat each other's flesh."
011:010 I took my staff Favor, and cut it apart, that I might break
        my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
011:011 It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock
        that listened to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh.
011:012 I said to them, "If you think it best, give me my wages;
        and if not, keep them."  So they weighed for my wages thirty
        pieces of silver.
011:013 Yahweh said to me, "Throw it to the potter, the handsome price
        that I was valued at by them!"  I took the thirty pieces of silver,
        and threw them to the potter, in the house of Yahweh.
011:014 Then I cut apart my other staff, even Union, that I might break
        the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
011:015 Yahweh said to me, "Take for yourself yet again the equipment
        of a foolish shepherd.
011:016 For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land,
        who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek
        those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken,
        nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh
        of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.
011:017 Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock!
        The sword will be on his arm, and on his right eye.
        His arm will be completely withered, and his right eye will
        be totally blinded!"
012:001 An oracle.  The word of Yahweh concerning Israel.
        Yahweh, who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation
        of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him says:
012:002 "Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all
        the surrounding peoples, and on Judah also will it be in
        the siege against Jerusalem.
012:003 It will happen in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome
        stone for all the peoples.  All who burden themselves with it
        will be severely wounded, and all the nations of the earth
        will be gathered together against it.
012:004 In that day," says Yahweh, "I will strike every horse
        with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open
        my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse
        of the peoples with blindness.
012:005 The chieftains of Judah will say in their heart, 'The inhabitants
        of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Armies their God.'
012:006 In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan
        of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves;
        and they will devour all the surrounding peoples, on the right
        hand and on the left; and Jerusalem will yet again dwell
        in their own place, even in Jerusalem.
012:007 Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory
        of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem not be magnified above Judah.
012:008 In that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
        He who is feeble among them at that day will be like David,
        and the house of David will be like God, like the angel
        of Yahweh before them.
012:009 It will happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all
        the nations that come against Jerusalem.
012:010 I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they will
        look to me{After "me," the Hebrew has the two letters "Aleph Tav"
        (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet), not as
        a word, but as a grammatical marker.} whom they have pierced;
        and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son,
        and will grieve bitterly for him, as one grieves for his firstborn.
012:011 In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem,
        like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
012:012 The land will mourn, every family apart; the family of the house
        of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house
        of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
012:013 the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
        the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;
012:014 all the families who remain, every family apart,
        and their wives apart.
013:001 "In that day there will be a spring opened to the house
        of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin
        and for uncleanness.
013:002 It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies,
        that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land,
        and they will be remembered no more.  I will also cause
        the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.
013:003 It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies,
        then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him,
        'You must die, because you speak lies in the name of Yahweh;'
        and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him
        when he prophesies.
013:004 It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be
        ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they
        wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
013:005 but he will say, 'I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground;
        for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.'
013:006 One will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?'
        Then he will answer, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house
        of my friends.'
013:007 "Awake, sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is
        close to me," says Yahweh of Armies.  "Strike the shepherd,
        and the sheep will be scattered; and I will turn my hand
        against the little ones.
013:008 It shall happen that in all the land," says Yahweh, "two parts
        in it will be cut off and die; but the third will be left in it.
013:009 I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them
        as silver is refined, and will test them like gold is tested.
        They will call on my name, and I will hear them.  I will say,
        'It is my people;' and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God.'"
014:001 Behold, a day of Yahweh comes, when your spoil will be divided
        in your midst.
014:002 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the
        city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished.
        Half of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest
        of the people will not be cut off from the city.
014:003 Then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations,
        as when he fought in the day of battle.
014:004 His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is
        before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be
        split in two, from east to west, making a very great valley.
        Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half
        of it toward the south.
014:005 You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley
        of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee,
        just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days
        of Uzziah king of Judah.  Yahweh my God will come, and all
        the holy ones with you.
014:006 It will happen in that day, that there will not be light,
        cold, or frost.
014:007 It will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh; not day,
        and not night; but it will come to pass, that at evening time
        there will be light.
014:008 It will happen in that day, that living waters will go
        out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea,
        and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter
        will it be.
014:009 Yahweh will be King over all the earth.  In that day Yahweh
        will be one, and his name one.
014:010 All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba
        to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up,
        and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place
        of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower
        of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
014:011 Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse;
        but Jerusalem will dwell safely.
014:012 This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike
        all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem:
        their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet,
        and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their
        tongue will consume away in their mouth.
014:013 It will happen in that day, that a great panic from Yahweh
        will be among them; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand
        of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand
        of his neighbor.
014:014 Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
        the surrounding nations will be gathered together:
        gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.
014:015 So will be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel,
        and of the donkey, and of all the animals that will be in
        those camps, as that plague.
014:016 It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that
        came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship
        the King, Yahweh of Armies, and to keep the feast of tents.
014:017 It will be, that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn't
        go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies,
        on them there will be no rain.
014:018 If the family of Egypt doesn't go up, and doesn't come,
        neither will it rain on them.  This will be the plague
        with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don't go up
        to keep the feast of tents.
014:019 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all
        the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of tents.
014:020 In that day there will be on the bells of the horses,
        "HOLY TO YAHWEH;" and the pots in Yahweh's house will be
        like the bowls before the altar.
014:021 Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh
        of Armies; and all those who sacrifice will come and take
        of them, and cook in them.  In that day there will no longer
        be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of Armies.
Book 39 Malachi
001:001 An oracle:  the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.
001:002 "I have loved you," says Yahweh.  Yet you say,
        "How have you loved us?"  "Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?"
        says Yahweh, "Yet I loved Jacob;
001:003 but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation,
        and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness."
001:004 Whereas Edom says, "We are beaten down, but we will return and build
        the waste places;" thus says Yahweh of Armies, "They shall build,
        but I will throw down; and men will call them 'The Wicked Land,'
        even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever."
001:005 Your eyes will see, and you will say, "Yahweh is great--
        even beyond the border of Israel!"
001:006 "A son honors his father, and a servant his master.
        If I am a father, then where is my honor?
        And if I am a master, where is the respect due me?
        Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name.
        You say, 'How have we despised your name?'
001:007 You offer polluted bread on my altar.  You say, 'How have we
        polluted you?'  In that you say, 'Yahweh's table contemptible.'
001:008 When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn't that evil?
        And when you offer the lame and sick, isn't that evil?
        Present it now to your governor!  Will he be pleased with you?
        Or will he accept your person?" says Yahweh of Armies.
001:009 "Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us.
        With this, will he accept any of you?" says Yahweh of Armies.
001:010 "Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors,
        that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain!
        I have no pleasure in you," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
001:011 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same,
        my name is great among the nations, and in every place
        incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering:
        for my name is great among the nations," says Yahweh of Armies.
001:012 "But you profane it, in that you say, 'Yahweh's table is polluted,
        and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.'
001:013 You say also, 'Behold, what a weariness it is!'
        and you have sniffed at it," says Yahweh of Armies;
        "and you have brought that which was taken by violence,
        the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering.
        Should I accept this at your hand?" says Yahweh.
001:014 "But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male,
        and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing;
        for I am a great King," says Yahweh of Armies, "and my name
        is awesome among the nations."
002:001 "Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.
002:002 If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart,
        to give glory to my name," says Yahweh of Armies, "then will
        I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings.
        Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay
        it to heart.
002:003 Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on
        your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken
        away with it.
002:004 You will know that I have sent this commandment to you,
        that my covenant may be with Levi," says Yahweh of Armies.
002:005 "My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them
        to him who he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent
        toward me, and stood in awe of my name.
002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not
        found in his lips.  He walked with me in peace and uprightness,
        and turned many away from iniquity.
002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they
        should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger
        of Yahweh of Armies.
002:008 But you have turned aside out of the way.  You have caused many
        to stumble in the law.  You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
002:009 "Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all
        the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways,
        but have had respect for persons in the law.
002:010 Don't we all have one father?  Hasn't one God created us?
        Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother,
        profaning the covenant of our fathers?
002:011 Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed
        in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness
        of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter
        of a foreign god.
002:012 Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes
        and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him
        who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.
002:013 This again you do:  you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears,
        with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn't regard
        the offering any more, neither receives it with good will
        at your hand.
002:014 Yet you say, 'Why?'  Because Yahweh has been witness
        between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you
        have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion,
        and the wife of your covenant.
002:015 Did he not make one, although he had the residue
        of the Spirit?  Why one?  He sought a godly seed.
        Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal
        treacherously against the wife of his youth.
002:016 For I hate divorce," says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        "and him who covers his garment with violence!" says Yahweh
        of Armies.  "Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you
        don't deal treacherously.
002:017 You have wearied Yahweh with your words.  Yet you say,
        'How have we wearied him?'  In that you say, 'Everyone who does
        evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them;'
        or 'Where is the God of justice?'
003:001 "Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me;
        and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple;
        and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold,
        he comes!" says Yahweh of Armies.
003:002 "But who can endure the day of his coming?  And who will
        stand when he appears?  For he is like a refiner's fire,
        and like launderer's soap;
003:003 and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will
        purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver;
        and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.
003:004 Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant
        to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
003:005 I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
        witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,
        and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress
        the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless,
        and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don't fear me,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
003:006 "For I, Yahweh, don't change; therefore you, sons of Jacob,
        are not consumed.
003:007 From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from
        my ordinances, and have not kept them.  Return to me,
        and I will return to you," says Yahweh of Armies.
        "But you say, 'How shall we return?'
003:008 Will a man rob God?  Yet you rob me!  But you say, 'How have we
        robbed you?'  In tithes and offerings.
003:009 You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me,
        even this whole nation.
003:010 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food
        in my house, and test me now in this," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you
        out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for.
003:011 I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall
        not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall
        your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
003:012 "All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a
        delightful land," says Yahweh of Armies.
003:013 "Your words have been stout against me," says Yahweh.
        "Yet you say, 'What have we spoken against you?'
003:014 You have said, 'It is vain to serve God;' and 'What profit
        is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked
        mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?
003:015 Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness
        are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.'
003:016 Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another;
        and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory
        was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh,
        and who honored his name.
003:017 They shall be mine," says Yahweh of Armies, "my own possession
        in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares
        his own son who serves him.
003:018 Then you shall return and discern between the righteous
        and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who
        doesn't serve him.
004:001 "For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all
        the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble;
        and the day that comes will burn them up," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
004:002 But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness
        arise with healing in its wings.  You will go out, and leap
        like calves of the stall.
004:003 You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes
        under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
004:004 "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him
        in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great
        and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
004:006 He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
        and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come
        and strike the earth with a curse."
Book 40 Matthew
001:001 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ{Christ (Greek)
        and Messiah (Hebrew) both mean "Anointed One"}, the son of David,
        the son of Abraham.
001:002 Abraham became the father of Isaac.  Isaac became the father
        of Jacob.  Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.
001:003 Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar.
        Perez became the father of Hezron.  Hezron became the
        father of Ram.
001:004 Ram became the father of Amminadab.  Amminadab became the father
        of Nahshon.  Nahshon became the father of Salmon.
001:005 Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab.  Boaz became
        the father of Obed by Ruth.  Obed became the father of Jesse.
001:006 Jesse became the father of David the king.  David became
        the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
001:007 Solomon became the father of Rehoboam.  Rehoboam became
        the father of Abijah.  Abijah became the father of Asa.
001:008 Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat.  Jehoshaphat became
        the father of Joram.  Joram became the father of Uzziah.
001:009 Uzziah became the father of Jotham.  Jotham became the father
        of Ahaz.  Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.
001:010 Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh.  Manasseh became
        the father of Amon.  Amon became the father of Josiah.
001:011 Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers,
        at the time of the exile to Babylon.
001:012 After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel.
        Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
001:013 Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud.  Abiud became the father
        of Eliakim.  Eliakim became the father of Azor.
001:014 Azor became the father of Sadoc.  Sadoc became the father of Achim.
        Achim became the father of Eliud.
001:015 Eliud became the father of Eleazar.  Eleazar became the father
        of Matthan.  Matthan became the father of Jacob.
001:016 Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary,
        from whom was born Jesus{"Jesus" means "Salvation."},
        who is called Christ.
001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations;
        from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations;
        and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ,
        fourteen generations.
001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother,
        Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together,
        she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
001:019 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing
        to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.
001:020 But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord
        appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David,
        don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife,
        for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
001:021 She shall bring forth a son.  You shall call his name Jesus,
        for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."
001:022 Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was
        spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
001:023 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son.
        They shall call his name Immanuel;" which is, being interpreted,
        "God with us."{Isaiah 7:14}
001:024 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord
        commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
001:025 and didn't know her sexually until she had brought forth her
        firstborn son.  He named him Jesus.
002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
        of Herod the king, behold, wise men{The word for "wise men"
        (magoi) can also mean teachers, scientists, physicians,
        astrologers, seers, interpreters of dreams, or sorcerers.}
        from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
002:002 "Where is he who is born King of the Jews?  For we saw his star
        in the east, and have come to worship him."
002:003 When Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all
        Jerusalem with him.
002:004 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people,
        he asked them where the Christ would be born.
002:005 They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written
        through the prophet,
002:006 'You Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least among
        the princes of Judah:  for out of you shall come forth a governor,
        who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"{Micah 5:2}
002:007 Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them
        exactly what time the star appeared.
002:008 He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently
        for the young child.  When you have found him, bring me word,
        so that I also may come and worship him."
002:009 They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold,
        the star, which they saw in the east, went before them,
        until it came and stood over where the young child was.
002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
002:011 They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary,
        his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him.
        Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts:
        gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
002:012 Being warned in a dream that they shouldn't return to Herod,
        they went back to their own country another way.
002:013 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
        to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child
        and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I
        tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
002:014 He arose and took the young child and his mother by night,
        and departed into Egypt,
002:015 and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,
        saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."{Hosea 11:1}
002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men,
        was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children
        who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside,
        from two years old and under, according to the exact time
        which he had learned from the wise men.
002:017 Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet
        was fulfilled, saying,
002:018 "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
        Rachel weeping for her children; she wouldn't be comforted,
        because they are no more."{Jeremiah 31:15}
002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
        in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
002:020 "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into
        the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's
        life are dead."
002:021 He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came
        into the land of Israel.
002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea
        in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there.
        Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,
002:023 and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it
        might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets:
        "He will be called a Nazarene."
003:001 In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness
        of Judea, saying,
003:002 "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
003:003 For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
        "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way
        of the Lord.  Make his paths straight."{Isaiah 40:3}
003:004 Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair,
        with a leather belt around his waist.  His food was locusts
        and wild honey.
003:005 Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region
        around the Jordan went out to him.
003:006 They were baptized{or, immersed} by him in the Jordan,
        confessing their sins.
003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming
        for his baptism,{or, immersion} he said to them, "You offspring
        of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
003:008 Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
003:009 Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,'
        for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham
        from these stones.
003:010 "Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees.
        Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit
        is cut down, and cast into the fire.
003:011 I indeed baptize{or, immerse} you in water for repentance,
        but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am
        not worthy to carry.  He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.{TR
        and NU add "and with fire"}
003:012 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse
        his threshing floor.  He will gather his wheat into the barn,
        but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
003:013 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be
        baptized by him.
003:014 But John would have hindered him, saying, "I need to be baptized
        by you, and you come to me?"
003:015 But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this
        is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness."
        Then he allowed him.
003:016 Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water:
        and behold, the heavens were opened to him.  He saw the Spirit
        of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.
003:017 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son,
        with whom I am well pleased."
004:001 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
        tempted by the devil.
004:002 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights,
        he was hungry afterward.
004:003 The tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God,
        command that these stones become bread."
004:004 But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by
        bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth
        of God.'"{Deuteronomy 8:3}
004:005 Then the devil took him into the holy city.  He set him on
        the pinnacle of the temple,
004:006 and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down,
        for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge concerning you.'
        and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don't
        dash your foot against a stone.'"{Psalm 91:11-12}
004:007 Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test
        the Lord, your God.'"{Deuteronomy 6:16}
004:008 Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain,
        and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
004:009 He said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you
        will fall down and worship me."
004:010 Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me,{TR and NU read "Go away"
        instead of "Get behind me"} Satan!  For it is written,
        'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall
        you serve.'"{Deuteronomy 6:13}
004:011 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
004:012 Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up,
        he withdrew into Galilee.
004:013 Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is
        by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
004:014 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
        the prophet, saying,
004:015 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea,
        beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
004:016 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, to those
        who sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light
        has dawned."{Isaiah 9:1-2}
004:017 From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent!  For the
        Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
004:018 Walking by the sea of Galilee, he{TR reads "Jesus"
        instead of "he"} saw two brothers:  Simon, who is called Peter,
        and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea;
        for they were fishermen.
004:019 He said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you
        fishers for men."
004:020 They immediately left their nets and followed him.
004:021 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son
        of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee
        their father, mending their nets.  He called them.
004:022 They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
004:023 Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
        preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every
        disease and every sickness among the people.
004:024 The report about him went out into all Syria.  They brought
        to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases
        and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics;
        and he healed them.
004:025 Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and
        from beyond the Jordan followed him.
005:001 Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain.
        When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
005:002 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
005:003 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom
        of Heaven.{Isaiah 57:15; 66:2}
005:004 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.{Isaiah 61:2;
        66:10,13}
005:005 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.{or, land.
        Psalm 37:11}
005:006 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
        for they shall be filled.
005:007 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called
        children of God.
005:010 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness'
        sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:011 "Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you,
        and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
005:012 Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven.
        For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
005:013 "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor,
        with what will it be salted?  It is then good for nothing,
        but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.
005:014 You are the light of the world.  A city located on a hill
        can't be hidden.
005:015 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket,
        but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.
005:016 Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see
        your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
005:017 "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets.
        I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.
005:018 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away,
        not even one smallest letter{literally, iota} or one tiny
        pen stroke{or, serif} shall in any way pass away from the law,
        until all things are accomplished.
005:019 Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments,
        and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom
        of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called
        great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:020 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of
        the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter
        into the Kingdom of Heaven.
005:021 "You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones,
        'You shall not murder;'{Exodus 20:13} and 'Whoever shall
        murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'
005:022 But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother
        without a cause{NU omits "without a cause".} shall be in danger
        of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca{"Raca"
        is an Aramaic insult, related to the word for "empty"
        and conveying the idea of empty-headedness.}!' shall be
        in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!'
        shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.{or, Hell}
005:023 "If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar,
        and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
005:024 leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way.
        First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and
        offer your gift.
005:025 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him
        in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you
        to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer,
        and you be cast into prison.
005:026 Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there,
        until you have paid the last penny.{literally, kodrantes.
        A kodrantes was a small copper coin worth about 2 lepta
        (widow's mites)--not enough to buy very much of anything.}
005:027 "You have heard that it was said, {TR adds "to the ancients,"}
        'You shall not commit adultery;'{Exodus 20:14}
005:028 but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after
        her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
005:029 If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and
        throw it away from you.  For it is more profitable for you
        that one of your members should perish, than for your whole
        body to be cast into Gehenna.{or, Hell}
005:030 If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off,
        and throw it away from you.  For it is more profitable for you
        that one of your members should perish, than for your whole
        body to be cast into Gehenna.{or, Hell}
005:031 "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him
        give her a writing of divorce,'{Deuteronomy 24:1}
005:032 but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for
        the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress;
        and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.
005:033 "Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time,
        'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the
        Lord your vows,'
005:034 but I tell you, don't swear at all:  neither by heaven,
        for it is the throne of God;
005:035 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet;
        nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
005:036 Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one
        hair white or black.
005:037 But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is
        more than these is of the evil one.
005:038 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth
        for a tooth.'{Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21}
005:039 But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever
        strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
005:040 If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have
        your cloak also.
005:041 Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
005:042 Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires
        to borrow from you.
005:043 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor,
        and hate your enemy.'{Leviticus 19:18}
005:044 But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you,
        do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat
        you and persecute you,
005:045 that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven.
        For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good,
        and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
005:046 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
        Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
005:047 If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others?
        Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
005:048 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in
        heaven is perfect.
006:001 "Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before men,
        to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father
        who is in heaven.
006:002 Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don't sound a trumpet
        before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
        and in the streets, that they may get glory from men.
        Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
006:003 But when you do merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know
        what your right hand does,
006:004 so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father
        who sees in secret will reward you openly.
006:005 "When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites,
        for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in
        the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men.
        Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.
006:006 But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber,
        and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret,
        and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
006:007 In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do;
        for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
006:008 Therefore don't be like them, for your Father knows what things
        you need, before you ask him.
006:009 Pray like this:  'Our Father in heaven, may your name
        be kept holy.
006:010 Let your Kingdom come.  Let your will be done, as in heaven,
        so on earth.
006:011 Give us today our daily bread.
006:012 Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
006:013 Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
        For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
        Amen.{NU omits "For yours is the Kingdom, the power,
        and the glory forever.  Amen."}'
006:014 "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
        will also forgive you.
006:015 But if you don't forgive men their trespasses, neither will
        your Father forgive your trespasses.
006:016 "Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites,
        with sad faces.  For they disfigure their faces, that they
        may be seen by men to be fasting.  Most certainly I tell you,
        they have received their reward.
006:017 But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
006:018 so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your
        Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret,
        will reward you.
006:019 "Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth
        and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
006:020 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
        moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break
        through and steal;
006:021 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
006:022 "The lamp of the body is the eye.  If therefore your eye is sound,
        your whole body will be full of light.
006:023 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness.
        If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great
        is the darkness!
006:024 "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one
        and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and
        despise the other.  You can't serve both God and Mammon.
006:025 Therefore, I tell you, don't be anxious for your life:
        what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body,
        what you will wear.  Isn't life more than food, and the body
        more than clothing?
006:026 See the birds of the sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap,
        nor gather into barns.  Your heavenly Father feeds them.
        Aren't you of much more value than they?
006:027 "Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment{literally,
        cubit} to his lifespan?
006:028 Why are you anxious about clothing?  Consider the lilies of the field,
        how they grow.  They don't toil, neither do they spin,
006:029 yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not
        dressed like one of these.
006:030 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists,
        and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more
        clothe you, you of little faith?
006:031 "Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?',
        'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?'
006:032 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly
        Father knows that you need all these things.
006:033 But seek first God's Kingdom, and his righteousness;
        and all these things will be given to you as well.
006:034 Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be
        anxious for itself.  Each day's own evil is sufficient.
007:001 "Don't judge, so that you won't be judged.
007:002 For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged;
        and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
007:003 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye,
        but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
007:004 Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck
        from your eye;' and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
007:005 You hypocrite!  First remove the beam out of your own eye,
        and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of
        your brother's eye.
007:006 "Don't give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw
        your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them
        under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
007:007 "Ask, and it will be given you.  Seek, and you will find.
        Knock, and it will be opened for you.
007:008 For everyone who asks receives.  He who seeks finds.
        To him who knocks it will be opened.
007:009 Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread,
        will give him a stone?
007:010 Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?
007:011 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to
        your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven
        give good things to those who ask him!
007:012 Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall
        also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
007:013 "Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad
        is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who
        enter in by it.
007:014 How{TR reads "Because" instead of "How"} narrow is the gate,
        and restricted is the way that leads to life!
        Few are those who find it.
007:015 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing,
        but inwardly are ravening wolves.
007:016 By their fruits you will know them.  Do you gather grapes
        from thorns, or figs from thistles?
007:017 Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt
        tree produces evil fruit.
007:018 A good tree can't produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
        tree produce good fruit.
007:019 Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown
        into the fire.
007:020 Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.
007:021 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into
        the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father
        who is in heaven.
007:022 Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy
        in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name
        do many mighty works?'
007:023 Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you.  Depart from me,
        you who work iniquity.'
007:024 "Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them,
        I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.
007:025 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew,
        and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded
        on the rock.
007:026 Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them
        will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.
007:027 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew,
        and beat on that house; and it fell--and great was its fall."
007:028 It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things,
        that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
007:029 for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.
008:001 When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
008:002 Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, "Lord,
        if you want to, you can make me clean."
008:003 Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to.
        Be made clean."  Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
008:004 Jesus said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself
        to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
        as a testimony to them."
008:005 When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,
008:006 and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed,
        grievously tormented."
008:007 Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
008:008 The centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come
        under my roof.  Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
008:009 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers.
        I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,'
        and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed,
        "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith,
        not even in Israel.
008:011 I tell you that many will come from the east and the west,
        and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
        Kingdom of Heaven,
008:012 but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the
        outer darkness.  There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
008:013 Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way.  Let it be done
        for you as you have believed."  His servant was healed
        in that hour.
008:014 When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother
        lying sick with a fever.
008:015 He touched her hand, and the fever left her.  She got up
        and served him.{TR reads "them" instead of "him"}
008:016 When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons.
        He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
008:017 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
        the prophet, saying:  "He took our infirmities, and bore
        our diseases."{Isaiah 53:4}
008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave
        the order to depart to the other side.
008:019 A scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you
        wherever you go."
008:020 Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky
        have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
008:021 Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first
        to go and bury my father."
008:022 But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury
        their own dead."
008:023 When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
008:024 Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat
        was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.
008:025 They came to him, and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord!
        We are dying!"
008:026 He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?"
        Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was
        a great calm.
008:027 The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this,
        that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
008:028 When he came to the other side, into the country of the
        Gergesenes,{NU reads "Gadarenes"} two people possessed by demons
        met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce,
        so that nobody could pass that way.
008:029 Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do
        with you, Jesus, Son of God?  Have you come here to torment
        us before the time?"
008:030 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
008:031 The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us
        to go away into the herd of pigs."
008:032 He said to them, "Go!"  They came out, and went into the herd
        of pigs:  and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down
        the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
008:033 Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city,
        and told everything, including what happened to those who were
        possessed with demons.
008:034 Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus.  When they saw him,
        they begged that he would depart from their borders.
009:001 He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into
        his own city.
009:002 Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed.
        Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, cheer up!
        Your sins are forgiven you."
009:003 Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves,
        "This man blasphemes."
009:004 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil
        in your hearts?
009:005 For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;'
        or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'
009:006 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on
        earth to forgive sins..." (then he said to the paralytic),
        "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house."
009:007 He arose and departed to his house.
009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God,
        who had given such authority to men.
009:009 As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting
        at the tax collection office.  He said to him, "Follow me."
        He got up and followed him.
009:010 It happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors
        and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
009:011 When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples,
        "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
009:012 When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy
        have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
009:013 But you go and learn what this means:  'I desire mercy, and not
        sacrifice,'{Hosea 6:6} for I came not to call the righteous,
        but sinners to repentance.{NU omits "to repentance".}"
009:014 Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and
        the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"
009:015 Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn,
        as long as the bridegroom is with them?  But the days
        will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them,
        and then they will fast.
009:016 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment;
        for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse
        hole is made.
009:017 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins,
        or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled,
        and the skins ruined.  No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins,
        and both are preserved."
009:018 While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came
        and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter has just died,
        but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
009:019 Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
009:020 Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came
        behind him, and touched the fringe{or, tassel} of his garment;
009:021 for she said within herself, "If I just touch his garment,
        I will be made well."
009:022 But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Daughter, cheer up!
        Your faith has made you well."  And the woman was made well
        from that hour.
009:023 When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players,
        and the crowd in noisy disorder,
009:024 he said to them, "Make room, because the girl isn't dead,
        but sleeping."  They were ridiculing him.
009:025 But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand,
        and the girl arose.
009:026 The report of this went out into all that land.
009:027 As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him,
        calling out and saying, "Have mercy on us, son of David!"
009:028 When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him.
        Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
        They told him, "Yes, Lord."
009:029 Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith
        be it done to you."
009:030 Their eyes were opened.  Jesus strictly charged them, saying,
        "See that no one knows about this."
009:031 But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
009:032 As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed
        was brought to him.
009:033 When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke.
        The multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever
        been seen in Israel!"
009:034 But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of the demons,
        he casts out demons."
009:035 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in
        their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom,
        and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
        for them, because they were harassed{TR reads "weary" instead of
        "harassed"} and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
009:037 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest indeed is plentiful,
        but the laborers are few.
009:038 Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out
        laborers into his harvest."
010:001 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them
        authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal
        every disease and every sickness.
010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these.
        The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother;
        James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;
010:003 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector;
        James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, whose surname was{NU
        omits "Lebbaeus, whose surname was"} Thaddaeus;
010:004 Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
010:005 Jesus sent these twelve out, and charged them, saying,
        "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter into any city
        of the Samaritans.
010:006 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
010:007 As you go, preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers{TR adds ", raise the dead"},
        and cast out demons.  Freely you received, so freely give.
010:009 Don't take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.
010:010 Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes,
        nor staff:  for the laborer is worthy of his food.
010:011 Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it
        is worthy; and stay there until you go on.
010:012 As you enter into the household, greet it.
010:013 If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it,
        but if it isn't worthy, let your peace return to you.
010:014 Whoever doesn't receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out
        of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.
010:015 Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land
        of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
010:016 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.
        Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
010:017 But beware of men:  for they will deliver you up to councils,
        and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
010:018 Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake,
        for a testimony to them and to the nations.
010:019 But when they deliver you up, don't be anxious how or what you
        will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.
010:020 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father
        who speaks in you.
010:021 "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child.
        Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be
        put to death.
010:022 You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who
        endures to the end will be saved.
010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next,
        for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through
        the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.
010:024 "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher,
        and the servant like his lord.  If they have called the master
        of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
010:026 Therefore don't be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered
        that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.
010:027 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you
        hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
010:028 Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able
        to kill the soul.  Rather, fear him who is able to destroy
        both soul and body in Gehenna.{or, Hell.}
010:029 "Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin{An assarion is a small
        coin worth one tenth of a drachma or a sixteenth of a denarius
        (approximately the wages of one half hour of agricultural labor).}?
        Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,
010:030 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
010:031 Therefore don't be afraid.  You are of more value than many sparrows.
010:032 Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will
        also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
010:033 But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before
        my Father who is in heaven.
010:034 "Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth.
        I didn't come to send peace, but a sword.
010:035 For I came to set a man at odds against his father,
        and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law
        against her mother-in-law.
010:036 A man's foes will be those of his own household.{Micah 7:6}
010:037 He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me;
        and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn't worthy of me.
010:038 He who doesn't take his cross and follow after me,
        isn't worthy of me.
010:039 He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life
        for my sake will find it.
010:040 He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives
        him who sent me.
010:041 He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive
        a prophet's reward:  and he who receives a righteous man in the name
        of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.
010:042 Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold
        water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I
        tell you he will in no way lose his reward."
011:001 It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his
        twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach
        in their cities.
011:002 Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ,
        he sent two of his disciples
011:003 and said to him, "Are you he who comes, or should we
        look for another?"
011:004 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you
        hear and see:
011:005 the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers
        are cleansed, the deaf hear,{Isaiah 35:5} the dead are raised up,
        and the poor have good news preached to them.{Isaiah 61:1-4}
011:006 Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me."
011:007 As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes
        concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see?
        A reed shaken by the wind?
011:008 But what did you go out to see?  A man in soft clothing?
        Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king's houses.
011:009 But why did you go out?  To see a prophet?  Yes, I tell you,
        and much more than a prophet.
011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send
        my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way
        before you.'{Malachi 3:1}
011:011 Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women
        there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer;
        yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
011:012 From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom
        of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it
        by force.{or, plunder it.}
011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
011:014 If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.
011:015 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
011:016 "But to what shall I compare this generation?  It is like children
        sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
011:017 and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance.
        We mourned for you, and you didn't lament.'
011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,
        'He has a demon.'
011:019 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold,
        a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
        and sinners!'  But wisdom is justified by her children.{NU
        reads "actions" instead of "children"}"
011:020 Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty
        works had been done, because they didn't repent.
011:021 "Woe to you, Chorazin!  Woe to you, Bethsaida!  For if the mighty
        works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you,
        they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
011:022 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
        on the day of judgment than for you.
011:023 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down
        to Hades.{or, Hell} For if the mighty works had been done
        in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained
        until this day.
011:024 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land
        of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you."
011:025 At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Father, Lord of
        heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise
        and understanding, and revealed them to infants.
011:026 Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
011:027 All things have been delivered to me by my Father.
        No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone
        know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son
        desires to reveal him.
011:028 "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened,
        and I will give you rest.
011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle
        and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
012:001 At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields.
        His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain
        and to eat.
012:002 But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, "Behold,
        your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
012:003 But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did,
        when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
012:004 how he entered into the house of God, and ate the show bread,
        which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who
        were with him, but only for the priests?{1 Samuel 21:3-6}
012:005 Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day,
        the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
012:006 But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
012:007 But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not
        sacrifice,'{Hosea 6:6} you would not have condemned the guiltless.
012:008 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
012:009 He departed there, and went into their synagogue.
012:010 And behold there was a man with a withered hand.
        They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?"
        that they might accuse him.
012:011 He said to them, "What man is there among you, who has one sheep,
        and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day,
        won't he grab on to it, and lift it out?
012:012 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep!
        Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day."
012:013 Then he told the man, "Stretch out your hand."  He stretched it out;
        and it was restored whole, just like the other.
012:014 But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him,
        how they might destroy him.
012:015 Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there.  Great multitudes
        followed him; and he healed them all,
012:016 and charged them that they should not make him known:
012:017 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
        the prophet, saying,
012:018 "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom
        my soul is well pleased:  I will put my Spirit on him.
        He will proclaim justice to the nations.
012:019 He will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his
        voice in the streets.
012:020 He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a smoking flax,
        until he leads justice to victory.
012:021 In his name, the nations will hope."{Isaiah 42:1-4}
012:022 Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought
        to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man
        both spoke and saw.
012:023 All the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Can this be
        the son of David?"
012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This man does not cast
        out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
012:025 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom
        divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every
        city or house divided against itself will not stand.
012:026 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself.
        How then will his kingdom stand?
012:027 If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children
        cast them out?  Therefore they will be your judges.
012:028 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom
        of God has come upon you.
012:029 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man,
        and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man?
        Then he will plunder his house.
012:030 "He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn't gather
        with me, scatters.
012:031 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men,
        but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.
012:032 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be
        forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit,
        it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that
        which is to come.
012:033 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make
        the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known
        by its fruit.
012:034 You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things?
        For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
012:035 The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things,
        and the evil man out of his evil treasure{TR adds "of
        the heart"} brings out evil things.
012:036 I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give
        account of it in the day of judgment.
012:037 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words
        you will be condemned."
012:038 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, "Teacher,
        we want to see a sign from you."
012:039 But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks
        after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign
        of Jonah the prophet.
012:040 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly
        of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three
        nights in the heart of the earth.
012:041 The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation,
        and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah;
        and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.
012:042 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment
        with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came
        from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
        and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.
012:043 But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man,
        passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesn't find it.
012:044 Then he says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,'
        and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept,
        and put in order.
012:045 Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits
        more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there.
        The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
        Even so will it be also to this evil generation."
012:046 While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother
        and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
012:047 One said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers
        stand outside, seeking to speak to you."
012:048 But he answered him who spoke to him, "Who is my mother?
        Who are my brothers?"
012:049 He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said,
        "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
012:050 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven,
        he is my brother, and sister, and mother."
013:001 On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
013:002 Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat,
        and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
013:003 He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold,
        a farmer went out to sow.
013:004 As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds
        came and devoured them.
013:005 Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil,
        and immediately they sprang up, because they had no
        depth of earth.
013:006 When the sun had risen, they were scorched.  Because they
        had no root, they withered away.
013:007 Others fell among thorns.  The thorns grew up and choked them:
013:008 and others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit:
        some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
013:009 He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
013:010 The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak
        to them in parables?"
013:011 He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries
        of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
013:012 For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance,
        but whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even
        that which he has.
013:013 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see,
        and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand.
013:014 In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,
        'By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand;
        Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive:
013:015 for this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are dull
        of hearing, they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps
        they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears,
        understand with their heart, and should turn again;
        and I would heal them.'{Isaiah 6:9-10}
013:016 "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears,
        for they hear.
013:017 For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men
        desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them;
        and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them.
013:018 "Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.
013:019 When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it,
        the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been
        sown in his heart.  This is what was sown by the roadside.
013:020 What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word,
        and immediately with joy receives it;
013:021 yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while.
        When oppression or persecution arises because of the word,
        immediately he stumbles.
013:022 What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word,
        but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches
        choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
013:023 What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word,
        and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit,
        and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty,
        and some thirty."
013:024 He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom
        of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,
013:025 but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds{darnel
        is a weed grass (probably bearded darnel or lolium temulentum)
        that looks very much like wheat until it is mature,
        when the difference becomes very apparent.} also among the wheat,
        and went away.
013:026 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit,
        then the darnel weeds appeared also.
013:027 The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir,
        didn't you sow good seed in your field?  Where did this
        darnel come from?'
013:028 "He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.'  "The servants
        asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
013:029 "But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds,
        you root up the wheat with them.
013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time
        I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds,
        and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat
        into my barn."'"
013:031 He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom
        of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
        and sowed in his field;
013:032 which indeed is smaller than all seeds.  But when it is grown,
        it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that
        the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."
013:033 He spoke another parable to them.  "The Kingdom of Heaven is
        like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures{literally,
        three sata.  3 sata is about 39 litres or a bit more than
        a bushel} of meal, until it was all leavened."
013:034 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes;
        and without a parable, he didn't speak to them,
013:035 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet,
        saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
        hidden from the foundation of the world."{Psalm 78:2}
013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house.
        His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable
        of the darnel weeds of the field."
013:037 He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
013:038 the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children
        of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children
        of the evil one.
013:039 The enemy who sowed them is the devil.  The harvest is the end
        of the age, and the reapers are angels.
013:040 As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire;
        so will it be at the end of this age.
013:041 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will
        gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling,
        and those who do iniquity,
013:042 and will cast them into the furnace of fire.  There will be
        weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
013:043 Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom
        of their Father.  He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
013:044 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden
        in the field, which a man found, and hid.  In his joy,
        he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
013:045 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant
        seeking fine pearls,
013:046 who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold
        all that he had, and bought it.
013:047 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast
        into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,
013:048 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach.
        They sat down, and gathered the good into containers,
        but the bad they threw away.
013:049 So will it be in the end of the world.  The angels will come forth,
        and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
013:050 and will cast them into the furnace of fire.  There will be
        the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
013:051 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?"
        They answered him, "Yes, Lord."
013:052 He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple
        in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder,
        who brings out of his treasure new and old things."
013:053 It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables,
        he departed from there.
013:054 Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue,
        so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man
        get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
013:055 Isn't this the carpenter's son?  Isn't his mother called Mary,
        and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas{or, Judah}?
013:056 Aren't all of his sisters with us?  Where then did this man
        get all of these things?"
013:057 They were offended by him.  But Jesus said to them,
        "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country,
        and in his own house."
013:058 He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
014:001 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
014:002 and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer.
        He is risen from the dead.  That is why these powers
        work in him."
014:003 For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him
        in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
014:004 For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
014:005 When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
        because they counted him as a prophet.
014:006 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced
        among them and pleased Herod.
014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever
        she should ask.
014:008 She, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on
        a platter the head of John the Baptizer."
014:009 The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths,
        and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it
        to be given,
014:010 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
014:011 His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady:
        and she brought it to her mother.
014:012 His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it;
        and they went and told Jesus.
014:013 Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat,
        to a deserted place apart.  When the multitudes heard it,
        they followed him on foot from the cities.
014:014 Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude.  He had compassion
        on them, and healed their sick.
014:015 When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying,
        "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late.
        Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages,
        and buy themselves food."
014:016 But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away.
        You give them something to eat."
014:017 They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."
014:018 He said, "Bring them here to me."
014:019 He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took
        the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven,
        he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples,
        and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
014:020 They all ate, and were filled.  They took up twelve baskets
        full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.
014:021 Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women
        and children.
014:022 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat,
        and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent
        the multitudes away.
014:023 After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into
        the mountain by himself to pray.  When evening had come,
        he was there alone.
014:024 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by
        the waves, for the wind was contrary.
014:025 In the fourth watch of the night,{The night was equally divided
        into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00
        A. M. to sunrise.} Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
014:026 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled,
        saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.
014:027 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up!
        It is I!{or, I AM!} Don't be afraid."
014:028 Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me
        to come to you on the waters."
014:029 He said, "Come!"  Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked
        on the waters to come to Jesus.
014:030 But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid,
        and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
014:031 Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him,
        and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
014:032 When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
014:033 Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying,
        "You are truly the Son of God!"
014:034 When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
014:035 When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all
        that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,
014:036 and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe{or,
        tassel} of his garment.  As many as touched it were made whole.
015:001 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
015:002 "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders?
        For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread."
015:003 He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment
        of God because of your tradition?
015:004 For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,'{Exodus 20:12;
        Deuteronomy 5:16} and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother,
        let him be put to death.'{Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9}
015:005 But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother,
        "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is
        a gift devoted to God,"
015:006 he shall not honor his father or mother.'  You have made
        the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
015:007 You hypocrites!  Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
015:008 'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me
        with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
015:009 And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules
        made by men.'"{Isaiah 29:13}
015:010 He summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.
015:011 That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man;
        but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."
015:012 Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that
        the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"
015:013 But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't
        plant will be uprooted.
015:014 Leave them alone.  They are blind guides of the blind.
        If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."
015:015 Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."
015:016 So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?
015:017 Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes
        into the belly, and then out of the body?
015:018 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart,
        and they defile the man.
015:019 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
        sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
015:020 These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with
        unwashed hands doesn't defile the man."
015:021 Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region
        of Tyre and Sidon.
015:022 Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders,
        and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son
        of David!  My daughter is severely demonized!"
015:023 But he answered her not a word.  His disciples came and
        begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."
015:024 But he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep
        of the house of Israel."
015:025 But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me."
015:026 But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's
        bread and throw it to the dogs."
015:027 But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs
        which fall from their masters' table."
015:028 Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith!
        Be it done to you even as you desire."  And her daughter
        was healed from that hour.
015:029 Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee;
        and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
015:030 Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind,
        mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet.
        He healed them,
015:031 so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking,
        injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they
        glorified the God of Israel.
015:032 Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on
        the multitude, because they continue with me now three days
        and have nothing to eat.  I don't want to send them away fasting,
        or they might faint on the way."
015:033 The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves
        in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
015:034 Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"
        They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
015:035 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
015:036 and he took the seven loaves and the fish.  He gave thanks
        and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples
        to the multitudes.
015:037 They all ate, and were filled.  They took up seven baskets
        full of the broken pieces that were left over.
015:038 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
015:039 Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came
        into the borders of Magdala.
016:001 The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him
        to show them a sign from heaven.
016:002 But he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will
        be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
016:003 In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky
        is red and threatening.'  Hypocrites!  You know how to discern
        the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs
        of the times!
016:004 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there
        will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
        He left them, and departed.
016:005 The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten
        to take bread.
016:006 Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast
        of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
016:007 They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."
016:008 Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves,
        you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
016:009 Don't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves
        for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
016:010 Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets
        you took up?
016:011 How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak
        to you concerning bread?  But beware of the yeast of the
        Pharisees and Sadducees."
016:012 Then they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast
        of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
016:013 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi,
        he asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I,
        the Son of Man, am?"
016:014 They said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others,
        Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
016:015 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
016:016 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of
        the living God."
016:017 Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah,
        for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father
        who is in heaven.
016:018 I also tell you that you are Peter,{Peter's name, Petros in Greek,
        is the word for a specific rock or stone.} and on this rock{Greek,
        petra, a rock mass or bedrock.} I will build my assembly,
        and the gates of Hades{or, Hell} will not prevail against it.
016:019 I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever
        you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever
        you release on earth will have been released in heaven."
016:020 Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no one
        that he is Jesus the Christ.
016:021 From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must
        go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders,
        chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day
        be raised up.
016:022 Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be
        it from you, Lord!  This will never be done to you."
016:023 But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan!  You are
        a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind
        on the things of God, but on the things of men."
016:024 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone desires to come
        after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,
        and follow me.
016:025 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever
        will lose his life for my sake will find it.
016:026 For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world,
        and forfeits his life?  Or what will a man give in exchange
        for his life?
016:027 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with
        his angels, and then he will render to everyone according
        to his deeds.
016:028 Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who
        will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man
        coming in his Kingdom."
017:001 After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John
        his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
017:002 He was transfigured before them.  His face shone like the sun,
        and his garments became as white as the light.
017:003 Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
017:004 Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us
        to be here.  If you want, let's make three tents here:
        one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
017:005 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud
        overshadowed them.  Behold, a voice came out of the cloud,
        saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
        Listen to him."
017:006 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces,
        and were very afraid.
017:007 Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
017:008 Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
017:009 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them,
        saying, "Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man
        has risen from the dead."
017:010 His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say
        that Elijah must come first?"
017:011 Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will
        restore all things,
017:012 but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't
        recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to.
        Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them."
017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of
        John the Baptizer.
017:014 When they came to the multitude, a man came to him,
        kneeling down to him, saying,
017:015 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic,
        and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire,
        and often into the water.
017:016 So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."
017:017 Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation!
        How long will I be with you?  How long will I bear with you?
        Bring him here to me."
017:018 Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy
        was cured from that hour.
017:019 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said,
        "Why weren't we able to cast it out?"
017:020 He said to them, "Because of your unbelief.  For most certainly
        I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'
        and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
017:021 But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."
017:022 While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son
        of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
017:023 and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up."
        They were exceedingly sorry.
017:024 When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma
        coins{A didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas,
        about as much as 2 Roman denarii, or about 2 days' wages.
        It was commonly used to pay the half-shekel temple tax,
        because 2 drachmas were worth one half shekel of silver.} came
        to Peter, and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?"
017:025 He said, "Yes." When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him,
        saying, "What do you think, Simon?  From whom do the kings
        of the earth receive toll or tribute?  From their children,
        or from strangers?"
017:026 Peter said to him, "From strangers."  Jesus said to him,
        "Therefore the children are exempt.
017:027 But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea,
        cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up.
        When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater
        coin.{A stater is a silver coin equivalent to four
        Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas, or a Jewish shekel:
        just exactly enough to cover the half-shekel temple tax for two
        people.} Take that, and give it to them for me and you."
018:001 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then
        is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"
018:002 Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the
        midst of them,
018:003 and said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn,
        and become as little children, you will in no way enter
        into the Kingdom of Heaven.
018:004 Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child,
        the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
018:005 Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
018:006 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me
        to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone
        should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk
        in the depths of the sea.
018:007 "Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling!
        For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person
        through whom the occasion comes!
018:008 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off,
        and cast it from you.  It is better for you to enter into life
        maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet
        to be cast into the eternal fire.
018:009 If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast
        it from you.  It is better for you to enter into life
        with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into
        the Gehenna{or, Hell} of fire.
018:010 See that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I
        tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face
        of my Father who is in heaven.
018:011 For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
018:012 "What do you think?  If a man has one hundred sheep,
        and one of them goes astray, doesn't he leave the ninety-nine,
        go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
018:013 If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it
        more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven
        that one of these little ones should perish.
018:015 "If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault
        between you and him alone.  If he listens to you, you have
        gained back your brother.
018:016 But if he doesn't listen, take one or two more with you,
        that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may
        be established.{Deuteronomy 19:15}
018:017 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly.
        If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you
        as a Gentile or a tax collector.
018:018 Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth
        will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you
        release on earth will have been released in heaven.
018:019 Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree
        on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be
        done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name,
        there I am in the midst of them."
018:021 Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often
        shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
        Until seven times?"
018:022 Jesus said to him, "I don't tell you until seven times, but,
        until seventy times seven.
018:023 Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king,
        who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.
018:024 When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed
        him ten thousand talents.{Ten thousand talents represents
        an extremely large sum of money, equivalent to about
        60,000,000 denarii, where one denarius was typical of one day's
        wages for agricultural labor.}
018:025 But because he couldn't pay, his lord commanded him to be sold,
        with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment
        to be made.
018:026 The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him,
        saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'
018:027 The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion,
        released him, and forgave him the debt.
018:028 "But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants,
        who owed him one hundred denarii,{100 denarii was about one
        sixtieth of a talent.} and he grabbed him, and took him
        by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
018:029 "So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him,
        saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you!'
018:030 He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should
        pay back that which was due.
018:031 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were
        exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all
        that was done.
018:032 Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant!
        I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
018:033 Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant,
        even as I had mercy on you?'
018:034 His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors,
        until he should pay all that was due to him.
018:035 So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don't each
        forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds."
019:001 It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed
        from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
019:002 Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
019:003 Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful
        for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
019:004 He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from
        the beginning made them male and female,{Genesis 1:27}
019:005 and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father
        and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall
        become one flesh?'{Genesis 2:24}
019:006 So that they are no more two, but one flesh.  What therefore
        God has joined together, don't let man tear apart."
019:007 They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her
        a bill of divorce, and divorce her?"
019:008 He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts,
        allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it
        has not been so.
019:009 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for
        sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery;
        and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery."
019:010 His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man
        with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."
019:011 But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying,
        but those to whom it is given.
019:012 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their
        mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs
        by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs
        for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake.  He who is able to receive it,
        let him receive it."
019:013 Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay
        his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
019:014 But Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and don't forbid
        them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs
        to ones like these."
019:015 He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.
019:016 Behold, one came to him and said, "Good teacher, what good thing
        shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
019:017 He said to him, "Why do you call me good?  No one is good
        but one, that is, God.  But if you want to enter into life,
        keep the commandments."
019:018 He said to him, "Which ones?"  Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.'
        'You shall not commit adultery.'  'You shall not steal.'
        'You shall not offer false testimony.'
019:019 'Honor your father and mother.'{Exodus 20:12-16;
        Deuteronomy 5:16-20} And, 'You shall love your neighbor
        as yourself.'"{Leviticus 19:18}
019:020 The young man said to him, "All these things I have observed
        from my youth.  What do I still lack?"
019:021 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have,
        and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
        and come, follow me."
019:022 But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad,
        for he was one who had great possessions.
019:023 Jesus said to his disciples, "Most certainly I say to you,
        a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
019:024 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through
        a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the
        Kingdom of God."
019:025 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished,
        saying, "Who then can be saved?"
019:026 Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible,
        but with God all things are possible."
019:027 Then Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything,
        and followed you.  What then will we have?"
019:028 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that you who have
        followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit
        on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones,
        judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
019:029 Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father,
        or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake,
        will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.
019:030 But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.
020:001 "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master
        of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire
        laborers for his vineyard.
020:002 When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius{A denarius
        is a silver Roman coin worth 1/25th of a Roman aureus.
        This was a common wage for a day of farm labor.} a day,
        he sent them into his vineyard.
020:003 He went out about the third hour,{Time was measured from sunrise
        to sunset, so the third hour would be about 9:00 AM.} and saw
        others standing idle in the marketplace.
020:004 To them he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever
        is right I will give you.'  So they went their way.
020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,{noon
        and 3:00 P. M.} and did likewise.
020:006 About the eleventh hour{5:00 PM} he went out, and found
        others standing idle.  He said to them, 'Why do you stand
        here all day idle?'
020:007 "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.'
        "He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and you
        will receive whatever is right.'
020:008 When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to
        his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages,
        beginning from the last to the first.'
020:009 "When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came,
        they each received a denarius.
020:010 When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more;
        and they likewise each received a denarius.
020:011 When they received it, they murmured against the master
        of the household,
020:012 saying, 'These last have spent one hour, and you have made
        them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day
        and the scorching heat!'
020:013 "But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong.
        Didn't you agree with me for a denarius?
020:014 Take that which is yours, and go your way.  It is my desire
        to give to this last just as much as to you.
020:015 Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own?
        Or is your eye evil, because I am good?'
020:016 So the last will be first, and the first last.
        For many are called, but few are chosen."
020:017 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve
        disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
020:018 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man
        will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they
        will condemn him to death,
020:019 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge,
        and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up."
020:020 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons,
        kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.
020:021 He said to her, "What do you want?"  She said to him,
        "Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand,
        and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom."
020:022 But Jesus answered, "You don't know what you are asking.
        Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink,
        and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
        They said to him, "We are able."
020:023 He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be
        baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit
        on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give;
        but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
020:024 When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
020:025 But Jesus summoned them, and said, "You know that the rulers
        of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise
        authority over them.
020:026 It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become
        great among you shall be{TR reads "let him be" instead of "shall
        be"} your servant.
020:027 Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,
020:028 even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve,
        and to give his life as a ransom for many."
020:029 As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
020:030 Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard
        that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us,
        you son of David!"
020:031 The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet,
        but they cried out even more, "Lord, have mercy on us,
        you son of David!"
020:032 Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, "What do you
        want me to do for you?"
020:033 They told him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
020:034 Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes;
        and immediately their eyes received their sight,
        and they followed him.
021:001 When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage,{TR
        & NU read "Bethphage" instead of "Bethsphage"} to the Mount
        of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
021:002 saying to them, "Go into the village that is opposite you,
        and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her.
        Untie them, and bring them to me.
021:003 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,'
        and immediately he will send them."
021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
        through the prophet, saying,
021:005 "Tell the daughter of Zion, behold, your King comes
        to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal
        of a donkey."{Zechariah 9:9}
021:006 The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
021:007 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them;
        and he sat on them.
021:008 A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road.
        Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.
021:009 The multitudes who went before him, and who followed
        kept shouting, "Hosanna{"Hosanna" means "save us" or "help us,
        we pray."} to the son of David!  Blessed is he who comes
        in the name of the Lord!  Hosanna in the highest!"{Psalm 118:26}
021:010 When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up,
        saying, "Who is this?"
021:011 The multitudes said, "This is the prophet, Jesus, from
        Nazareth of Galilee."
021:012 Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who
        sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers'
        tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
021:013 He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called
        a house of prayer,'{Isaiah 56:7} but you have made it a den
        of robbers!"{Jeremiah 7:11}
021:014 The blind and the lame came to him in the temple,
        and he healed them.
021:015 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful
        things that he did, and the children who were crying
        in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David!"
        they were indignant,
021:016 and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?"
        Jesus said to them, "Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth
        of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'"{Psalm 8:2}
021:017 He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany,
        and lodged there.
021:018 Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
021:019 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing
        on it but leaves.  He said to it, "Let there be no fruit
        from you forever!"  Immediately the fig tree withered away.
021:020 When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did
        the fig tree immediately wither away?"
021:021 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, if you
        have faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was
        done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain,
        'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done.
021:022 All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
021:023 When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and
        the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching,
        and said, "By what authority do you do these things?
        Who gave you this authority?"
021:024 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question,
        which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority
        I do these things.
021:025 The baptism of John, where was it from?  From heaven or from men?"
        They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,'
        he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
021:026 But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the multitude, for all hold
        John as a prophet."
021:027 They answered Jesus, and said, "We don't know."
        He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority
        I do these things.
021:028 But what do you think?  A man had two sons, and he came
        to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
021:029 He answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed
        his mind, and went.
021:030 He came to the second, and said the same thing.  He answered,
        'I go, sir,' but he didn't go.
021:031 Which of the two did the will of his father?"  They said to him,
        "The first."  Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you
        that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering
        into the Kingdom of God before you.
021:032 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you
        didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes
        believed him.  When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterward,
        that you might believe him.
021:033 "Hear another parable.  There was a man who was a master
        of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it,
        dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers,
        and went into another country.
021:034 When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
        to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
021:035 The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another,
        and stoned another.
021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first:
        and they treated them the same way.
021:037 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will
        respect my son.'
021:038 But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves,
        'This is the heir.  Come, let's kill him, and seize
        his inheritance.'
021:039 So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard,
        and killed him.
021:040 When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do
        to those farmers?"
021:041 They told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable men,
        and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will
        give him the fruit in its season."
021:042 Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The
        stone which the builders rejected, the same was made
        the head of the corner.  This was from the Lord.
        It is marvelous in our eyes?'{Psalm 118:22-23}
021:043 "Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away
        from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.
021:044 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on
        whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."
021:045 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,
        they perceived that he spoke about them.
021:046 When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes,
        because they considered him to be a prophet.
022:001 Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
022:002 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made
        a marriage feast for his son,
022:003 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited
        to the marriage feast, but they would not come.
022:004 Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those
        who are invited, "Behold, I have made ready my dinner.
        My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready.
        Come to the marriage feast!"'
022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
        own farm, another to his merchandise,
022:006 and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully,
        and killed them.
022:007 When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies,
        destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
022:008 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready,
        but those who were invited weren't worthy.
022:009 Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many
        as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'
022:010 Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
        together as many as they found, both bad and good.
        The wedding was filled with guests.
022:011 But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there
        a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,
022:012 and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not
        wearing wedding clothing?'  He was speechless.
022:013 Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot,
        take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness;
        there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'
022:014 For many are called, but few chosen."
022:015 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap
        him in his talk.
022:016 They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians,
        saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach
        the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you
        aren't partial to anyone.
022:017 Tell us therefore, what do you think?  Is it lawful to pay
        taxes to Caesar, or not?"
022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you
        test me, you hypocrites?
022:019 Show me the tax money."  They brought to him a denarius.
022:020 He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
022:021 They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them,
        "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
        and to God the things that are God's."
022:022 When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.
022:023 On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection)
        came to him.  They asked him,
022:024 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children,
        his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
        for his brother.'
022:025 Now there were with us seven brothers.  The first married and died,
        and having no seed left his wife to his brother.
022:026 In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
022:027 After them all, the woman died.
022:028 In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven?
        For they all had her."
022:029 But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing
        the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given
        in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.
022:031 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read
        that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
022:032 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
        of Jacob?'{Exodus 3:6} God is not the God of the dead,
        but of the living."
022:033 When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
022:034 But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced
        the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
022:035 One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.
022:036 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
022:037 Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God
        with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all
        your mind.'{Deuteronomy 6:5}
022:038 This is the first and great commandment.
022:039 A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor
        as yourself.'{Leviticus 19:18}
022:040 The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."
022:041 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
        them a question,
022:042 saying, "What do you think of the Christ?  Whose son is he?"
        They said to him, "Of David."
022:043 He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call
        him Lord, saying,
022:044 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make
        your enemies a footstool for your feet?'{Psalm 110:1}
022:045 "If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
022:046 No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare
        ask him any more questions from that day forth.
023:001 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
023:002 saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.
023:003 All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe,
        observe and do, but don't do their works; for they say,
        and don't do.
023:004 For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne,
        and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will
        not lift a finger to help them.
023:005 But all their works they do to be seen by men.
        They make their phylacteries{phylacteries (tefillin in Hebrew)
        are small leather pouches that some Jewish men wear on their
        forehead and arm in prayer.  They are used to carry a small
        scroll with some Scripture in it.  See Deuteronomy 6:8.} broad,
        enlarge the fringes{or, tassels} of their garments,
023:006 and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats
        in the synagogues,
023:007 the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called
        'Rabbi, Rabbi' by men.
023:008 But don't you be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your teacher,
        the Christ, and all of you are brothers.
023:009 Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father,
        he who is in heaven.
023:010 Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.
023:011 But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.
023:012 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles
        himself will be exalted.
023:013 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you
        devour widows' houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers.
        Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
023:014 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
        Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men;
        for you don't enter in yourselves, neither do you allow
        those who are entering in to enter.{Some Greek manuscripts
        reverse the order of verses 13 and 14, and some omit verse 13,
        numbering verse 14 as 13.}
023:015 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you
        travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte;
        and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son
        of Gehenna{or, Hell} as yourselves.
023:016 "Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple,
        it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple,
        he is obligated.'
023:017 You blind fools!  For which is greater, the gold, or the temple
        that sanctifies the gold?
023:018 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears
        by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?'
023:019 You blind fools!  For which is greater, the gift, or the altar
        that sanctifies the gift?
023:020 He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by
        everything on it.
023:021 He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was
        living in it.
023:022 He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God,
        and by him who sits on it.
023:023 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you
        tithe mint, dill, and cumin,{ cumin is an aromatic seed from
        Cuminum cyminum, resembling caraway in flavor and appearance.
        It is used as a spice.} and have left undone the weightier
        matters of the law:  justice, mercy, and faith.
        But you ought to have done these, and not to have left
        the other undone.
023:024 You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
023:025 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you clean
        the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are
        full of extortion and unrighteousness.{TR reads "self-indulgence"
        instead of "unrighteousness"}
023:026 You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of
        the platter, that the outside of it may become clean also.
023:027 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you
        are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful,
        but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
023:028 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly
        you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
023:029 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you
        build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs
        of the righteous,
023:030 and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn't
        have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
023:031 Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children
        of those who killed the prophets.
023:032 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
023:033 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape
        the judgment of Gehenna{or, Hell}?
023:034 Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes.
        Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you
        will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
023:035 that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth,
        from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah
        son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary
        and the altar.
023:036 Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come
        upon this generation.
023:037 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones
        those who are sent to her!  How often I would have gathered
        your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks
        under her wings, and you would not!
023:038 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
023:039 For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say,
        'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"{Psalm 118:26}
024:001 Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way.
        His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
024:002 But he answered them, "Don't you see all of these things?
        Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one
        stone on another, that will not be thrown down."
024:003 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to
        him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be?
        What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
024:004 Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.
024:005 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,'
        and will lead many astray.
024:006 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars.  See that you
        aren't troubled, for all this must happen, but the end
        is not yet.
024:007 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
        and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes
        in various places.
024:008 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
024:009 Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you.
        You will be hated by all of the nations for my name's sake.
024:010 Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another,
        and will hate one another.
024:011 Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.
024:012 Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many
        will grow cold.
024:013 But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
024:014 This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world
        for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
024:015 "When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation,{Daniel 9:27;
        11:31; 12:11} which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet,
        standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
024:016 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
024:017 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things
        that are in his house.
024:018 Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.
024:019 But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers
        in those days!
024:020 Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,
024:021 for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been
        from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
024:022 Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved.
        But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.
024:023 "Then if any man tells you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,'
        or, 'There,' don't believe it.
024:024 For there will arise false christs, and false prophets,
        and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray,
        if possible, even the chosen ones.
024:025 "Behold, I have told you beforehand.
024:026 If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,'
        don't go out; 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers,'
        don't believe it.
024:027 For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even
        to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
024:028 For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures{or,
        eagles} gather together.
024:029 But immediately after the oppression of those days,
        the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,
        the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens
        will be shaken;{Isaiah 13:10; 34:4}
024:030 and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky.
        Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see
        the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power
        and great glory.
024:031 He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
        and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds,
        from one end of the sky to the other.
024:032 "Now from the fig tree learn this parable.  When its branch
        has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know
        that the summer is near.
024:033 Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it
        is near, even at the doors.
024:034 Most certainly I tell you, this generation{The word for "generation"
        (genea) can also be translated as "race."} will not pass away,
        until all these things are accomplished.
024:035 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
024:036 But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels
        of heaven, but my Father only.
024:037 "As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
024:038 For as in those days which were before the flood they
        were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
        until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
024:039 and they didn't know until the flood came, and took them all away,
        so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
024:040 Then two men will be in the field:  one will be taken and one
        will be left;
024:041 two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one
        will be left.
024:042 Watch therefore, for you don't know in what hour your Lord comes.
024:043 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what
        watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched,
        and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
024:044 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don't expect,
        the Son of Man will come.
024:045 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has
        set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
024:046 Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.
024:047 Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all
        that he has.
024:048 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, 'My lord
        is delaying his coming,'
024:049 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink
        with the drunkards,
024:050 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn't
        expect it, and in an hour when he doesn't know it,
024:051 and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with
        the hypocrites.  There is where the weeping and grinding
        of teeth will be.
025:001 "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins,
        who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.
025:002 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
025:003 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no
        oil with them,
025:004 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
025:005 Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
025:006 But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold!  The bridegroom is coming!
        Come out to meet him!'
025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.{The end
        of the wick of an oil lamp needs to be cut off periodically
        to avoid having it become clogged with carbon deposits.
        The wick height is also adjusted so that the flame burns evenly
        and gives good light without producing a lot of smoke.}
025:008 The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil,
        for our lamps are going out.'
025:009 But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there isn't
        enough for us and you?  You go rather to those who sell,
        and buy for yourselves.'
025:010 While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those
        who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast,
        and the door was shut.
025:011 Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord,
        open to us.'
025:012 But he answered, 'Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.'
025:013 Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour
        in which the Son of Man is coming.
025:014 "For it is like a man, going into another country, who called
        his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.
025:015 To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one;
        to each according to his own ability.  Then he went
        on his journey.
025:016 Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded
        with them, and made another five talents.
025:017 In like manner he also who got the two gained another two.
025:018 But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth,
        and hid his lord's money.
025:019 "Now after a long time the lord of those servants came,
        and reconciled accounts with them.
025:020 He who received the five talents came and brought another
        five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents.
        Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.'
025:021 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.
        You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you
        over many things.  Enter into the joy of your lord.'
025:022 "He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord,
        you delivered to me two talents.  Behold, I have gained
        another two talents besides them.'
025:023 "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.
        You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you
        over many things.  Enter into the joy of your lord.'
025:024 "He also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew
        you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow,
        and gathering where you did not scatter.
025:025 I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth.
        Behold, you have what is yours.'
025:026 "But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant.
        You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where
        I didn't scatter.
025:027 You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers,
        and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.
025:028 Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him
        who has the ten talents.
025:029 For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance,
        but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will
        be taken away.
025:030 Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness,
        where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
025:031 "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy
        angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
025:032 Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate
        them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep
        from the goats.
025:033 He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats
        on the left.
025:034 Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come,
        blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
        from the foundation of the world;
025:035 for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty,
        and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;
025:036 naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me;
        I was in prison, and you came to me.'
025:037 "Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we
        see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
025:038 When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked,
        and clothe you?
025:039 When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
025:040 "The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you,
        inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my
        brothers{The word for "brothers" here may be also correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}, you did
        it to me.'
025:041 Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me,
        you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil
        and his angels;
025:042 for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat;
        I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
025:043 I was a stranger, and you didn't take me in; naked, and you didn't
        clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn't visit me.'
025:044 "Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see
        you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
        or in prison, and didn't help you?'
025:045 "Then he will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell you,
        inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these,
        you didn't do it to me.'
025:046 These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous
        into eternal life."
026:001 It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words,
        that he said to his disciples,
026:002 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming,
        and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
026:003 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people
        were gathered together in the court of the high priest,
        who was called Caiaphas.
026:004 They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit,
        and kill him.
026:005 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur
        among the people."
026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
026:007 a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very
        expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat
        at the table.
026:008 But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying,
        "Why this waste?
026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given
        to the poor."
026:010 However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why do you trouble
        the woman?  Because she has done a good work for me.
026:011 For you always have the poor with you; but you don't
        always have me.
026:012 For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare
        me for burial.
026:013 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached
        in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be
        spoken of as a memorial of her."
026:014 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,
        went to the chief priests,
026:015 and said, "What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver
        him to you?"  They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
026:016 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
026:017 Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came
        to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare
        for you to eat the Passover?"
026:018 He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him,
        'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand.  I will keep the Passover
        at your house with my disciples."'"
026:019 The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they
        prepared the Passover.
026:020 Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table
        with the twelve disciples.
026:021 As they were eating, he said, "Most certainly I tell you
        that one of you will betray me."
026:022 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him,
        "It isn't me, is it, Lord?"
026:023 He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish,
        the same will betray me.
026:024 The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe
        to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed!
        It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
026:025 Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn't me,
        is it, Rabbi?"  He said to him, "You said it."
026:026 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for{TR
        reads "blessed" instead of "gave thanks for"} it, and broke it.
        He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
026:027 He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of
        you drink it,
026:028 for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured
        out for many for the remission of sins.
026:029 But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine
        from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you
        in my Father's Kingdom."
026:030 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
026:031 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because
        of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd,
        and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'{Zechariah 13:7}
026:032 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
026:033 But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble
        because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
026:034 Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight,
        before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
026:035 Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not
        deny you."  All of the disciples also said likewise.
026:036 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said
        to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
026:037 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began
        to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
026:038 Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,
        even to death.  Stay here, and watch with me."
026:039 He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying,
        "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me;
        nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
026:040 He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said
        to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?
026:041 Watch and pray, that you don't enter into temptation.
        The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
026:042 Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father,
        if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it,
        your desire be done."
026:043 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
026:044 He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time,
        saying the same words.
026:045 Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now,
        and take your rest.  Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son
        of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
026:046 Arise, let's be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
026:047 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve,
        came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs,
        from the chief priest and elders of the people.
026:048 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss,
        he is the one.  Seize him."
026:049 Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!"
        and kissed him.
026:050 Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?"  Then they came
        and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
026:051 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand,
        and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest,
        and struck off his ear.
026:052 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place,
        for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
026:053 Or do you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would
        even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
026:054 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"
026:055 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come
        out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me?
        I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.
026:056 But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets
        might be fulfilled."  Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
026:057 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest,
        where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
026:058 But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of
        the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers,
        to see the end.
026:059 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council
        sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put
        him to death;
026:060 and they found none.  Even though many false witnesses came forward,
        they found none.  But at last two false witnesses came forward,
026:061 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God,
        and to build it in three days.'"
026:062 The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no answer?
        What is this that these testify against you?"
026:063 But Jesus held his peace.  The high priest answered him,
        "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether
        you are the Christ, the Son of God."
026:064 Jesus said to him, "You have said it.  Nevertheless, I tell you,
        after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right
        hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
026:065 Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has
        spoken blasphemy!  Why do we need any more witnesses?
        Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
026:066 What do you think?"  They answered, "He is worthy of death!"
026:067 Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists,
        and some slapped him,
026:068 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ!  Who hit you?"
026:069 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came
        to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
026:070 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you
        are talking about."
026:071 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him,
        and said to those who were there, "This man also was with
        Jesus of Nazareth."
026:072 Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."
026:073 After a little while those who stood by came and said
        to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech
        makes you known."
026:074 Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!"
        Immediately the rooster crowed.
026:075 Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him,
        "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
        He went out and wept bitterly.
027:001 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders
        of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
027:002 and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up
        to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
027:003 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned,
        felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver
        to the chief priests and elders,
027:004 saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."
        But they said, "What is that to us?  You see to it."
027:005 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed.
        He went away and hanged himself.
027:006 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said,
        "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it
        is the price of blood."
027:007 They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them,
        to bury strangers in.
027:008 Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood"
        to this day.
027:009 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah{some manuscripts
        omit "Jeremaiah"} the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "They took
        the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price
        had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced,
027:010 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded
        me."{Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9}
027:011 Now Jesus stood before the governor:  and the governor asked him,
        saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  Jesus said to him,
        "So you say."
027:012 When he was accused by the chief priests and elders,
        he answered nothing.
027:013 Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many things they
        testify against you?"
027:014 He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the
        governor marveled greatly.
027:015 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release
        to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
027:016 They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
027:017 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them,
        "Whom do you want me to release to you?  Barabbas, or Jesus,
        who is called Christ?"
027:018 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
027:019 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent
        to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man,
        for I have suffered many things this day in a dream
        because of him."
027:020 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes
        to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
027:021 But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want
        me to release to you?"  They said, "Barabbas!"
027:022 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is
        called Christ?"  They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
027:023 But the governor said, "Why?  What evil has he done?"
        But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"
027:024 So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained,
        but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water,
        and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am
        innocent of the blood of this righteous person.
        You see to it."
027:025 All the people answered, "May his blood be on us,
        and on our children!"
027:026 Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged
        and delivered to be crucified.
027:027 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium,
        and gathered the whole garrison together against him.
027:028 They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
027:029 They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head,
        and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him,
        and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
027:030 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
027:031 When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him,
        and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
027:032 As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name,
        and they compelled him to go with them, that he might
        carry his cross.
027:033 They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say,
        "The place of a skull."
027:034 They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall.
        When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
027:035 When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them,
        casting lots,{TR adds "that it might be fulfilled which was
        spoken by the prophet:  'They divided my garments among them,
        and for my clothing they cast lots;'" [see Psalm 22:18
        and John 19:24]}
027:036 and they sat and watched him there.
027:037 They set up over his head the accusation against him written,
        "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
027:038 Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his
        right hand and one on the left.
027:039 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
027:040 and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it
        in three days, save yourself!  If you are the Son of God,
        come down from the cross!"
027:041 Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes,
        the Pharisees,{TR omits "the Pharisees"} and the elders, said,
027:042 "He saved others, but he can't save himself.  If he is
        the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now,
        and we will believe in him.
027:043 He trusts in God.  Let God deliver him now, if he wants him;
        for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
027:044 The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him
        the same reproach.
027:045 Now from the sixth hour{noon} there was darkness over all
        the land until the ninth hour.{3:00 P. M.}
027:046 About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
        "Eli, Eli, lima{TR reads "lama" instead of "lima"} sabachthani?"
        That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"{Psalm 22:1}
027:047 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man
        is calling Elijah."
027:048 Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it
        with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
027:049 The rest said, "Let him be.  Let's see whether Elijah comes
        to save him."
027:050 Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
027:051 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top
        to the bottom.  The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
027:052 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had
        fallen asleep were raised;
027:053 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered
        into the holy city and appeared to many.
027:054 Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus,
        when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done,
        feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."
027:055 Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed
        Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
027:056 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses,
        and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
027:057 When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph,
        who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.
027:058 This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.  Then Pilate
        commanded the body to be given up.
027:059 Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
027:060 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock,
        and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
027:061 Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting
        opposite the tomb.
027:062 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day,
        the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
027:063 saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was
        still alive:  'After three days I will rise again.'
027:064 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day,
        lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away,
        and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last
        deception will be worse than the first."
027:065 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard.  Go, make it as secure
        as you can."
027:066 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure,
        sealing the stone.
028:001 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first
        day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came
        to see the tomb.
028:002 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord
        descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone
        from the door, and sat on it.
028:003 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
028:004 For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
028:005 The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know
        that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
028:006 He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said.
        Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
028:007 Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead,
        and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will
        see him.'  Behold, I have told you."
028:008 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy,
        and ran to bring his disciples word.
028:009 As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
        saying, "Rejoice!"  They came and took hold of his feet,
        and worshiped him.
028:010 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid.  Go tell my
        brothers{The word for "brothers" here may be also correctly
        translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."} that they
        should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."
028:011 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came
        into the city, and told the chief priests all the things
        that had happened.
028:012 When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel,
        they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
028:013 saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him
        away while we slept.
028:014 If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him
        and make you free of worry."
028:015 So they took the money and did as they were told.
        This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues
        until this day.
028:016 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain
        where Jesus had sent them.
028:017 When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
028:018 Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority
        has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
028:019 Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
        in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
028:020 teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you.
        Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."  Amen.
Book 41 Mark
001:001 The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
001:002 As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger
        before your face, who will prepare your way before you.{Malachi 3:1}
001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way
        of the Lord!  Make his paths straight!'"{Isaiah 40:3}
001:004 John came baptizing{or, immersing} in the wilderness and preaching
        the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
001:005 All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went
        out to him.  They were baptized by him in the Jordan river,
        confessing their sins.
001:006 John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around
        his waist.  He ate locusts and wild honey.
001:007 He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier
        than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop
        down and loosen.
001:008 I baptized you in{The Greek word (en) translated here as "in"
        could also be translated as "with" in some contexts.} water,
        but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."
001:009 It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
        of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
001:010 Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting,
        and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
001:011 A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom
        I am well pleased."
001:012 Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
001:013 He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan.
        He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.
001:014 Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee,
        preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,
001:015 and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
        is at hand!  Repent, and believe in the Good News."
001:016 Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
        Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea,
        for they were fishermen.
001:017 Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into
        fishers for men."
001:018 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
001:019 Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son
        of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat
        mending the nets.
001:020 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee,
        in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
001:021 They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day
        he entered into the synagogue and taught.
001:022 They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them
        as having authority, and not as the scribes.
001:023 Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,
        and he cried out,
001:024 saying, "Ha!  What do we have to do with you, Jesus,
        you Nazarene?  Have you come to destroy us?  I know you who you are:
        the Holy One of God!"
001:025 Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
001:026 The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice,
        came out of him.
001:027 They were all amazed, so that they questioned among
        themselves, saying, "What is this?  A new teaching?
        For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits,
        and they obey him!"
001:028 The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all
        the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.
001:029 Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came
        into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
001:030 Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately
        they told him about her.
001:031 He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up.
        The fever left her, and she served them.
001:032 At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all
        who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.
001:033 All the city was gathered together at the door.
001:034 He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast
        out many demons.  He didn't allow the demons to speak,
        because they knew him.
001:035 Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose
        up and went out, and departed into a deserted place,
        and prayed there.
001:036 Simon and those who were with him followed after him;
001:037 and they found him, and told him, "Everyone is looking for you."
001:038 He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I
        may preach there also, because I came out for this reason."
001:039 He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
        preaching and casting out demons.
001:040 A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him,
        and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
001:041 Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand,
        and touched him, and said to him, "I want to.  Be made clean."
001:042 When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him,
        and he was made clean.
001:043 He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
001:044 and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show
        yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things
        which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
001:045 But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread
        about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly
        enter into a city, but was outside in desert places:
        and they came to him from everywhere.
002:001 When he entered again into Capernaum after some days,
        it was heard that he was in the house.
002:002 Immediately many were gathered together, so that there
        was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke
        the word to them.
002:003 Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.
002:004 When they could not come near to him for the crowd,
        they removed the roof where he was.  When they had broken it up,
        they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.
002:005 Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins
        are forgiven you."
002:006 But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning
        in their hearts,
002:007 "Why does this man speak blasphemies like that?
        Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
002:008 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so
        reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason
        these things in your hearts?
002:009 Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;'
        or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?'
002:010 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth
        to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--
002:011 "I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."
002:012 He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went
        out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed,
        and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"
002:013 He went out again by the seaside.  All the multitude came to him,
        and he taught them.
002:014 As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus,
        sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me."
        And he arose and followed him.
002:015 It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house,
        and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and
        his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.
002:016 The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating
        with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples,
        "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
002:017 When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy
        have no need for a physician, but those who are sick.
        I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
002:018 John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came
        and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples
        of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?"
002:019 Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom
        is with them?  As long as they have the bridegroom with them,
        they can't fast.
002:020 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away
        from them, and then will they fast in that day.
002:021 No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment,
        or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old,
        and a worse hole is made.
002:022 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine
        will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins
        will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."
002:023 It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through
        the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went,
        to pluck the ears of grain.
002:024 The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which
        is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"
002:025 He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need,
        and was hungry--he, and those who were with him?
002:026 How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest,
        and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except
        for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"
002:027 He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man
        for the Sabbath.
002:028 Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
003:001 He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there
        who had his hand withered.
003:002 They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day,
        that they might accuse him.
003:003 He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."
003:004 He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to
        do good, or to do harm?  To save a life, or to kill?"
        But they were silent.
003:005 When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved
        at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man,
        "Stretch out your hand."  He stretched it out, and his hand
        was restored as healthy as the other.
003:006 The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the
        Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
003:007 Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great
        multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,
003:008 from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from
        around Tyre and Sidon.  A great multitude, hearing what great
        things he did, came to him.
003:009 He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near
        him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him.
003:010 For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed
        on him that they might touch him.
003:011 The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him,
        and cried, "You are the Son of God!"
003:012 He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
003:013 He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom
        he wanted, and they went to him.
003:014 He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that
        he might send them out to preach,
003:015 and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
003:016 Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;
003:017 James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James,
        and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;
003:018 Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son
        of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
003:019 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  He came into a house.
003:020 The multitude came together again, so that they could not
        so much as eat bread.
003:021 When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him:
        for they said, "He is insane."
003:022 The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul,"
        and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."
003:023 He summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan
        cast out Satan?
003:024 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
003:025 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
003:026 If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided,
        he can't stand, but has an end.
003:027 But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder,
        unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will
        plunder his house.
003:028 Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man
        will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which
        they may blaspheme;
003:029 but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never
        has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"
003:030 --because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."
003:031 His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside,
        they sent to him, calling him.
003:032 A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold,
        your mother, your brothers, and your sisters{TR omits "your
        sisters"} are outside looking for you."
003:033 He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
003:034 Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold,
        my mother and my brothers!
003:035 For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother,
        and my sister, and mother."
004:001 Again he began to teach by the seaside.  A great multitude was
        gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea,
        and sat down.  All the multitude were on the land by the sea.
004:002 He taught them many things in parables, and told them
        in his teaching,
004:003 "Listen!  Behold, the farmer went out to sow,
004:004 and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road,
        and the birds{TR adds "of the air"} came and devoured it.
004:005 Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil,
        and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.
004:006 When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had
        no root, it withered away.
004:007 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up,
        and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
004:008 Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit,
        growing up and increasing.  Some brought forth thirty times,
        some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."
004:009 He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
004:010 When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve
        asked him about the parables.
004:011 He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God,
        but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,
004:012 that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
        may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again,
        and their sins should be forgiven them.'"{Isaiah 6:9-10}
004:013 He said to them, "Don't you understand this parable?
        How will you understand all of the parables?
004:014 The farmer sows the word.
004:015 The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown;
        and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes
        away the word which has been sown in them.
004:016 These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places,
        who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive
        it with joy.
004:017 They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When
        oppression or persecution arises because of the word,
        immediately they stumble.
004:018 Others are those who are sown among the thorns.
        These are those who have heard the word,
004:019 and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches,
        and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word,
        and it becomes unfruitful.
004:020 Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear
        the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times,
        some sixty times, and some one hundred times."
004:021 He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under
        a basket{literally, a modion, a dry measuring basket
        containing about a peck (about 9 litres)} or under a bed?
        Isn't it put on a stand?
004:022 For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known;
        neither was anything made secret, but that it should
        come to light.
004:023 If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
004:024 He said to them, "Take heed what you hear.  With whatever
        measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more
        will be given to you who hear.
004:025 For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have,
        even that which he has will be taken away from him."
004:026 He said, "The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed
        on the earth,
004:027 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should
        spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.
004:028 For the earth bears fruit:  first the blade, then the ear,
        then the full grain in the ear.
004:029 But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle,
        because the harvest has come."
004:030 He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God?  Or with what
        parable will we illustrate it?
004:031 It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown
        in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are
        on the earth,
004:032 yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all
        the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds
        of the sky can lodge under its shadow."
004:033 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they
        were able to hear it.
004:034 Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately
        to his own disciples he explained everything.
004:035 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's go
        over to the other side."
004:036 Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was,
        in the boat.  Other small boats were also with him.
004:037 A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat,
        so much that the boat was already filled.
004:038 He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion,
        and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don't you care
        that we are dying?"
004:039 He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace!
        Be still!"  The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
004:040 He said to them, "Why are you so afraid?  How is it that you
        have no faith?"
004:041 They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then
        is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
005:001 They came to the other side of the sea, into the country
        of the Gadarenes.
005:002 When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him
        out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
005:003 who had his dwelling in the tombs.  Nobody could bind him any more,
        not even with chains,
005:004 because he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
        and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters
        broken in pieces.  Nobody had the strength to tame him.
005:005 Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains,
        he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
005:006 When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
005:007 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do
        with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God?  I adjure you
        by God, don't torment me."
005:008 For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
005:009 He asked him, "What is your name?"  He said to him, "My name
        is Legion, for we are many."
005:010 He begged him much that he would not send them away out
        of the country.
005:011 Now there was on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding.
005:012 All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs,
        that we may enter into them."
005:013 At once Jesus gave them permission.  The unclean spirits came
        out and entered into the pigs.  The herd of about two thousand
        rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned
        in the sea.
005:014 Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
        The people came to see what it was that had happened.
005:015 They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed
        by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him
        who had the legion; and they were afraid.
005:016 Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him
        who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
005:017 They began to beg him to depart from their region.
005:018 As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed
        by demons begged him that he might be with him.
005:019 He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house,
        to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord
        has done for you, and how he had mercy on you."
005:020 He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus
        had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.
005:021 When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side,
        a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
005:022 Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came;
        and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
005:023 and begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at
        the point of death.  Please come and lay your hands on her,
        that she may be made healthy, and live."
005:024 He went with him, and a great multitude followed him,
        and they pressed upon him on all sides.
005:025 A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
005:026 and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent
        all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
005:027 having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him
        in the crowd, and touched his clothes.
005:028 For she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."
005:029 Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt
        in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
005:030 Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had
        gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked,
        "Who touched my clothes?"
005:031 His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing
        against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
005:032 He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
005:033 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been
        done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him
        all the truth.
005:034 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well.
        Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."
005:035 While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue
        ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead.  Why bother
        the Teacher any more?"
005:036 But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said
        to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be afraid, only believe."
005:037 He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John
        the brother of James.
005:038 He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar,
        weeping, and great wailing.
005:039 When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make
        an uproar and weep?  The child is not dead, but is asleep."
005:040 They ridiculed him.  But he, having put them all out,
        took the father of the child and her mother and those who were
        with him, and went in where the child was lying.
005:041 Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi;"
        which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you, get up."
005:042 Immediately the girl rose up, and walked, for she was twelve
        years old.  They were amazed with great amazement.
005:043 He strictly ordered them that no one should know this,
        and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
006:001 He went out from there.  He came into his own country,
        and his disciples followed him.
006:002 When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue,
        and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this
        man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given
        to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
006:003 Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of
        James, Joses, Judah, and Simon?  Aren't his sisters here with us?"
        They were offended at him.
006:004 Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor,
        except in his own country, and among his own relatives,
        and in his own house."
006:005 He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands
        on a few sick people, and healed them.
006:006 He marveled because of their unbelief.  He went around
        the villages teaching.
006:007 He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two
        by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
006:008 He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey,
        except a staff only:  no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,
006:009 but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.
006:010 He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there
        until you depart from there.
006:011 Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart
        from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet
        for a testimony against them.  Assuredly, I tell you,
        it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day
        of judgment than for that city!"
006:012 They went out and preached that people should repent.
006:013 They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick,
        and healed them.
006:014 King Herod heard this, for his name had become known,
        and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead,
        and therefore these powers are at work in him."
006:015 But others said, "It is Elijah."  Others said, "It is the Prophet,
        or like one of the prophets."
006:016 But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded.
        He has risen from the dead."
006:017 For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him
        in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
        for he had married her.
006:018 For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have
        your brother's wife."
006:019 Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him,
        but she couldn't,
006:020 for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man,
        and kept him safe.  When he heard him, he did many things,
        and he heard him gladly.
006:021 Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made
        a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief
        men of Galilee.
006:022 When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced,
        she pleased Herod and those sitting with him.
        The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want,
        and I will give it to you."
006:023 He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you,
        up to half of my kingdom."
006:024 She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"
        She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."
006:025 She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked,
        "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer
        on a platter."
006:026 The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths,
        and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her.
006:027 Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard,
        and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded
        him in the prison,
006:028 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady;
        and the young lady gave it to her mother.
006:029 When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse,
        and laid it in a tomb.
006:030 The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they
        told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever
        they had taught.
006:031 He said to them, "You come apart into a deserted place,
        and rest awhile."  For there were many coming and going,
        and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
006:032 They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
006:033 They{TR reads "The multitudes" instead of "They"} saw them going,
        and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities.
        They arrived before them and came together to him.
006:034 Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion
        on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd,
        and he began to teach them many things.
006:035 When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said,
        "This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country
        and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have
        nothing to eat."
006:037 But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."
        They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii{200
        denarii was about 7 or 8 months wages for an agricultural
        laborer.} worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"
006:038 He said to them, "How many loaves do you have?  Go see."
        When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."
006:039 He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups
        on the green grass.
006:040 They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
006:041 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven,
        he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples
        to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.
006:042 They all ate, and were filled.
006:043 They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also
        of the fish.
006:044 Those who ate the loaves were{TR adds "about"} five thousand men.
006:045 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go
        ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent
        the multitude away.
006:046 After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.
006:047 When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea,
        and he was alone on the land.
006:048 Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary
        to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them,
        walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,
006:049 but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it
        was a ghost, and cried out;
006:050 for they all saw him, and were troubled.  But he immediately
        spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up!
        It is I!{or, "I AM!"} Don't be afraid."
006:051 He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they
        were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;
006:052 for they hadn't understood about the loaves, but their
        hearts were hardened.
006:053 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret,
        and moored to the shore.
006:054 When they had come out of the boat, immediately the
        people recognized him,
006:055 and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those
        who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.
006:056 Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities,
        or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces,
        and begged him that they might touch just the fringe{or,
        tassel} of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.
007:001 Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together
        to him, having come from Jerusalem.
007:002 Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled,
        that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.
007:003 (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they
        wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition
        of the elders.
007:004 They don't eat when they come from the marketplace,
        unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things,
        which they have received to hold to:  washings of cups,
        pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)
007:005 The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don't your
        disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders,
        but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"
007:006 He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,
        as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips,
        but their heart is far from me.
007:007 But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines
        the commandments of men.'{Isaiah 29:13}
007:008 "For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly
        to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups,
        and you do many other such things."
007:009 He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God,
        that you may keep your tradition.
007:010 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;'{Exodus 20:12;
        Deuteronomy 5:16} and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother,
        let him be put to death.'{Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9}
007:011 But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother,
        "Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban{Corban
        is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God.}, that is to say,
        given to God;"'
007:012 then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father
        or his mother,
007:013 making void the word of God by your tradition, which you
        have handed down.  You do many things like this."
007:014 He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,
        "Hear me, all of you, and understand.
007:015 There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him
        can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man
        are those that defile the man.
007:016 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"
007:017 When he had entered into a house away from the multitude,
        his disciples asked him about the parable.
007:018 He said to them, "Are you thus without understanding also?
        Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside
        can't defile him,
007:019 because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach,
        then into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"
007:020 He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.
007:021 For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts,
        adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,
007:022 covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye,
        blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.
007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
007:024 From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre
        and Sidon.  He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone
        to know it, but he couldn't escape notice.
007:025 For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit,
        having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
007:026 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race.
        She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
007:027 But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first,
        for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread
        and throw it to the dogs."
007:028 But she answered him, "Yes, Lord.  Yet even the dogs under
        the table eat the children's crumbs."
007:029 He said to her, "For this saying, go your way.  The demon has
        gone out of your daughter."
007:030 She went away to her house, and found the child having been
        laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.
007:031 Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
        and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the
        region of Decapolis.
007:032 They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment
        in his speech.  They begged him to lay his hand on him.
007:033 He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his
        fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.
007:034 Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!"
        that is, "Be opened!"
007:035 Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his
        tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
007:036 He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more
        he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.
007:037 They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all
        things well.  He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"
008:001 In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they
        had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself,
        and said to them,
008:002 "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed
        with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
008:003 If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint
        on the way, for some of them have come a long way."
008:004 His disciples answered him, "From where could one satisfy
        these people with bread here in a deserted place?"
008:005 He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"  They said, "Seven."
008:006 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground,
        and he took the seven loaves.  Having given thanks,
        he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve,
        and they served the multitude.
008:007 They had a few small fish.  Having blessed them, he said
        to serve these also.
008:008 They ate, and were filled.  They took up seven baskets of broken
        pieces that were left over.
008:009 Those who had eaten were about four thousand.
        Then he sent them away.
008:010 Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples,
        and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
008:011 The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from
        him a sign from heaven, and testing him.
008:012 He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this
        generation{The word translated "generation" here (genea) could also
        be translated "people," "race," or "family."} seek a sign?
        Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given
        to this generation."
008:013 He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to
        the other side.
008:014 They forgot to take bread; and they didn't have more than one
        loaf in the boat with them.
008:015 He charged them, saying, "Take heed:  beware of the yeast
        of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
008:016 They reasoned with one another, saying, "It's because we
        have no bread."
008:017 Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why do you reason that
        it's because you have no bread?  Don't you perceive yet,
        neither understand?  Is your heart still hardened?
008:018 Having eyes, don't you see?  Having ears, don't you hear?
        Don't you remember?
008:019 When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand,
        how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"
        They told him, "Twelve."
008:020 "When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many
        baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"
        They told him, "Seven."
008:021 He asked them, "Don't you understand, yet?"
008:022 He came to Bethsaida.  They brought a blind man to him,
        and begged him to touch him.
008:023 He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him
        out of the village.  When he had spit on his eyes, and laid
        his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
008:024 He looked up, and said, "I see men; for I see them
        like trees walking."
008:025 Then again he laid his hands on his eyes.  He looked intently,
        and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.
008:026 He sent him away to his house, saying, "Don't enter into
        the village, nor tell anyone in the village."
008:027 Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages
        of Caesarea Philippi.  On the way he asked his disciples,
        "Who do men say that I am?"
008:028 They told him, "John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others:
        one of the prophets."
008:029 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
        Peter answered, "You are the Christ."
008:030 He charged them that they should tell no one about him.
008:031 He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things,
        and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes,
        and be killed, and after three days rise again.
008:032 He spoke to them openly.  Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
008:033 But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter,
        and said, "Get behind me, Satan!  For you have in mind not
        the things of God, but the things of men."
008:034 He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said
        to them, "Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself,
        and take up his cross, and follow me.
008:035 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever
        will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News
        will save it.
008:036 For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world,
        and forfeit his life?
008:037 For what will a man give in exchange for his life?
008:038 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this
        adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will
        be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father
        with the holy angels."
009:001 He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there are some
        standing here who will in no way taste death until they see
        the Kingdom of God come with power."
009:002 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John,
        and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves,
        and he was changed into another form in front of them.
009:003 His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow,
        such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
009:004 Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
009:005 Peter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.
        Let's make three tents:  one for you, one for Moses,
        and one for Elijah."
009:006 For he didn't know what to say, for they were very afraid.
009:007 A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud,
        "This is my beloved Son.  Listen to him."
009:008 Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more,
        except Jesus only.
009:009 As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them
        that they should tell no one what things they had seen,
        until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
009:010 They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the "rising
        from the dead" meant.
009:011 They asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah
        must come first?"
009:012 He said to them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things.
        How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer
        many things and be despised?
009:013 But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done
        to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him."
009:014 Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them,
        and scribes questioning them.
009:015 Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed,
        and running to him greeted him.
009:016 He asked the scribes, "What are you asking them?"
009:017 One of the multitude answered, "Teacher, I brought to you my son,
        who has a mute spirit;
009:018 and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams
        at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away.
        I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able."
009:019 He answered him, "Unbelieving generation, how long
        shall I be with you?  How long shall I bear with you?
        Bring him to me."
009:020 They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit
        convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming
        at the mouth.
009:021 He asked his father, "How long has it been since this has come
        to him?"  He said, "From childhood.
009:022 Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water,
        to destroy him.  But if you can do anything, have compassion
        on us, and help us."
009:023 Jesus said to him, "If you can believe, all things are possible
        to him who believes."
009:024 Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, "I believe.
        Help my unbelief!"
009:025 When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked
        the unclean spirit, saying to him, "You mute and deaf spirit,
        I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!"
009:026 Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him.
        The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said,
        "He is dead."
009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
009:028 When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately,
        "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
009:029 He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing,
        except by prayer and fasting."
009:030 They went out from there, and passed through Galilee.
        He didn't want anyone to know it.
009:031 For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them,
        "The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men,
        and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third
        day he will rise again."
009:032 But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid
        to ask him.
009:033 He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them,
        "What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?"
009:034 But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another
        on the way about who was the greatest.
009:035 He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them,
        "If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all,
        and servant of all."
009:036 He took a little child, and set him in the midst of them.
        Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
009:037 "Whoever receives one such little child in my name,
        receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me,
        but him who sent me."
009:038 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow
        us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him,
        because he doesn't follow us."
009:039 But Jesus said, "Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will
        do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak
        evil of me.
009:040 For whoever is not against us is on our side.
009:041 For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
        because you are Christ's, most certainly I tell you,
        he will in no way lose his reward.
009:042 Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me
        to stumble, it would be better for him if he was thrown
        into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
009:043 If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off.
        It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than
        having your two hands to go into Gehenna,{or, Hell} into
        the unquenchable fire,
009:044 'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'
009:045 If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off.
        It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having
        your two feet to be cast into Gehenna,{or, Hell} into the fire
        that will never be quenched--
009:046 'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'
009:047 If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out.
        It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God
        with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into
        the Gehenna{or, Hell} of fire,
009:048 'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is
        not quenched.'{Isaiah 66:24}
009:049 For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
        will be seasoned with salt.
009:050 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness,
        with what will you season it?  Have salt in yourselves,
        and be at peace with one another."
010:001 He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and
        beyond the Jordan.  Multitudes came together to him again.
        As he usually did, he was again teaching them.
010:002 Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, "Is it lawful
        for a man to divorce his wife?"
010:003 He answered, "What did Moses command you?"
010:004 They said, "Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written,
        and to divorce her."
010:005 But Jesus said to them, "For your hardness of heart, he wrote
        you this commandment.
010:006 But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male
        and female.{Genesis 1:27}
010:007 For this cause a man will leave his father and mother,
        and will join to his wife,
010:008 and the two will become one flesh,{Genesis 2:24} so that they
        are no longer two, but one flesh.
010:009 What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
010:010 In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.
010:011 He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another,
        commits adultery against her.
010:012 If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another,
        she commits adultery."
010:013 They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them,
        but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.
010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation,
        and said to them, "Allow the little children to come to me!
        Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to
        such as these.
010:015 Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom
        of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."
010:016 He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his
        hands on them.
010:017 As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him,
        and asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may
        inherit eternal life?"
010:018 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good?  No one is good
        except one--God.
010:019 You know the commandments:  'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,'
        'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,'
        'Honor your father and mother.'"{Exodus 20:12-16;
        Deuteronomy 5:16-20}
010:020 He said to him, "Teacher, I have observed all these things
        from my youth."
010:021 Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, "One thing
        you lack.  Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor,
        and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me,
        taking up the cross."
010:022 But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful,
        for he was one who had great possessions.
010:023 Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, "How difficult it
        is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!"
010:024 The disciples were amazed at his words.  But Jesus answered again,
        "Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches
        to enter into the Kingdom of God!
010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than
        for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
010:026 They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, "Then who
        can be saved?"
010:027 Jesus, looking at them, said, "With men it is impossible,
        but not with God, for all things are possible with God."
010:028 Peter began to tell him, "Behold, we have left all,
        and have followed you."
010:029 Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has
        left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother,
        or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake
        of the Good News,
010:030 but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time,
        houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land,
        with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.
010:031 But many who are first will be last; and the last first."
010:032 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going
        in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed
        were afraid.  He again took the twelve, and began to tell
        them the things that were going to happen to him.
010:033 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.  The Son of Man
        will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes.
        They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him
        to the Gentiles.
010:034 They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him.
        On the third day he will rise again."
010:035 James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him,
        saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask."
010:036 He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
010:037 They said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one at your
        right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory."
010:038 But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking.
        Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized
        with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
010:039 They said to him, "We are able."  Jesus said to them,
        "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall
        be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;
010:040 but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine
        to give, but for whom it has been prepared."
010:041 When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards
        James and John.
010:042 Jesus summoned them, and said to them, "You know that they
        who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them,
        and their great ones exercise authority over them.
010:043 But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become
        great among you shall be your servant.
010:044 Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be
        bondservant of all.
010:045 For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve,
        and to give his life as a ransom for many."
010:046 They came to Jericho.  As he went out from Jericho, with his
        disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus,
        a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
010:047 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out,
        and say, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
010:048 Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out
        much more, "You son of David, have mercy on me!"
010:049 Jesus stood still, and said, "Call him."  They called
        the blind man, saying to him, "Cheer up!  Get up.
        He is calling you!"
010:050 He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
010:051 Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?"
        The blind man said to him, "Rhabboni,{Rhabboni is a transliteration
        of the Hebrew word for "great teacher."} that I may see again."
010:052 Jesus said to him, "Go your way.  Your faith has made you well."
        Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus
        in the way.
011:001 When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage{TR & NU
        read "Bethphage" instead of "Bethsphage"} and Bethany,
        at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
011:002 and said to them, "Go your way into the village that
        is opposite you.  Immediately as you enter into it,
        you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat.
        Untie him, and bring him.
011:003 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord
        needs him;' and immediately he will send him back here."
011:004 They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door
        outside in the open street, and they untied him.
011:005 Some of those who stood there asked them, "What are you doing,
        untying the young donkey?"
011:006 They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
011:007 They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments
        on it, and Jesus sat on it.
011:008 Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting
        down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road.
011:009 Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out,
        "Hosanna{"Hosanna" means "save us" or "help us, we pray."}!
        Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!{Psalm 118:25-26}
011:010 Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming
        in the name of the Lord!  Hosanna in the highest!"
011:011 Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem.  When he had
        looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went
        out to Bethany with the twelve.
011:012 The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.
011:013 Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see
        if perhaps he might find anything on it.  When he came to it,
        he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
011:014 Jesus told it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!"
        and his disciples heard it.
011:015 They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple,
        and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought
        in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers,
        and the seats of those who sold the doves.
011:016 He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.
011:017 He taught, saying to them, "Isn't it written, 'My house will be
        called a house of prayer for all the nations?'{Isaiah 56:7}
        But you have made it a den of robbers!"{Jeremiah 7:11}
011:018 The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how
        they might destroy him.  For they feared him, because all
        the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
011:019 When evening came, he went out of the city.
011:020 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered
        away from the roots.
011:021 Peter, remembering, said to him, "Rabbi, look!  The fig tree
        which you cursed has withered away."
011:022 Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
011:023 For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain,
        'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and doesn't doubt
        in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening;
        he shall have whatever he says.
011:024 Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for,
        believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.
011:025 Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything
        against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven,
        may also forgive you your transgressions.
011:026 But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven
        forgive your transgressions."
011:027 They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple,
        the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,
011:028 and they began saying to him, "By what authority do you do
        these things?  Or who gave you this authority to do these things?"
011:029 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question.  Answer me,
        and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
011:030 The baptism of John--was it from heaven, or from men?
        Answer me."
011:031 They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we should say,
        'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
011:032 If we should say, 'From men'"--they feared the people,
        for all held John to really be a prophet.
011:033 They answered Jesus, "We don't know."  Jesus said to them,
        "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
012:001 He began to speak to them in parables.  "A man planted a vineyard,
        put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower,
        rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.
012:002 When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get
        from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
012:003 They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.
012:004 Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him,
        wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
012:005 Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others,
        beating some, and killing some.
012:006 Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him
        last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
012:007 But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir.
        Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
012:008 They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
012:009 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?  He will come
        and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
012:010 Haven't you even read this Scripture:  'The stone which the
        builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner.
012:011 This was from the Lord, it is marvelous in our eyes'?"{Psalm
        118:22-23}
012:012 They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude;
        for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them.
        They left him, and went away.
012:013 They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him,
        that they might trap him with words.
012:014 When they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know
        that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for you
        aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.
        Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give?"  But he,
        knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me?
        Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."
012:016 They brought it.  He said to them, "Whose is this image
        and inscription?"  They said to him, "Caesar's."
012:017 Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that
        are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
        They marveled greatly at him.
012:018 There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection.
        They asked him, saying,
012:019 "Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies,
        and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children,
        that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring
        for his brother.'
012:020 There were seven brothers.  The first took a wife, and dying
        left no offspring.
012:021 The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him.
        The third likewise;
012:022 and the seven took her and left no children.  Last of all
        the woman also died.
012:023 In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them?
        For the seven had her as a wife."
012:024 Jesus answered them, "Isn't this because you are mistaken,
        not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
012:025 For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry,
        nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
012:026 But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you
        read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke
        to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
        and the God of Jacob'{Exodus 3:6}?
012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
        You are therefore badly mistaken."
012:028 One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together.
        Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him,
        "Which commandment is the greatest of all?"
012:029 Jesus answered, "The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God,
        the Lord is one:
012:030 you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your
        strength.'{Deuteronomy 6:4-5} This is the first commandment.
012:031 The second is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor
        as yourself.'{Leviticus 19:18} There is no other commandment
        greater than these."
012:032 The scribe said to him, "Truly, teacher, you have said well
        that he is one, and there is none other but he,
012:033 and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding,
        with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love
        his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole
        burnt offerings and sacrifices."
012:034 When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him,
        "You are not far from the Kingdom of God."  No one dared ask
        him any question after that.
012:035 Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, "How is it
        that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
012:036 For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said
        to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies
        the footstool of your feet."'{Psalm 110:1}
012:037 Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?"
        The common people heard him gladly.
012:038 In his teaching he said to them, "Beware of the scribes,
        who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings
        in the marketplaces,
012:039 and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:
012:040 those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make
        long prayers.  These will receive greater condemnation."
012:041 Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude
        cast money into the treasury.  Many who were rich cast in much.
012:042 A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins,{literally,
        lepta (or widow's mites).  Lepta are very small brass coins worth
        half a quadrans each, which is a quarter of the copper assarion.
        Lepta are worth less than 1% of an agricultural worker's daily
        wages.} which equal a quadrans coin.{A quadrans is a coin
        worth about 1/64 of a denarius.  A denarius is about one day's
        wages for an agricultural laborer.}
012:043 He called his disciples to himself, and said to them,
        "Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than
        all those who are giving into the treasury,
012:044 for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of
        her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."
013:001 As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him,
        "Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!"
013:002 Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings?
        There will not be left here one stone on another, which will
        not be thrown down."
013:003 As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple,
        Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
013:004 "Tell us, when will these things be?  What is the sign that
        these things are all about to be fulfilled?"
013:005 Jesus, answering, began to tell them, "Be careful that no one
        leads you astray.
013:006 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!{or, "I AM!"}'
        and will lead many astray.
013:007 "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled.
        For those must happen, but the end is not yet.
013:008 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
        There will be earthquakes in various places.  There will
        be famines and troubles.  These things are the beginning
        of birth pains.
013:009 But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils.
        You will be beaten in synagogues.  You will stand before rulers
        and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
013:010 The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.
013:011 When they lead you away and deliver you up, don't be
        anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say,
        but say whatever will be given you in that hour.
        For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
013:012 "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child.
        Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be
        put to death.
013:013 You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who
        endures to the end, the same will be saved.
013:014 But when you see the abomination of desolation,{Daniel 9:17;
        11:31; 12:11} spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it
        ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are
        in Judea flee to the mountains,
013:015 and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in,
        to take anything out of his house.
013:016 Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
013:017 But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse
        babies in those days!
013:018 Pray that your flight won't be in the winter.
013:019 For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has
        not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God
        created until now, and never will be.
013:020 Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would
        have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones,
        whom he picked out, he shortened the days.
013:021 Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'
        or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.
013:022 For there will arise false christs and false prophets,
        and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray,
        if possible, even the chosen ones.
013:023 But you watch.  "Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
013:024 But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened,
        the moon will not give its light,
013:025 the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are
        in the heavens will be shaken.{Isaiah 13:10; 34:4}
013:026 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great
        power and glory.
013:027 Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his
        chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth
        to the ends of the sky.
013:028 "Now from the fig tree, learn this parable.  When the branch
        has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know
        that the summer is near;
013:029 even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass,
        know that it is near, at the doors.
013:030 Most certainly I say to you, this generation{The word
        translated "generation" (genea) could also be translated "race,"
        "family," or "people."} will not pass away until all
        these things happen.
013:031 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
013:032 But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels
        in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
013:033 Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don't know when the time is.
013:034 "It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left
        his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each
        one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.
013:035 Watch therefore, for you don't know when the lord of
        the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight,
        or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;
013:036 lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.
013:037 What I tell you, I tell all:  Watch."
014:001 It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and
        the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes
        sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.
014:002 For they said, "Not during the feast, because there might be
        a riot of the people."
014:003 While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
        as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar
        of ointment of pure nard--very costly.  She broke the jar,
        and poured it over his head.
014:004 But there were some who were indignant among themselves,
        saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted?
014:005 For this might have been sold for more than three hundred
        denarii,{300 denarii was about a years wages for an agricultural
        laborer.} and given to the poor."  They grumbled against her.
014:006 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone.  Why do you trouble her?
        She has done a good work for me.
014:007 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to,
        you can do them good; but you will not always have me.
014:008 She has done what she could.  She has anointed my body beforehand
        for the burying.
014:009 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be
        preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman
        has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."
014:010 Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to
        the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.
014:011 They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money.
        He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.
014:012 On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed
        the Passover, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us
        to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?"
014:013 He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city,
        and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water.
        Follow him,
014:014 and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house,
        'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat
        the Passover with my disciples?"'
014:015 He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready.
        Make ready for us there."
014:016 His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things
        as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.
014:017 When it was evening he came with the twelve.
014:018 As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I
        tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me."
014:019 They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one,
        "Surely not I?"  And another said, "Surely not I?"
014:020 He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me
        in the dish.
014:021 For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him,
        but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!
        It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
014:022 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed,
        he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat.
        This is my body."
014:023 He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them.
        They all drank of it.
014:024 He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant,
        which is poured out for many.
014:025 Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit
        of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the
        Kingdom of God."
014:026 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
014:027 Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because
        of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd,
        and the sheep will be scattered.'{Zechariah 13:7}
014:028 However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
014:029 But Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended,
        yet I will not."
014:030 Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you, that you today,
        even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny
        me three times."
014:031 But he spoke all the more, "If I must die with you, I will
        not deny you."  They all said the same thing.
014:032 They came to a place which was named Gethsemane.
        He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."
014:033 He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly
        troubled and distressed.
014:034 He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
        Stay here, and watch."
014:035 He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that,
        if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
014:036 He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you.
        Please remove this cup from me.  However, not what I desire,
        but what you desire."
014:037 He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon,
        are you sleeping?  Couldn't you watch one hour?
014:038 Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.
        The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
014:039 Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
014:040 Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes
        were very heavy, and they didn't know what to answer him.
014:041 He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now,
        and take your rest.  It is enough.  The hour has come.
        Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
014:042 Arise, let us be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
014:043 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of
        the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs,
        from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
014:044 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I
        will kiss, that is he.  Seize him, and lead him away safely."
014:045 When he had come, immediately he came to him,
        and said, "Rabbi!  Rabbi!" and kissed him.
014:046 They laid their hands on him, and seized him.
014:047 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword,
        and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
014:048 Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber,
        with swords and clubs to seize me?
014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't
        arrest me.  But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."
014:050 They all left him, and fled.
014:051 A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown
        around himself, over his naked body.  The young men grabbed him,
014:052 but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
014:053 They led Jesus away to the high priest.  All the chief priests,
        the elders, and the scribes came together with him.
014:054 Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into
        the court of the high priest.  He was sitting with the officers,
        and warming himself in the light of the fire.
014:055 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses
        against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.
014:056 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony
        didn't agree with each other.
014:057 Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
014:058 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is
        made with hands, and in three days I will build another
        made without hands.'"
014:059 Even so, their testimony did not agree.
014:060 The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you
        no answer?  What is it which these testify against you?"
014:061 But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing.  Again the high priest
        asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
014:062 Jesus said, "I am.  You will see the Son of Man sitting
        at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds
        of the sky."
014:063 The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need
        have we of witnesses?
014:064 You have heard the blasphemy!  What do you think?"
        They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
014:065 Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat
        him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!"  The officers
        struck him with the palms of their hands.
014:066 As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of
        the high priest came,
014:067 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said,
        "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"
014:068 But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you
        are saying."  He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
014:069 The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by,
        "This is one of them."
014:070 But he again denied it.  After a little while again those
        who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of them,
        for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."
014:071 But he began to curse, and to swear, "I don't know this man
        of whom you speak!"
014:072 The rooster crowed the second time.  Peter remembered the word,
        how that Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice,
        you will deny me three times."  When he thought about that, he wept.
015:001 Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders
        and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation,
        and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him
        up to Pilate.
015:002 Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  He answered,
        "So you say."
015:003 The chief priests accused him of many things.
015:004 Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer?  See how many
        things they testify against you!"
015:005 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
015:006 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner,
        whom they asked of him.
015:007 There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made
        insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
015:008 The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always
        did for them.
015:009 Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you
        the King of the Jews?"
015:010 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had
        delivered him up.
015:011 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should
        release Barabbas to them instead.
015:012 Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom
        you call the King of the Jews?"
015:013 They cried out again, "Crucify him!"
015:014 Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"
        But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"
015:015 Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas
        to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him,
        to be crucified.
015:016 The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium;
        and they called together the whole cohort.
015:017 They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns,
        they put it on him.
015:018 They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
015:019 They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing
        their knees, did homage to him.
015:020 When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him,
        and put his own garments on him.  They led him out to crucify him.
015:021 They compelled one passing by, coming from the country,
        Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go
        with them, that he might bear his cross.
015:022 They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is,
        being interpreted, "The place of a skull."
015:023 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he
        didn't take it.
015:024 Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them,
        casting lots on them, what each should take.
015:025 It was the third hour,{9:00 A. M.} and they crucified him.
015:026 The superscription of his accusation was written over him,
        "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
015:027 With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand,
        and one on his left.
015:028 The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was
        numbered with transgressors."
015:029 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
        and saying, "Ha!  You who destroy the temple, and build it
        in three days,
015:030 save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
015:031 Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with
        the scribes said, "He saved others.  He can't save himself.
015:032 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from
        the cross, that we may see and believe him.{TR omits "him"}"
        Those who were crucified with him insulted him.
015:033 When the sixth hour{or, noon} had come, there was darkness
        over the whole land until the ninth hour.{3:00 PM}
015:034 At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi,
        lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God,
        my God, why have you forsaken me?"{Psalm 22:1}
015:035 Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold,
        he is calling Elijah."
015:036 One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on
        a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be.
        Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down."
015:037 Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
015:038 The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
015:039 When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried
        out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this
        man was the Son of God!"
015:040 There were also women watching from afar, among whom were
        both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less
        and of Joses, and Salome;
015:041 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him;
        and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
015:042 When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day,
        that is, the day before the Sabbath,
015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself
        was looking for the Kingdom of God, came.  He boldly went
        in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.
015:044 Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning
        the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.
015:045 When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
015:046 He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen
        cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock.
        He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
015:047 Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where
        he was laid.
016:001 When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother
        of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come
        and anoint him.
016:002 Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb
        when the sun had risen.
016:003 They were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone
        from the door of the tomb for us?"
016:004 for it was very big.  Looking up, they saw that the stone
        was rolled back.
016:005 Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on
        the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
016:006 He said to them, "Don't be amazed.  You seek Jesus,
        the Nazarene, who has been crucified.  He has risen.
        He is not here.  Behold, the place where they laid him!
016:007 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you
        into Galilee.  There you will see him, as he said to you.'"
016:008 They went out,{TR adds "quickly"} and fled from the tomb,
        for trembling and astonishment had come on them.
        They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
016:009 Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week,
        he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast
        out seven demons.
016:010 She went and told those who had been with him, as they
        mourned and wept.
016:011 When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen
        by her, they disbelieved.
016:012 After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them,
        as they walked, on their way into the country.
016:013 They went away and told it to the rest.  They didn't
        believe them, either.
016:014 Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat
        at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness
        of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him
        after he had risen.
016:015 He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the Good News
        to the whole creation.
016:016 He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who
        disbelieves will be condemned.
016:017 These signs will accompany those who believe:  in my name they
        will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;
016:018 they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing,
        it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick,
        and they will recover."
016:019 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received
        up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
016:020 They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them,
        and confirming the word by the signs that followed.  Amen.
Book 42 Luke
001:001 Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning
        those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
001:002 even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and
        servants of the word delivered them to us,
001:003 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all
        things accurately from the first, to write to you in order,
        most excellent Theophilus;
001:004 that you might know the certainty concerning the things
        in which you were instructed.
001:005 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain
        priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah.
        He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
001:006 They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly
        in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
001:007 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they
        both were well advanced in years.
001:008 Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office before
        God in the order of his division,
001:009 according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was
        to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
001:010 The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at
        the hour of incense.
001:011 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right
        side of the altar of incense.
001:012 Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
001:013 But the angel said to him, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your
        request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear
        you a son, and you shall call his name John.
001:014 You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice
        at his birth.
001:015 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink
        no wine nor strong drink.  He will be filled with the Holy Spirit,
        even from his mother's womb.
001:016 He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.
001:017 He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah,
        'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,'
        and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready
        a people prepared for the Lord."
001:018 Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this?
        For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."
001:019 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence
        of God.  I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you
        this good news.
001:020 Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day
        that these things will happen, because you didn't believe
        my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
001:021 The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled
        that he delayed in the temple.
001:022 When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they
        perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple.
        He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
001:023 It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled,
        he departed to his house.
001:024 After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid
        herself five months, saying,
001:025 "Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked
        at me, to take away my reproach among men."
001:026 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
        to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
001:027 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph,
        of the house of David.  The virgin's name was Mary.
001:028 Having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, you highly
        favored one!  The Lord is with you.  Blessed are you among women!"
001:029 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying,
        and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
001:030 The angel said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have
        found favor with God.
001:031 Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son,
        and will call his name 'Jesus.'
001:032 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High.
        The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,
001:033 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
        There will be no end to his Kingdom."
001:034 Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?"
001:035 The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you,
        and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
        Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called
        the Son of God.
001:036 Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son
        in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who
        was called barren.
001:037 For everything spoken by God is possible."
001:038 Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me
        according to your word."  The angel departed from her.
001:039 Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste,
        into a city of Judah,
001:040 and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
001:041 It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,
        that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled
        with the Holy Spirit.
001:042 She called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you
        among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
001:043 Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
001:044 For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears,
        the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
001:045 Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment
        of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!"
001:046 Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
001:047 My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
001:048 for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.
        For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
001:049 For he who is mighty has done great things for me.
        Holy is his name.
001:050 His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.
001:051 He has shown strength with his arm.  He has scattered the proud
        in the imagination of their heart.
001:052 He has put down princes from their thrones.  And has
        exalted the lowly.
001:053 He has filled the hungry with good things.  He has sent
        the rich away empty.
001:054 He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he
        might remember mercy,
001:055 As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever."
001:056 Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned
        to her house.
001:057 Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled,
        and she brought forth a son.
001:058 Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified
        his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.
001:059 It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise
        the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,
        after the name of the father.
001:060 His mother answered, "Not so; but he will be called John."
001:061 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is
        called by this name."
001:062 They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
001:063 He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."
        They all marveled.
001:064 His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed,
        and he spoke, blessing God.
001:065 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings
        were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
001:066 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then
        will this child be?"  The hand of the Lord was with him.
001:067 His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit,
        and prophesied, saying,
001:068 "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited
        and worked redemption for his people;
001:069 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house
        of his servant David
001:070 (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been
        from of old),
001:071 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
001:072 to show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,
001:073 the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,
001:074 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand
        of our enemies, should serve him without fear,
001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
001:076 And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,
        for you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,
001:077 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission
        of their sins,
001:078 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dawn
        from on high will visit us,
001:079 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
        to guide our feet into the way of peace."
001:080 The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was
        in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
002:001 Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from
        Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
002:002 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was
        governor of Syria.
002:003 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
002:004 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
        into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
        because he was of the house and family of David;
002:005 to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married
        to him as wife, being pregnant.
002:006 It happened, while they were there, that the day had come
        that she should give birth.
002:007 She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him
        in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough,
        because there was no room for them in the inn.
002:008 There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field,
        and keeping watch by night over their flock.
002:009 Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory
        of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
002:010 The angel said to them, "Don't be afraid, for behold, I bring
        you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
002:011 For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David,
        a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
002:012 This is the sign to you:  you will find a baby wrapped in strips
        of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."
002:013 Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
        army praising God, and saying,
002:014 "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men."
002:015 It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky,
        that the shepherds said one to another, "Let's go
        to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened,
        which the Lord has made known to us."
002:016 They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph,
        and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
002:017 When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was
        spoken to them about this child.
002:018 All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken
        to them by the shepherds.
002:019 But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
002:020 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
        all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it
        was told them.
002:021 When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child,
        his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel
        before he was conceived in the womb.
002:022 When the days of their purification according to the law
        of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem,
        to present him to the Lord
002:023 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male who opens
        the womb shall be called holy to the Lord"),{Exodus 13:2,12}
002:024 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said
        in the law of the Lord, "A pair of turtledoves, or two
        young pigeons."{Leviticus 12:8}
002:025 Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.
        This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation
        of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
002:026 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should
        not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.{"Christ"
        (Greek) and "Messiah" (Hebrew) both mean "Anointed One"}
002:027 He came in the Spirit into the temple.  When the parents
        brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning
        him according to the custom of the law,
002:028 then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
002:029 "Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to
        your word, in peace;
002:030 for my eyes have seen your salvation,
002:031 which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
002:032 a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of
        your people Israel."
002:033 Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were
        spoken concerning him,
002:034 and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, "Behold,
        this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel,
        and for a sign which is spoken against.
002:035 Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts
        of many hearts may be revealed."
002:036 There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
        of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived
        with a husband seven years from her virginity,
002:037 and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years),
        who didn't depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings
        and petitions night and day.
002:038 Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord,
        and spoke of him to all those who were looking for
        redemption in Jerusalem.
002:039 When they had accomplished all things that were according
        to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their
        own city, Nazareth.
002:040 The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit,
        being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
002:041 His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast
        of the Passover.
002:042 When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
        according to the custom of the feast,
002:043 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning,
        the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem.  Joseph and his
        mother didn't know it,
002:044 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey,
        and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
002:045 When they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem,
        looking for him.h of the children of Benjamin,
023:030 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam
        the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
023:035 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers
        to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
023:038 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
023:039 Uriah the Hittite:  thirty-seven in all.
024:001 Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved
        David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
024:002 The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him,
        Go now back and forth through all the tribes of Israel,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people,
        that I may know the sum of the people.
024:003 Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh your God add to the people,
        however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes
        of my lord the king see it:  but why does my lord the king
        delight in this thing?
024:004 Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab,
        and against the captains of the army.  Joab and the captains
        of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number
        the people of Israel.
024:005 They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right
        side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad,
        and to Jazer:
024:006 then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi;
        and they came to Dan Jaan, and round about to Sidon,
024:007 and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities
        of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out
        to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
024:008 So when they had gone back and forth through all the land,
        they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
024:009 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king:
        and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.
024:010 David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people.
        David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I
        have done:  but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity
        of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
024:011 When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came
        to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
024:012 Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things:
        choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven
        years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee
        three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall
        there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you,
        and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
024:014 David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let us fall
        now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great;
        and let me not fall into the hand of man.
024:015 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even
        to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan
        even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
024:016 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem
        to destroy it, Yahweh repented him of the evil, and said
        to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough;
        now stay your hand.  The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing
        floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:017 David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people,
        and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely;
        but these sheep, what have they done?  Please let your hand
        be against me, and against my father's house.
024:018 Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar
        to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:019 David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
024:020 Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him:  and Araunah went out, and bowed himself
        before the king with his face to the ground.
024:021 Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?
        David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar
        to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
024:022 Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
        what seems good to him:  behold, the oxen for the burnt offering,
        and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen
        for the wood:
024:023 all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.  Araunah said
        to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.
024:024 The king said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly
        buy it of you at a price.  Neither will I offer burnt
        offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.
        So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty
        shekels of silver.
024:025 David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings.  So Yahweh was entreated for the land,
        and the plague was stayed from Israel.
Book 11 1 Kings
001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he got no heat.
001:002 Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin:  and let her stand before
        the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom,
        that my lord the king may keep warm.
001:003 So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all
        the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite,
        and brought her to the king.
001:004 The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king,
        and ministered to him; but the king didn't know her intimately.
001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying,
        I will be king:  and he prepared him chariots and horsemen,
        and fifty men to run before him.
001:006 His father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why have you done so? and he was also a very goodly man;
        and he was born after Absalom.
001:007 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
        the priest:  and they following Adonijah helped him.
001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty
        men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
001:009 Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all
        his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah,
        the king's servants:
001:010 but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men,
        and Solomon his brother, he didn't call.
001:011 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
        Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns,
        and David our lord doesn't know it?
001:012 Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you
        may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
001:013 Go and get you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you,
        my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon
        your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
        why then does Adonijah reign?
001:014 Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will
        come in after you, and confirm your words.
001:015 Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber:  and the king
        was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering
        to the king.
001:016 Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king.  The king said,
        What would you?
001:017 She said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God
        to your handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon your son shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
001:018 Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king,
        don't know it:
001:019 and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
        and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest,
        and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called
        Solomon your servant.
001:020 You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you,
        that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him.
001:021 Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall
        be counted offenders.
001:022 Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet came in.
001:023 They told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet.
        When he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.
001:024 Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, Adonijah shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
001:025 For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings
        and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons,
        and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest;
        and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,
        [Long] live king Adonijah.
001:026 But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest,
        and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.
001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown
        to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord
        the king after him?
001:028 Then king David answered, Call to me Bathsheba.
        She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
001:029 The king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed
        my soul out of all adversity,
001:030 most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me,
        and he shall sit on my throne in my place; most certainly
        so will I do this day.
001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance
        to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.
001:032 King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.  They came
        before the king.
001:033 The king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
        and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring
        him down to Gihon:
001:034 and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel; and blow you the trumpet, and say,
        [Long] live king Solomon.
001:035 Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit
        on my throne; for he shall be king in my place; and I have
        appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
001:036 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,
        and said, Amen:  Yahweh, the God of my lord the king,
        say so [too].
001:037 As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be
        he with Solomon, and makonkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city,
        and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died,
        and was buried in the tomb of his father.
017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim.  Absalom passed over the Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.
017:025 Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab.
        Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra
        the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
017:026 Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
017:027 It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
        the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai
        the Gileadite of Rogelim,
017:028 brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat,
        and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans,
        and lentils, and parched [pulse],
017:029 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd,
        for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat:
        for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty,
        in the wilderness.
018:001 David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains
        of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
018:002 David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son
        of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand
        of Ittai the Gittite.  The king said to the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.
018:003 But the people said, You shall not go forth:  for if we flee away,
        they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
        will they care for us:  but you are worth ten thousand of us;
        therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us
        out of the city.
018:004 The king said to them, What seems you best I will do.
        The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out
        by hundreds and by thousands.
018:005 The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
        gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        All the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.
018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel:
        and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
018:007 The people of Israel were struck there before the servants
        of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day
        of twenty thousand men.
018:008 For the battle was there spread over the surface of all
        the country; and the forest devoured more people that day
        than the sword devoured.
018:009 Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.
        Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under
        the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold
        of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth;
        and the mule that was under him went on.
018:010 A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
        Absalom hanging in an oak.
018:011 Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it,
        and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? and I
        would have given you ten [pieces of] silver, and a sash.
018:012 The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        [pieces of] silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth
        my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king
        charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.
018:013 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there
        is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would
        have set yourself against [me].
018:014 Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you.  He took three darts
        in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
        while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
018:015 Ten young men who bore Joab's armor compassed about and
        struck Absalom, and killed him.
018:016 Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
        after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
018:017 They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest,
        and raised over him a very great heap of stones:
        and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.
018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up
        for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale;
        for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory:
        and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called
        Absalom's monument, to this day.
018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.
018:020 Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day,
        but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall
        bear no news, because the king's son is dead.
018:021 Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen.
        The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come
        what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite.
        Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will
        have no reward for the news?
018:023 But come what may, [said he], I will run.  He said to him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
018:024 Now David was sitting between the two gates:  and the watchman
        went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
018:025 The watchman cried, and told the king.  The king said,
        If he be alone, there is news in his mouth.  He came apace,
        and drew near.
018:026 The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called
        to the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone.
        The king said, He also brings news.
018:027 The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is
        like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.  The king said,
        He is a good man, and comes with good news.
018:028 Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well.
        He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth,
        and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up
        the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
018:029 The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?
        Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant,
        even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know
        what it was.
018:030 The king said, Turn aside, and stand here.  He turned aside,
        and stood still.
018:031 Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my
        lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all
        those who rose up against you.
018:032 The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young
        man Absalom?  The Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord
        the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt,
        be as that young man is.
018:033 The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,
        and wept:  and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom,
        my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom,
        my son, my son!
019:001 It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
019:002 The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people;
        for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.
019:003 The people got them by stealth that day into the city,
        as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
019:004 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
        my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!
019:005 Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed
        this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved
        your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters,
        and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
019:006 in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you.
        For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are
        nothing to you:  for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived,
        and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably
        to your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't
        go forth, there will not stay a man with you this night:
        and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has
        happened to you from your youth until now.
019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  They told to all
        the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate:
        and all the people came before the king.  Now Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.
019:009 All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
        of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of
        our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines;
        and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
019:010 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
        Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing
        the king back?
019:011 King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
        Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last
        to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all
        Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house.
019:012 You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh:
        why then are you the last to bring back the king?
019:013 Say you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain
        of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.
019:014 He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of]
        one man; so that they sent to the king, [saying], Return you,
        and all your servants.
019:015 So the king returned, and came to the Jordan.  Judah came to Gilgal,
        to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
019:016 Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim,
        hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
019:017 There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan
        in the presence of the king.
019:018 A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household,
        and to do what he thought good.  Shimei the son of Gera fell
        down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
019:019 He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me,
        neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely
        the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,
        that the king should take it to his heart.
019:020 For your servant does know that I have sinned:  therefore, behold,
        I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go
        down to meet my lord the king.
019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be
        put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?
019:022 David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah,
        that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there
        any man be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know
        that I am this day king over Israel?
019:023 The king said to Shimei, You shall not die.  The king
        swore to him.
019:024 Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king;
        and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard,
        nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until
        the day he came home in peace.
019:025 It happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
        that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?
019:026 He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me:
        for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may
        ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.
019:027 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord
        the king is as an angel of God:  do therefore what is good
        in your eyes.
019:028 For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king;
        yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table.
        What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more
        to the king?
019:029 The king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters?
        I say, You and Ziba divide the land.
019:030 Mephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all,
        because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.
019:031 Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went
        over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old:
        and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay
        at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
019:033 The king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I
        will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.
019:034 Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years
        of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
019:035 I am this day eighty years old:  can I discern between good
        and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
        can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
        women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my
        lord the king?
019:036 Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
019:037 Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die
        in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother.
        But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord
        the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.
019:038 The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me,
        and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you:
        and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
019:039 All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over:
        and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned
        to his own place.
019:040 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him:
        and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half
        the people of Israel.
019:041 Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king,
        Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away,
        and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan,
        and all David's men with him?
019:042 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king
        is a close relative to us:  why then are you angry for this
        matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or has
        he given us any gift?
019:043 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
        We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right]
        in David than you:  why then did you despise us, that our
        advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?
        The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words
        of the men of Israel.
020:001 There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba,
        the son of Bichri, a Benjamite:  and he blew the trumpet,
        and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance
        in the son of Jesse:  every man to his tents, Israel.
020:002 So all the men of Israel went up from following David,
        and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah
        joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
020:003 David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
        women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house,
        and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance,
        but didn't go in to them.  So they were shut up to the day
        of their death, living in widowhood.
020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together
        within three days, and be here present.
020:005 So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
020:006 David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us
        more harm than did Absalom:  take your lord's servants,
        and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities,
        and escape out of our sight.
020:007 There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went
        out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came
        to meet them.  Joab was girded with his apparel of war that
        he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened
        on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
020:009 Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother?
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels
        to the ground, and didn't strike him again; and he died.
        Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:011 There stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who
        favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.
020:012 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway.
        When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa
        out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him,
        when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
        on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:014 He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah,
        and all the Berites:  and they were gathered together,
        and went also after him.
020:015 They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast
        up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart;
        and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall,
        to throw it down.
020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear!
        Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
020:017 He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab?  He answered,
        I am.  Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid.
        He answered, I do hear.
020:018 Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in
        old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel:
        and so they ended [the matter].
020:019 I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
        why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?
020:020 Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should
        swallow up or destroy.
020:021 The matter is not so:  but a man of the hill country
        of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted
        up his hand against the king, even against David;
        deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.
        The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown
        to you over the wall.
020:022 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom.
        They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri,
        and threw it out to Joab.  He blew the trumpet, and they
        were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent.
        Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
020:023 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
020:024 and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor;
        and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
020:025 and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
020:026 and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
021:001 There was a famine in the days of David three years,
        year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh.
        Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house,
        because he put to death the Gibeonites.
021:002 The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites
        were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of
        the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them:
        and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children
        of Israel and Judah);
021:003 and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
        And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless
        the inheritance of Yahweh?
021:004 The Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold
        between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put
        any man to death in Israel.  He said, What you shall say,
        that will I do for you.
021:005 They said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised
        against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the borders of Israel,
021:006 let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang
        them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.
        The king said, I will give them.
021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel
        the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
021:009 He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
        hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell [all]
        seven together.  They were put to death in the days of harvest,
        in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
021:010 Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
        was poured on them from the sky; and she allowed neither
        the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals
        of the field by night.
021:011 It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
        of Saul, had done.
021:012 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
        his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from
        the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them,
        in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;
021:013 and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son:  and they gathered the bones of those
        who were hanged.
021:014 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country
        of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father:
        and they performed all that the king commanded.
        After that God was entreated for the land.
021:015 The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down,
        and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines.
        David grew faint;
021:016 and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight,
        he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.
021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck
        the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David swore
        to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle,
        that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.
021:018 It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the
        Philistines at Gob:  then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph,
        who was of the sons of the giant.
021:019 There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan
        the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath
        the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like
        a weaver's beam.
021:020 There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
        who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes,
        four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
021:021 When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother,
        killed him.
021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell
        by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
022:001 David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day
        that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,
        and out of the hand of Saul:
022:002 and he said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
        even mine;
022:003 God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield,
        and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge.
        My savior, you save me from violence.
022:004 I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
        So shall I be saved from my enemies.
022:005 For the waves of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
        made me afraid.
022:006 The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death caught me.
022:007 In my distress I called on Yahweh.  Yes, I called to my God.
        He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry [came] into his ears.
022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations of heaven
        quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
022:009 Smoke went up out of his nostrils.  Fire out of his mouth devoured.
        Coals were kindled by it.
022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
        was under his feet.
022:011 He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he was seen on the wings
        of the wind.
022:012 He made darkness pavilions around himself:  gathering of waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.
022:013 At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.
022:014 Yahweh thundered from heaven.  The Most High uttered his voice.
022:015 He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
022:016 Then the channels of the sea appeared.  The foundations of
        the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast
        of the breath of his nostrils.
022:017 He sent from on high and he took me.  He drew me out
        of many waters.
022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me,
        for they were too mighty for me.
022:019 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
        was my support.
022:020 He also brought me out into a large place.  He delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.
022:021 Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
        He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
022:022 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.
022:023 For all his ordinances were before me.  As for his statutes,
        I did not depart fr
022:039 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they
        can't arise.  Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
022:040 For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
        You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
022:041 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
        migh Egyptian had
        a spear in his hand; but he wenttes were not numbered among the children of Israel;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
002:034 Thus the children of Israel did.  According to all that Yahweh
        commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards,
        and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to
        their fathers' houses.
003:001 Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses
        in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai.
003:002 These are the names of the sons of Aaron:  Nadab the firstborn,
        and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests
        who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in
        the priest's office.
003:004 Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh, when they offered strange
        fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had
        no children.  Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's
        office in the presence of Aaron their father.
003:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
003:006 "Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron
        the priest, that they may minister to him.
003:007 They shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
        congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service
        of the tabernacle.
003:008 They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting,
        and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service
        of the tabernacle.
003:009 You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons.  They are
        wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel.
003:010 You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep
        their priesthood.  The stranger who comes near shall be
        put to death."
003:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
003:012 "Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children
        of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among
        the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:
003:013 for all the firstborn are mine.  On the day that I struck
        down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy
        to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal.
        They shall be mine.  I am Yahweh."
003:014 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
003:015 "Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses,
        by their families:  every male from a month old and upward
        shall you number."
003:016 Moses numbered them according to the word of Yahweh,
        as he was commanded.
003:017 These were the sons of Levi by their names:  Gershon, and Kohath,
        and Merari.
003:018 These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families:
        Libni and Shimei.
003:019 The sons of Kohath by their families:  Amram, and Izhar, Hebron,
        and Uzziel.
003:020 The sons of Merari by their families:  Mahli and Mushi.
        These are the families of the Levites according to
        their fathers' houses.
003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family
        of the Shimeites:  these are the families of the Gershonites.
003:022 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all
        the males, from a month old and upward, even those who were
        numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.
003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind
        the tabernacle westward.
003:024 The prince of the fathers' house of the Gershonites shall
        be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
003:025 The charge of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall
        be the tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the screen
        for the door of the Tent of Meeting,
003:026 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door
        of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and around the altar,
        and its cords for all of its service.
003:027 Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
        of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites,
        and the family of the Uzzielites:  these are the families
        of the Kohathites.
003:028 According to the number of all the males, from a month
        old and upward, there were eight thousand six hundred,
        keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall encamp on the south
        side of the tabernacle.
003:030 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of the Kohathites
        shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
003:031 Their charge shall be the ark, the table, the lamp stand,
        the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which they minister,
        and the screen, and all its service.
003:032 Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the princes
        of the Levites, with the oversight of those who keep the charge
        of the sanctuary.
003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family
        of the Mushites.  These are the families of Merari.
003:034 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number
        of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
        thousand two hundred.
003:035 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of Merari
        was Zuriel the son of Abihail.  They shall encamp on the north
        side of the tabernacle.
003:036 The appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the
        tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
        all its instruments, all its service,
003:037 the pillars of the court around it, their sockets, their pins,
        and their cords.
003:038 Those who encamp before the tabernacle eastward,
        in front of the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise,
        shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge
        of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel.
        The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
003:039 All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered
        at the commandment of Yahweh, by their families, all the males
        from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
003:040 Yahweh said to Moses, "Number all the firstborn males
        of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
        and take the number of their names.
003:041 You shall take the Levites for me (I am Yahweh)
        instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel;
        and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn
        among the livestock of the children of Israel."
003:042 Moses numbered, as Yahweh commanded him, all the firstborn
        among the children of Israel.
003:043 All the firstborn males according to the number of names,
        from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them,
        were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.
003:044 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
003:045 "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among
        the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites
        instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine.
        I am Yahweh.
003:046 For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the
        firstborn of the children of Israel, who exceed the number
        of the Levites,
003:047 you shall take five shekels apiece for each one;
        after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them
        (the shekel is twenty gerahs):
003:048 and you shall give the money, with which the remainder of them
        is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons."
003:049 Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded
        the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;
003:050 from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money,
        one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, after the shekel
        of the sanctuary:
003:051 and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons,
        according to the word of Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
004:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
004:002 "Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi,
        by their families, by their fathers' houses,
004:003 from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
        all who enter into the service, to do the work in the
        Tent of Meeting.
004:004 This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting,
        the most holy things.
004:005 When the camp moves forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons,
        and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover
        the ark of the Testimony with it,
004:006 and shall put a covering of sealskin on it, and shall spread
        over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles.
004:007 On the table of show bread they shall spread a blue cloth,
        and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the cups
        with which to pour out; and the continual bread shall be on it.
004:008 They shall spread on them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same
        with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.
004:009 They shall take a blue cloth, and cover the lampstand of the light,
        and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes,
        and all its oil vessels, with which they minister to it.
004:010 They shall put it and all its vessels within a covering of sealskin,
        and shall put it on the frame.
004:011 On the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover
        it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.
004:012 They shall take all the vessels of ministry, with which they
        minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth,
        and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put
        them on the frame.
004:013 They shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
        a purple cloth on it.
004:014 They shall put on it all its vessels, with which they minister
        about it, the fire pans, the flesh hooks, the shovels,
        and the basins; all the vessels of the altar; and they shall
        spread on it a covering of sealskin, and put in its poles.
004:015 "When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary,
        and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp moves forward;
        after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to carry it:
        but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die.
        These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
        Tent of Meeting.
004:016 "The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil
        for the light, the sweet incense, the continual meal offering,
        and the anointing oil, the charge of all the tabernacle,
        and of all that is in it, the sanctuary, and its furnishings."
004:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
004:018 "Don't cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
        from among the Levites;
004:019 but thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they
        approach to the most holy things:  Aaron and his sons shall go in,
        and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden;
004:020 but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment,
        lest they die."
004:021 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
004:022 "Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers'
        houses, by their families;
004:023 from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall
        you number them; all who enter in to wait on the service,
        to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.
004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites,
        in serving and in bearing burdens:
004:025 they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the Tent
        of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is
        above on it, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Meeting,
004:026 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door
        of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and
        around the altar, and their cords, and all the instruments
        of their service, and whatever shall be done with them.
        Therein shall they serve.
004:027 At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
        service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden,
        and in all their service; and you shall appoint to them
        in charge all their burden.
004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites
        in the Tent of Meeting:  and their charge shall be under
        the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
004:029 "As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families,
        by their fathers' houses;
004:030 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old
        shall you number them, everyone who enters on the service,
        to do the work of the Tent of Meeting.
004:031 This is the charge of their burden, according to all their
        service in the Tent of Meeting:  the tabernacle's boards,
        its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
004:032 and the pillars of the court around it, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
        and with all their service:  and by name you shall appoint
        the instruments of the charge of their burden.
004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
        according to all their service, in the Tent of Meeting,
        under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
004:034 Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation
        numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families,
        and by their fathers' houses,
004:035 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the
        Tent of Meeting.
004:036 Those who were numbered of them by their families were two
        thousand seven hundred fifty.
004:037 These are those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites,
        all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron
        numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
004:038 Those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, their families,
        and by their fathers' houses,
004:039 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the
        Tent of Meeting,
004:040 even those who were numbered of them, by their families,
        by their fathers' houses, were two thousand six hundred thirty.
004:041 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Gershon, all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses
        and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh.
004:042 Those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari,
        by their families, by their fathers' houses,
004:043 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the
        Tent of Meeting,
004:044 even those who were numbered of them by their families,
        were three thousand two hundred.
004:045 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the
        commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
004:046 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
        Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by their families,
        and by their fathers' houses,
004:047 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
        everyone who entered in to do the work of service, and the work
        of bearing burdens in the Tent of Meeting,
004:048 even those who were numbered of them, were eight thousand
        five hundred eighty.
004:049 According to the commandment of Yahweh they were numbered by Moses,
        everyone according to his service, and according to his burden.
        Thus were they numbered by him, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
005:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:002 "Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp
        every leper, and everyone who has an issue, and whoever
        is unclean by the dead.
005:003 Both male and female shall you put out, outside of the camp
        shall you put them; that they not defile their camp,
        in the midst of which I dwell."
005:004 The children of Israel did so, and put them out outside of the camp;
        as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
005:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:006 "Speak to the children of Israel:  When a man or woman commits
        any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Yahweh,
        and that soul is guilty;
005:007 then he shall confess his sin which he has done, and he shall
        make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it
        the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom
        he has been guilty.
005:008 But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made
        for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh
        shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement,
        by which atonement shall be made for him.
005:009 Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children
        of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.
005:010 Every man's holy things shall be his:  whatever any man gives
        the priest, it shall be his."
005:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
005:012 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them:
        If any man's wife goes astray, and is unfaithful to him,
005:013 and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes
        of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled,
        and there is no witness against her, and she isn't taken
        in the act;
005:014 and the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous
        of his wife, and she is defiled:  or if the spirit
        of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife,
        and she isn't defiled:
005:015 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring
        her offering for her:  the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal.
        He shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it
        is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial,
        bringing iniquity to memory.
005:016 The priest shall bring her near, and set her before Yahweh;
005:017 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;
        and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle
        the priest shall take, and put it into the water.
005:018 The priest shall set the woman before Yahweh, and let the hair
        of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal offering of
        memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy.
        The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness
        that brings a curse.
005:019 The priest shall cause her to swear, and shall tell the woman,
        'If no man has lain with you, and if you haven't gone aside
        to uncleanness, being under your husband, be free from this
        water of bitterness that brings a curse.
005:020 But if you have gone astray, being under your husband,
        and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you
        besides your husband:'
005:021 then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath
        of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, 'Yahweh make
        you a curse and an oath among your people, when Yahweh allows
        your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;
005:022 and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels,
        and make your body swell, and your thigh fall away.'
        The woman shall say, 'Amen, Amen.'
005:023 "The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall
        blot them out into the water of bitterness.
005:024 He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes
        the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter
        into her and become bitter.
005:025 The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the
        woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh,
        and bring it to the altar.
005:026 The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering,
        as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, and afterward
        shall make the woman drink the water.
005:027 When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen,
        if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against
        her husband, that the water that causes the curse will
        enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell,
        and her thigh will fall away:  and the woman will be a curse
        among her people.
005:028 If the woman isn't defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free,
        and shall conceive seed.
005:029 "This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband,
        goes astray, and is defiled;
005:030 or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous
        of his wife; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh,
        and the priest shall execute on her all this law.
005:031 The man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall
        bear her iniquity."
006:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them:  When either
        man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite,
        to separate himself to Yahweh,
006:003 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink.
        He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink,
        neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh
        grapes or dried.
006:004 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is
        made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.
006:005 "All the days of his vow of separation there shall no
        razor come on his head, until the days are fulfilled,
        in which he separates himself to Yahweh.  He shall be holy.
        He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
006:006 "All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall
        not go near a dead body.
006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for
        his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die;
        because his separation to God is on his head.
006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.
006:009 "If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head
        of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day
        of his cleansing.  On the seventh day he shall shave it.
006:010 On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young
        pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.
006:011 The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other
        for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he
        sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy
        that same day.
006:012 He shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation,
        and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering;
        but the former days shall be void, because his separation
        was defiled.
006:013 "This is the law of the Nazirite:  when the days of his
        separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door
        of the Tent of Meeting,
006:014 and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh, one male lamb
        a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
        ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering,
        and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
006:015 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour
        mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil,
        and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.
006:016 The priest shall present them before Yahweh, and shall offer
        his sin offering, and his burnt offering.
006:017 He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
        to Yahweh, with the basket of unleavened bread.  The priest
        shall offer also its meal offering, and its drink offering.
006:018 The Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door
        of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head
        of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under
        the sacrifice of peace offerings.
006:019 The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one
        unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer,
        and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has
        shaved the head of his separation;
006:020 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
        This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that is
        waved and the thigh that is offered.  After that the Nazirite
        may drink wine.
006:021 "This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, and of his offering
        to Yahweh for his separation, besides that which he is able to get.
        According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law
        of his separation."
006:022 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
006:023 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you
        shall bless the children of Israel.'  You shall tell them,
006:024 'Yahweh bless you, and keep you.
006:025 Yahweh make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you.
006:026 Yahweh lift up his face toward you, and give you peace.'
006:027 "So they shall put my name on the children of Israel;
        and I will bless them."
007:001 It happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up
        the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it,
        with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels,
        and had anointed and sanctified them;
007:002 that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers'
        houses, offered.  These were the princes of the tribes.
        These are they who were over those who were numbered:
007:003 and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons,
        and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for
        each one an ox:  and they presented them before the tabernacle.
007:004 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
007:005 "Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service
        of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites,
        to every man according to his service."
007:006 Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
007:007 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon,
        according to their service:
007:008 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari,
        according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar
        the son of Aaron the priest.
007:009 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service
        of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it
        on their shoulders.
007:010 The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar
        in the day that it was anointed, even the princes gave their
        offerings before the altar.
007:011 Yahweh said to Moses, "They shall offer their offering,
        each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar."
007:012 He who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son
        of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah,
007:013 and his offering was:  one silver platter, the weight of which was
        one hundred thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels,

007:089 When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh,
        he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that
        was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim:
        and he spoke to him.
008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:002 "Speak to Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps,
        the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.'"
008:003 Aaron did so.  He lit its lamps to light the area in front
        of the lampstand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
008:004 This was the workmanship of the lampstand, beaten work of gold.
        From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work:
        according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses,
        so he made the lampstand.
008:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:006 "Take the Levites from among the children of Israel,
        and cleanse them.
008:007 Thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them:  sprinkle the water
        of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor,
        and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
008:008 Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering,
        fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall
        take for a sin offering.
008:009 You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting.
        You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.
008:010 You shall present the Levites before Yahweh.  The children
        of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,
008:011 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering,
        on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs
        to do the service of Yahweh.
008:012 The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls,
        and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for
        a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.
008:013 You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
        and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.
008:014 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children
        of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
008:015 "After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of
        the Tent of Meeting:  and you shall cleanse them, and offer
        them as a wave offering.
008:016 For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel;
        instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all
        the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.
008:017 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine,
        both man and animal.  On the day that I struck all the firstborn
        in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.
008:018 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among
        the children of Israel.
008:019 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
        from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
        the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make
        atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague
        among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel
        come near to the sanctuary."
008:020 Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, to the Levites.  According to all that Yahweh
        commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children
        of Israel did to them.
008:021 The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed
        their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering
        before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
008:022 After that, the Levites went in to do their service in
        the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and before his sons:
        as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
        so they did to them.
008:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
008:024 "This is that which belongs to the Levites:  from twenty-five
        years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service
        in the work of the Tent of Meeting;
008:025 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting
        on the work, and shall serve no more,
008:026 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent
        of Meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
        Thus shall you do to the Levites concerning their duties."
009:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first
        month of the second year after they had come out of the land
        of Egypt, saying,
009:002 "Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover
        in its appointed season.
009:003 On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep
        it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes,
        and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it."
009:004 Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should
        keep the Passover.
009:005 They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth
        day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai.
        According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children
        of Israel did.
009:006 There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body
        of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day,
        and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
009:007 Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of the dead
        body of a man.  Why are we kept back, that we may not offer
        the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among
        the children of Israel?"
009:008 Moses answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will
        command concerning you."
009:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
009:010 "Say to the children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your
        generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a
        journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.
009:011 In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they
        shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread
        and bitter herbs.
009:012 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone
        of it.  According to all the statute of the Passover they
        shall keep it.
009:013 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails
        to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
        Because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its
        appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
009:014 If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover
        to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover,
        and according to its ordinance, so shall he do.
        You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him
        who is born in the land.'"
009:015 On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud
        covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony:
        and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were
        the appearance of fire, until morning.
009:016 So it was continually.  The cloud covered it, and the appearance
        of fire by night.
009:017 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after
        that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where
        the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.
009:018 At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled,
        and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped.  As long
        as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.
009:019 When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days,
        then the children of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh,
        and didn't travel.
009:020 Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle;
        then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped,
        and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.
009:021 Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning;
        and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled:
        or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.
009:022 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud
        stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children
        of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it
        was taken up, they traveled.
009:023 At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment
        of Yahweh they traveled.  They kept the charge of Yahweh,
        at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
010:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
010:002 Make you two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shall you make them:
        and you shall use them for the calling of the congregation,
        and for the journeying of the camps.
010:003 When they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather
        themselves to you at the door of the tent of meeting.
010:004 If they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands
        of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
010:005 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side
        shall take their journey.
010:006 When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie
        on the south side shall take their journey:  they shall blow
        an alarm for their journeys.
010:007 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow,
        but you shall not sound an alarm.
010:008 The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they
        shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.
010:009 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who
        oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets;
        and you shall be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you
        shall be saved from your enemies.
010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts,
        and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets
        over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your
        peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial
        before your God:  I am Yahweh your God.
010:011 It happened in the second year, in the second month,
        on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken
        up from over the tent of the testimony.
010:012 The children of Israel set forward according to their journeys
        out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in
        the wilderness of Paran.
010:013 They first took their journey according to the commandment
        of Yahweh by Moses.
010:014 In the first [place] the standard of the camp of the children
        of Judah set forward according to their armies:
        and over his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
010:015 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
        Nethanel the son of Zuar.
010:016 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab
        the son of Helon.
010:017 The tent was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons
        of Merari, who bore the tent, set forward.
010:018 The standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
        their armies:  and over his army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
010:019 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
        Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
010:020 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph
        the son of Deuel.
010:021 The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary:
        and [the others] did set up the tent against their coming.
010:022 The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward
        according to their armies:  and over his army was Elishama
        the son of Ammihud.
010:023 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
        Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
010:024 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
        Abidan the son of Gideoni.
010:025 The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the
        rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their armies:
        and over his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
010:026 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel
        the son of Ochran.
010:027 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira
        the son of Enan.
010:028 Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according
        to their armies; and they set forward.
010:029 Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses'
        father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said,
        I will give it to you:  come you with us, and we will do you good;
        for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.
010:030 He said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land,
        and to my relatives.
010:031 He said, Don't leave us, please; because you know how we
        are to encamp in the wilderness, and you shall be to us
        instead of eyes.
010:032 It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever
        good Yahweh shall do to us, the same will we do to you.
010:033 They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days' journey;
        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them
        three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
010:034 The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward
        from the camp.
010:035 It happened, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
        Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered;
        and let those who hate you flee before you.
010:036 When it rested, he said, Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands
        of the thousands of Israel.
011:001 The people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Yahweh:
        and when Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire
        of Yahweh burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost
        part of the camp.
011:002 The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh,
        and the fire abated.
011:003 The name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire
        of Yahweh burnt among them.
011:004 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly:
        and the children of Israel also wept again, and said,
        Who shall give us flesh to eat?
011:005 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing;
        the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,
        and the garlic:
011:006 but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save
        this manna to look on.
011:007 The manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it
        as the appearance of bdellium.
011:008 The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
        or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it:
        and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
011:009 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
011:010 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families,
        every man at the door of his tent:  and the anger of Yahweh
        was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.
011:011 Moses said to Yahweh, Why have you dealt ill with your servant?
        and why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay
        the burden of all this people on me?
011:012 Have I conceived all this people?  Have I brought them forth,
        that you should tell me, Carry them in your bosom,
        as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you
        swore to their fathers?
011:013 Where should I get meat to give to all this people? for they
        weep to me, saying, Give us meat, that we may eat.
011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is
        too heavy for me.
011:015 If you deal thus with me, please kill me out of hand, if I have
        found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
011:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders
        of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people,
        and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting,
        that they may stand there with you.
011:017 I will come down and talk with you there:  and I will take
        of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them;
        and they shall bear the burden of the people with you,
        that you not bear it yourself alone.
011:018 Say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow,
        and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears
        of Yahweh, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was
        well with us in Egypt:  therefore Yahweh will give you flesh,
        and you shall eat.
011:019 You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days,
        neither ten days, nor twenty days,
011:020 but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
        be loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh
        who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came
        we forth out of Egypt?
011:021 Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
        thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh,
        that they may eat a whole month.
011:022 Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them?
        or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,
        to suffice them?
011:023 Yahweh said to Moses, Has Yahweh's hand grown short? now shall
        you see whether my word shall happen to you or not.
011:024 Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh:
        and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people,
        and set them round about the Tent.
011:025 Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of
        the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders:
        and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them,
        they prophesied, but they did so no more.
011:026 But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad,
        and the name of the other Medad:  and the Spirit rested on them;
        and they were of those who were written, but had not gone
        out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
011:027 There ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad
        do prophesy in the camp.
011:028 Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his
        chosen men, answered, My lord Moses, forbid them.
011:029 Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake?
        I wish that all Yahweh's people were prophets, that Yahweh
        would put his Spirit on them!
011:030 Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
011:031 There went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quails
        from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's
        journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side,
        round about the camp, and about two cubits above the surface
        of the earth.
011:032 The people rose up all that day, and all the night,
        and all the next day, and gathered the quails:
        he who gathered least gathered ten homers:  and they spread
        them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
011:033 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed,
        the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh
        struck the people with a very great plague.
011:034 The name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there
        they buried the people who lusted.
011:035 From Kibrothhattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth;
        and they abode at Hazeroth.
012:001 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite
        woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
012:002 They said, Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses?  Hasn't he
        spoken also with us?  Yahweh heard it.
012:003 Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were
        on the surface of the earth.
012:004 Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron,
        and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tent of meeting.
        They three came out.
012:005 Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of
        the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
012:006 He said, Hear now my words:  if there be a prophet among you,
        I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision, I will
        speak with him in a dream.
012:007 My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:
012:008 with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly,
        and not in dark speeches; and the form of Yahweh shall he see:
        why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant,
        against Moses?
012:009 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.
012:010 The cloud removed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous,
        as [white as] snow:  and Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold,
        she was leprous.
012:011 Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please don't lay sin on us,
        for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.
012:012 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half
        consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
012:013 Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, Heal her, God, I beg you.
012:014 Yahweh said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face,
        shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up
        outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall
        be brought in again.
012:015 Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days:
        and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in again.
012:016 Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped
        in the wilderness of Paran.
013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
013:002 Send you men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan,
        which I give to the children of Israel:  of every tribe of their
        fathers shall you send a man, everyone a prince among them.
013:003 Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to
        the commandment of Yahweh:  all of them men who were heads
        of the children of Israel.
013:004 These were their names:  Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
        son of Zaccur.
013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi
        the son of Susi.
013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
013:016 These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land.
        Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
013:017 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them,
        Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country:
013:018 and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein,
        whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
013:019 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad;
        and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps,
        or in strongholds;
013:020 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean,
        whether there is wood therein, or not.  Be of good courage,
        and bring of the fruit of the land.  Now the time was the time
        of the first-ripe grapes.
013:021 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness
        of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
013:022 They went up by the South, and came to Hebron;
        and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.
        (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
013:023 They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there
        a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on
        a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates,
        and of the figs.
013:024 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster
        which the children of Israel cut down from there.
013:025 They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
013:026 They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation
        of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh;
        and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation,
        and shown them the fruit of the land.
013:027 They told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us;
        and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is
        the fruit of it.
013:028 However the people who dwell in the land are strong,
        and the cities are fortified, [and] very great:
        and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
013:029 Amalek dwells in the land of the South:  and the Hittite,
        and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country;
        and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side
        of the Jordan.
013:030 Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up
        at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
013:031 But the men who went up with him said, We aren't able to go
        up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
013:032 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had
        spied out to the children of Israel, saying, The land,
        through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats
        up the inhabitants of it; and all the people who we saw in it
        are men of great stature.
013:033 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of
        the Nephilim:  and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,
        and so we were in their sight.
014:001 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;
        and the people wept that night.
014:002 All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron:
        and the whole congregation said to them, Would that we
        had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died
        in this wilderness!
014:003 Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword?
        Our wives and our little ones will be a prey:  wouldn't it
        be better for us to return into Egypt?
014:004 They said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
        return into Egypt.
014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
        of the congregation of the children of Israel.
014:006 Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes:
014:007 and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out,
        is an exceeding good land.
014:008 If Yahweh delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
        and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
014:009 Only don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people
        of the land; for they are bread for us:  their defense
        is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us:
        don't fear them.
014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.
        The glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of meeting to all
        the children of Israel.
014:011 Yahweh said to Moses, How long will this people despise me?
        and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs
        which I have worked among them?
014:012 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
        and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.
014:013 Moses said to Yahweh, Then the Egyptians will hear it;
        for you brought up this people in your might from among them;
014:014 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
        They have heard that you Yahweh are in the midst of this people;
        for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands
        over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day,
        and in a pillar of fire by night.
014:015 Now if you shall kill this people as one man, then the nations
        which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,
014:016 Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into
        the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them
        in the wilderness.
014:017 Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you
        have spoken, saying,
014:018 Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
        forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means
        clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers
        on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.
014:019 Pardon, Please, the iniquity of this people according to
        the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you
        have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
014:020 Yahweh said, I have pardoned according to your word:
014:021 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be
        filled with the glory of Yahweh;
014:022 because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs,
        which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted
        me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;
014:023 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers,
        neither shall any of those who despised me see it:
014:024 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
        and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
        into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.
014:025 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley:
        tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
        to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
014:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
014:027 How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur
        against me?  I have heard the murmurings of the children
        of Israel, which they murmur against me.
014:028 Tell them, As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken
        in my ears, so will I do to you:
014:029 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all
        who were numbered of you, according to your whole number,
        from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
014:030 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I
        swore that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
014:031 But your little ones, that you said should be a prey,
        them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which
        you have rejected.
014:032 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
014:033 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years,
        and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies
        be consumed in the wilderness.
014:034 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land,
        even forty days, for every day a year, shall you bear your
        iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my alienation.
014:035 I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this
        evil congregation, who are gathered together against me:
        in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there
        they shall die.
014:036 The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned,
        and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
        by bringing up an evil report against the land,
014:037 even those men who did bring up an evil report of the land,
        died by the plague before Yahweh.
014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.
014:039 Moses told these words to all the children of Israel:
        and the people mourned greatly.
014:040 They rose up early in the morning, and got them up
        to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we are here,
        and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised:
        for we have sinned.
014:041 Moses said, Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh,
        seeing it shall not prosper?
014:042 Don't go up, for Yahweh isn't among you; that you not be struck
        down before your enemies.
014:043 For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you,
        and you shall fall by the sword:  because you are turned back
        from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh will not be with you.
014:044 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain:
        nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and Moses,
        didn't depart out of the camp.
014:045 Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived
        in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down,
        even to Hormah.
015:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
015:002 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you are
        come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
015:003 and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering,
        or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering,
        or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor to Yahweh,
        of the herd, or of the flock;
015:004 then shall he who offers his offering offer to Yahweh a meal
        offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed
        with the fourth part of a hin of oil:
015:005 and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin,
        shall you prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice,
        for each lamb.
015:006 Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth
        parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with the third part
        of a hin of oil:
015:007 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part
        of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
015:008 When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice,
        to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh;
015:009 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth
        parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil:
015:010 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine,
        for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
015:011 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram,
        or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.
015:012 According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you
        do to everyone according to their number.
015:013 All who are native-born shall do these things after this manner,
        in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
015:014 If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may
        be among you throughout your generations, and will offer
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh;
        as you do, so he shall do.
015:015 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you,
        and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner [with you],
        a statute forever throughout your generations:  as you are,
        so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh.
015:016 One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger
        who lives as a foreigner with you.
015:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
015:018 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come
        into the land where I bring you,
015:019 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land,
        you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.
015:020 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a
        wave offering:  as the wave offering of the threshing floor,
        so shall you heave it.
015:021 Of the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a wave
        offering throughout your generations.
015:022 When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments,
        which Yahweh has spoken to Moses,
015:023 even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that
        Yahweh gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;
015:024 then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge
        of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one
        young bull for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor to Yahweh,
        with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it,
        according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.
015:025 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation
        of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven;
        for it was an error, and they have brought their offering,
        an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering
        before Yahweh, for their error:
015:026 and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall
        be forgiven, and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them;
        for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
015:027 If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female
        goat a year old for a sin offering.
015:028 The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs,
        when he sins unwittingly, before Yahweh, to make atonement for him;
        and he shall be forgiven.
015:029 You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly,
        for him who is native-born among the children of Israel,
        and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.
015:030 But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is
        native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes Yahweh;
        and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
015:031 Because he has despised the word of Yahweh, and has broken
        his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off;
        his iniquity shall be on him.
015:032 While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found
        a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
015:033 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses
        and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
015:034 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared
        what should be done to him.
015:035 Yahweh said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death:
        all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside
        of the camp.
015:036 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned
        him to death with stones; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
015:037 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
015:038 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they
        should make them fringes{or, tassels (Hebrew tzitzit)} in
        the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
        and that they put on the fringe{or, tassel} of each border
        a cord of blue:
015:039 and it shall be to you for a fringe{or, tassel}, that you may look
        on it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and do them;
        and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes,
        after which you use to play the prostitute;
015:040 that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy
        to your God.
015:041 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
        to be your God:  I am Yahweh your God.
016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
        with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son
        of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:
016:002 and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children
        of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation,
        called to the assembly, men of renown;
016:003 and they assembled themselves together against Moses and
        against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you,
        seeing all the congregation are holy, everyone of them,
        and Yahweh is among them:  why then lift yourselves up above
        the assembly of Yahweh?
016:004 When Moses heard it, he fell on his face:
016:005 and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the
        morning Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy,
        and will cause him to come near to him:  even him whom he shall
        choose he will cause to come near to him.
016:006 This do:  take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
016:007 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow:
        and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh does choose, he [shall
        be] holy:  you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.
016:008 Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:
016:009 [seems it but] a small thing to you, that the God of Israel
        has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
        you near to himself, to do the service of the tent of Yahweh,
        and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
016:010 and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons
        of Levi with you? and seek you the priesthood also?
016:011 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together
        against Yahweh:  and Aaron, what is he who you murmur against him?
016:012 Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab;
        and they said, We won't come up:
016:013 is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land
        flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,
        but you must needs make yourself also a prince over us?
016:014 Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk
        and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards:
        will you put out the eyes of these men? we won't come up.
016:015 Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, "Don't respect
        their offering:  I have not taken one donkey from them,
        neither have I hurt one of them."
016:016 Moses said to Korah, You and all your company go before Yahweh,
        you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:
016:017 and take every man his censer, and put incense on them,
        and bring you before Yahweh every man his censer, two hundred
        fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.
016:018 They took every man his censer, and put fire in them,
        and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent
        of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
016:019 Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door
        of the tent of meeting:  and the glory of Yahweh appeared
        to all the congregation.
016:020 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
        consume them in a moment.
016:022 They fell on their faces, and said, God, the God of the spirits
        of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry
        with all the congregation?
016:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:024 Speak to the congregation, saying, Get away from around the tent
        of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
016:025 Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders
        of Israel followed him.
016:026 He spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
        from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs,
        lest you be consumed in all their sins.
016:027 So they got them up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
        on every side:  and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood
        at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons,
        and their little ones.
016:028 Moses said, Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do
        all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.
016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they
        be visited after the visitation of all men; then Yahweh
        hasn't sent me.
016:030 But if Yahweh make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth,
        and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them,
        and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand
        that these men have despised Yahweh.
016:031 It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words,
        that the ground split apart that was under them;
016:032 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up,
        and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah,
        and all their goods.
016:033 So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive
        into Sheol:  and the earth closed on them, and they perished
        from among the assembly.
016:034 All Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them;
        for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
016:035 Fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred
        fifty men who offered the incense.
016:036 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:037 Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up
        the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder;
        for they are holy,
016:038 even the censers of these sinners against their own lives;
        and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar:
        for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they are holy;
        and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
016:039 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who
        were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering
        of the altar,
016:040 to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that
        no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn
        incense before Yahweh; that he not be as Korah, and as his company:
        as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.
016:041 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel
        murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have
        killed the people of Yahweh.
016:042 It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses
        and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting:
        and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.
016:043 Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
016:044 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
016:045 Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them
        in a moment.  They fell on their faces.
016:046 Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire therein
        from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it
        quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them:
        for there is wrath gone out from Yahweh; the plague is begun.
016:047 Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly;
        and behold, the plague was begun among the people:
        and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
016:048 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
016:049 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and
        seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.
016:050 Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting:
        and the plague was stayed.
017:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
017:002 Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods,
        one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according
        to their fathers' houses, twelve rods:  write you every man's
        name on his rod.
017:003 You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there
        shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.
017:004 You shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony,
        where I meet with you.
017:005 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose
        shall bud:  and I will make to cease from me the murmurings
        of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
017:006 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes
        gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers'
        houses, even twelve rods:  and the rod of Aaron was
        among their rods.
017:007 Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.
017:008 It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent
        of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house
        of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms,
        and bore ripe almonds.
017:009 Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all
        the children of Israel:  and they looked, and took every
        man his rod.
017:010 Yahweh said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony,
        to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion;
        that you may make an end of their murmurings against me,
        that they not die.
017:011 Thus did Moses:  as Yahweh commanded him, so did he.
017:012 The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish,
        we are undone, we are all undone.
017:013 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tent of Yahweh, dies:
        shall we perish all of us?
018:001 Yahweh said to Aaron, You and your sons and your fathers'
        house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary;
        and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity
        of your priesthood.
018:002 Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,
        bring you near with you, that they may be joined to you,
        and minister to you:  but you and your sons with you shall
        be before the tent of the testimony.
018:003 They shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent:
        only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary
        and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.
018:004 They shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of
        the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent:
        and a stranger shall not come near to you.
018:005 You shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
        the altar; that there be wrath no more on the children of Israel.
018:006 I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among
        the children of Israel:  to you they are a gift, given to Yahweh,
        to do the service of the tent of meeting.
018:007 You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for
        everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you
        shall serve:  I give you the priesthood as a service of gift:
        and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
018:008 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, I, behold, I have given you the charge
        of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children
        of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing,
        and to your sons, as a portion forever.
018:009 This shall be your of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire:
        every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs,
        and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering
        of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy
        for you and for your sons.
018:010 As the most holy things shall you eat of it; every male shall
        eat of it:  it shall be holy to you.
018:011 This is your:  the wave offering of their gift, even all
        the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given
        them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you,
        as a portion forever; everyone who is clean in your house
        shall eat of it.
018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage,
        and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give
        to Yahweh, to you have I given them.
018:013 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they
        bring to Yahweh, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your
        house shall eat of it.
018:014 Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.
018:015 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they
        offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal shall be yours:
        nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem,
        and the firstborn of unclean animals shall you redeem.
018:016 Those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall
        you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money
        of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary
        (the same is twenty gerahs).
018:017 But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep,
        or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy:
        you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall
        burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet
        savor to Yahweh.
018:018 The flesh of them shall be your, as the wave offering breast
        and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.
018:019 All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children
        of Israel offer to Yahweh, have I given you, and your
        sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever:
        it is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to
        your seed with you.
018:020 Yahweh said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land,
        neither shall you have any portion among them:  I am your
        portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
018:021 To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe
        in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service
        which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
018:022 Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the tent
        of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting,
        and they shall bear their iniquity:  it shall be a statute
        forever throughout your generations; and among the children
        of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
018:024 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave
        offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance:
        therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel
        they shall have no inheritance.
018:025 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
018:026 Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them,
        When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I
        have given you from them for your inheritance, then you
        shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe
        of the tithe.
018:027 Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it
        were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness
        of the winepress.
018:028 Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all
        your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel;
        and of it you shall give Yahweh's wave offering to Aaron the priest.
018:029 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering
        of Yahweh, of all the best of it, even the holy part of it
        out of it.
018:030 Therefore you shall tell them, When you heave the best of it
        from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase
        of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress.
018:031 You shall eat it in every place, you and your households:
        for it is your reward in return for your service in the
        tent of meeting.
018:032 You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved
        from it the best of it:  and you shall not profane the holy
        things of the children of Israel, that you not die.
019:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
019:002 This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded,
        saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring
        you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish,
        [and] on which never came yoke.
019:003 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring
        her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her
        before his face:
019:004 and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
        and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of
        meeting seven times.
019:005 One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh,
        and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
019:006 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
        and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe
        his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp,
        and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
019:008 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe
        his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
019:009 A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
        and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place;
        and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children
        of Israel for a water for impurity:  it is a sin offering.
019:010 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes,
        and be unclean until the even:  and it shall be to the children
        of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner
        among them, for a statute forever.
019:011 He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
019:012 the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day,
        and on the seventh day he shall be clean:  but if he doesn't
        purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall
        not be clean.
019:013 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died,
        and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tent of Yahweh;
        and that soul shall be cut off from Israel:  because the water
        for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean;
        his uncleanness is yet on him.
019:014 This is the law when a man dies in a tent:  everyone who comes
        into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be
        unclean seven days.
019:015 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
019:016 Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword,
        or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be
        unclean seven days.
019:017 For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning
        of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto
        in a vessel:
019:018 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
        and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on
        the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone,
        or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:
019:019 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day,
        and on the seventh day:  and on the seventh day he shall purify him;
        and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and shall be clean at even.
019:020 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
        that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly,
        because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh:
        the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him;
        he is unclean.
019:021 It shall be a perpetual statute to them:  and he who sprinkles
        the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who
        touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.
019:022 Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean;
        and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until even.
020:001 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month:
        and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there,
        and was buried there.
020:002 There was no water for the congregation:  and they assembled
        themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
020:003 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we
        had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!
020:004 Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness,
        that we should die there, we and our animals?
020:005 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us
        in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs,
        or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
        water to drink.
020:006 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to
        the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces:
        and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.
020:007 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
020:008 Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron
        your brother, and speak you to the rock before their eyes,
        that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them
        water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation
        and their livestock drink.
020:009 Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him.
020:010 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock,
        and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring
        you forth water out of this rock?
020:011 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice:
        and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank,
        and their livestock.
020:012 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, Because you didn't believe
        in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
        therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land
        which I have given them.
020:013 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel
        strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.
020:014 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says
        your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has
        happened to us:
020:015 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in
        Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us,
        and our fathers:
020:016 and when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent
        an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt:  and behold,
        we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.
020:017 Please let us pass through your land:  we will not pass
        through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of
        the water of the wells:  we will go along the king's highway;
        we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left,
        until we have passed your border.
020:018 Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, lest I come
        out with the sword against you.
020:019 The children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway;
        and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give
        the price of it:  let me only, without [doing] anything [else],
        pass through on my feet.
020:020 He said, You shall not pass through.  Edom came out against him
        with much people, and with a strong hand.
020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
        why Israel turned away from him.
020:022 They traveled from Kadesh:  and the children of Israel,
        even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
020:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border
        of the land of Edom, saying,
020:024 Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter
        into the land which I have given to the children of Israel,
        because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
020:026 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son:
        and Aaron shall be gathered [to his people], and shall die there.
020:027 Moses did as Yahweh commanded:  and they went up into Mount Hor
        in the sight of all the congregation.
020:028 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar
        his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain:
        and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
020:029 When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept
        for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
021:001 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South,
        heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim;
        and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
021:002 Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
        deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
        destroy their cities.
021:003 Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
        the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities:
        and the name of the place was called Hormah.
021:004 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea
        of Reeds}, to compass the land of Edom:  and the soul
        of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
021:005 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you
        brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there
        is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes
        this light bread.
021:006 Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people;
        and much people of Israel died.
021:007 The people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
        because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you;
        pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.
        Moses prayed for the people.
021:008 Yahweh said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on
        a standard:  and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten,
        when he sees it, shall live.
021:009 Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard:
        and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man,
        when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.
021:010 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.
021:011 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim,
        in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.
021:012 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
021:013 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side
        of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of
        the border of the Amorites:  for the Arnon is the border of Moab,
        between Moab and the Amorites.
021:014 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, "Vaheb
        in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,
021:015 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar,
        leans on the border of Moab."
021:016 From there they traveled to Beer:  that is the well of
        which Yahweh said to Moses, Gather the people together,
        and I will give them water.
021:017 Then sang Israel this song:  "Spring up, well; sing to it:
021:018 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of
        the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles."
        From the wilderness [they traveled] to Mattanah;
021:019 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
021:020 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab,
        to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.
021:021 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
021:022 Let me pass through your land:  we will not turn aside into field,
        or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells:
        we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border.
021:023 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border:
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
        against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz;
        and he fought against Israel.
021:024 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his
        land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon;
        for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
021:025 Israel took all these cities:  and Israel lived in all the cities
        of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns of it.
021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken
        all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.
021:027 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon.
        Let the city of Sihon be built and established;
021:028 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon.
        It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places
        of the Arnon.
021:029 Woe to you, Moab!  You are undone, people of Chemosh!  He has
        given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity,
        to Sihon king of the Amorites.
021:030 We have shot at them.  Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.
        We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."
021:031 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
021:032 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns of it,
        and drove out the Amorites who were there.
021:033 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan:  and Og the king
        of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people,
        to battle at Edrei.
021:034 Yahweh said to Moses, Don't fear him:  for I have delivered
        him into your hand, and all his people, and his land;
        and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        who lived at Heshbon.
021:035 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there
        was none left him remaining:  and they possessed his land.
022:001 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains
        of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
022:002 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done
        to the Amorites.
022:003 Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
        and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
022:004 Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick
        up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass
        of the field.  Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab
        at that time.
022:005 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor,
        which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people,
        to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out
        from Egypt:  behold, they cover the surface of the earth,
        and they abide over against me.
022:006 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are
        too mighty for me:  peradventure I shall prevail, that we
        may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land;
        for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom
        you curse is cursed.
022:007 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
        rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam,
        and spoke to him the words of Balak.
022:008 He said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you
        word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me:  and the princes
        of Moab abode with Balaam.
022:009 God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?
022:010 Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
        has sent to me, [saying],
022:011 Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covers
        the surface of the earth:  now, come curse me them;
        peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall
        drive them out.
022:012 God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall
        not curse the people; for they are blessed.
022:013 Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes
        of Balak, Get you into your land; for Yahweh refuses to give
        me leave to go with you.
022:014 The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said,
        Balaam refuses to come with us.
022:015 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
022:016 They came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son
        of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:
022:017 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you
        say to me I will do.  Please come therefore, and curse this
        people for me.
022:018 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me
        his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word
        of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.
022:019 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may
        know what Yahweh will speak to me more.
022:020 God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men are
        come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word
        which I speak to you, that shall you do.
022:021 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey,
        and went with the princes of Moab.
022:022 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh
        placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.
        Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants
        were with him.
022:023 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way,
        with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey
        turned aside out of the way, and went into the field:
        and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.
022:024 Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards,
        a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
022:025 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself
        to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall:
        and he struck her again.
022:026 The angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place,
        where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
022:027 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam:
        and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey
        with his staff.
022:028 Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said
        to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me
        these three times?
022:029 Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, I would
        there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed you.
022:030 The donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you
        have ridden all your life long to this day? was I ever wont
        to do so to you? and he said, No.
022:031 Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
        of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand;
        and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
022:032 The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey
        these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary,
        because your way is perverse before me:
022:033 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times:
        unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even
        slain you, and saved her alive.
022:034 Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned;
        for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me:
        now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.
022:035 The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only
        the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.
        So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
022:036 When Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him
        to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon,
        which is in the utmost part of the border.
022:037 Balak said to Balaam, Didn't I earnestly send to you to call
        you? why didn't you come to me? am I not able indeed to promote
        you to honor?
022:038 Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you:
        have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word
        that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
022:039 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.
022:040 Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam,
        and to the princes who were with him.
022:041 It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought
        him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there
        the utmost part of the people.
023:001 Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
        me here seven bulls and seven rams.
023:002 Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
        on every altar a bull and a ram.
023:003 Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go:
        perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me; and whatever he shows
        me I will tell you.  He went to a bare height.
023:004 God met Balaam:  and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars,
        and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
023:005 Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak,
        and thus you shall speak.
023:006 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his
        burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
023:007 He took up his parable, and said, From Aram has Balak brought me,
        The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:  Come, curse
        me Jacob, Come, defy Israel.
023:008 How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed?  How shall I defy,
        whom Yahweh has not defied?
023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, From the hills I see him:
        behold, it is a people that dwells alone, And shall not be
        reckoned among the nations.
023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth
        part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the righteous,
        Let my last end be like his!
023:011 Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me?
        I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have
        blessed them altogether.
023:012 He answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which
        Yahweh puts in my mouth?
023:013 Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place,
        from whence you may see them; you shall see but the utmost
        part of them, and shall not see them all:  and curse me
        them from there.
023:014 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
        and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram
        on every altar.
023:015 He said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I
        meet [Yahweh] yonder.
023:016 Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,
        Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.
023:017 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering,
        and the princes of Moab with him.  Balak said to him,
        What has Yahweh spoken?
023:018 He took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear!
        Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man,
        that he should repent.  Has he said, and will he not do it?
        Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
023:020 Behold, I have received a command to bless.  He has blessed,
        and I can't reverse it.
023:021 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.  Neither has he seen
        perverseness in Israel.  Yahweh his God is with him.
        The shout of a king is among them.
023:022 God brings them out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength
        of the wild ox.
023:023 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there
        any divination with Israel.  Now it shall be said of Jacob
        and of Israel, What has God done!
023:024 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts
        himself up.  He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,
        and drinks the blood of the slain.
023:025 Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
        them at all.
023:026 But Balaam answered Balak, Didn't I tell you, saying, All that
        Yahweh speaks, that I must do?
023:027 Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place;
        peradventure it will please God that you may curse me
        them from there.
023:028 Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down
        on the desert.
023:029 Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
        me here seven bulls and seven rams.
023:030 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram
        on every altar.
024:001 When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel,
        he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments,
        but he set his face toward the wilderness.
024:002 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according
        to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.
024:003 He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says,
        the man whose eye was closed says;
024:004 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision
        of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:
024:005 How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel!
024:006 As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside,
        as aloes which Yahweh has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.
024:007 Water shall flow from his buckets.  His seed shall be
        in many waters.  His king shall be higher than Agag.
        His kingdom shall be exalted.
024:008 God brings him out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength
        of the wild ox.  He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
        shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows.
024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall
        rouse him up?  Everyone who blesses you is blessed.
        Everyone who curses you is cursed.
024:010 Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck
        his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you
        to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed
        them these three times.
024:011 Therefore now flee you to your place:  I thought to promote
        you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you
        back from honor.
024:012 Balaam said to Balak, Didn't I also tell your messengers
        who you sent to me, saying,
024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
        I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad
        of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that will I speak?
024:014 Now, behold, I go to my people:  come, [and] I will advertise you
        what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.
024:015 He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says,
        the man whose eye was closed says;
024:016 he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the
        Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,
        and having his eyes open:
024:017 I see him, but not now.  I see him, but not near.
        A star will come out of Jacob.  A scepter will rise out
        of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab,
        and break down all the sons of Sheth.
024:018 Edom shall be a possession.  Seir, his enemies, also shall
        be a possession, while Israel does valiantly.
024:019 Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy
        the remnant from the city.
024:020 He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,
        Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall
        come to destruction.
024:021 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
        Your dwelling place is strong.  Your nest is set in the rock.
024:022 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries
        you away captive.
024:023 He took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when
        God does this?
024:024 But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim.
        They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.
        He also shall come to destruction.
024:025 Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak
        also went his way.
025:001 Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play
        the prostitute with the daughters of Moab:
025:002 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods;
        and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.
025:003 Israel joined himself to Baal Peor:  and the anger of Yahweh
        was kindled against Israel.
025:004 Yahweh said to Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people,
        and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce
        anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.
025:005 Moses said to the judges of Israel, Kill you everyone his men
        who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.
025:006 Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his
        brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in
        the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
025:007 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation,
        and took a spear in his hand;
025:008 and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion,
        and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel,
        and the woman through her body.  So the plague was stayed
        from the children of Israel.
025:009 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
025:010 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel,
        in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I
        didn't consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.
025:012 Therefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:
025:013 and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant
        of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God,
        and made atonement for the children of Israel.
025:014 Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was
        slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
        a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.
025:015 The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi,
        the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers'
        house in Midian.
025:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
025:017 Vex the Midianites, and strike them;
025:018 for they vex you with their wiles, with which they have deceived
        you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi,
        the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was
        slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.
026:001 It happened after the plague, that Yahweh spoke to Moses
        and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
        from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers'
        houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel.
026:003 Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains
        of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
026:004 [Take the sum of the people], from twenty years old and upward;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses and the children of Israel,
        that came forth out of the land of Egypt.
026:005 Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben:
        [of] Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu,

        that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of the congregation,
        who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company
        of Korah, when they strove against Yahweh,
026:010 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together
        with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured
        two hundred fifty men, and they became a sign.
026:011 Notwithstanding, the sons of Korah didn't die.

026:048 The sons of Naphtali after their families:  of Jahzeel,
        the family of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the family of the Gunites;
026:049 of Jezer, the family of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the family
        of the Shillemites.
026:050 These are the families of Naphtali according to their families;
        and those who were numbered of them were forty-five
        thousand four hundred.
026:051 These are those who were numbered of the children of Israel,
        six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty.
026:052 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
026:053 To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according
        to the number of names.
026:054 To the more you shall give the more inheritance,
        and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:
        to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall
        his inheritance be given.
026:055 Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot:
        according to the names of the tribes of their fathers
        they shall inherit.
026:056 According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between
        the more and the fewer.
026:057 These are those who were numbered of the Levites after
        their families:  of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites;
        of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family
        of the Merarites.
026:058 These are the families of Levi:  the family of the Libnites,
        the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites,
        the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites.
        Kohath became the father of Amram.
026:059 The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi,
        who was born to Levi in Egypt:  and she bore to Amram Aaron
        and Moses, and Miriam their sister.
026:060 To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
026:061 Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh.
026:062 Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand,
        every male from a month old and upward:  for they were not
        numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no
        inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
026:063 These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
        who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab
        by the Jordan at Jericho.
026:064 But among these there was not a man of them who were numbered
        by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children
        of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
026:065 For Yahweh had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness.
        There was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        and Joshua the son of Nun.
027:001 Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher,
        the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
        of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these
        are the names of his daughters:  Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah,
        and Milcah, and Tirzah.
027:002 They stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
        and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door
        of the tent of meeting, saying,
027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among
        the company of those who gathered themselves together against
        Yahweh in the company of Korah:  but he died in his own sin;
        and he had no sons.
027:004 Why should the name of our father be taken away from among
        his family, because he had no son?  Give to us a possession
        among the brothers of our father.
027:005 Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.
027:006 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right:  you shall surely give
        them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers;
        and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to
        pass to them.
027:008 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a man die,
        and have no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass
        to his daughter.
027:009 If he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance
        to his brothers.
027:010 If he have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance
        to his father's brothers.
027:011 If his father have no brothers, then you shall give his
        inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family,
        and he shall possess it:  and it shall be to the children
        of Israel a statute [and] ordinance, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
027:012 Yahweh said to Moses, Go up into this mountain of Abarim,
        and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.
027:013 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people,
        as Aaron your brother was gathered;
027:014 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin,
        in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters
        before their eyes.  (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh
        in the wilderness of Zin.)
027:015 Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,
027:016 Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man
        over the congregation,
027:017 who may go out before them, and who may come in before them,
        and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in;
        that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which
        have no shepherd.
027:018 Yahweh said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom
        is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;
027:019 and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all
        the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
027:020 You shall put of your honor on him, that all the congregation
        of the children of Israel may obey.
027:021 He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire
        for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh:
        at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall
        come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him,
        even all the congregation.
027:022 Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set
        him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
027:023 and he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as Yahweh
        spoke by Moses.
028:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
028:002 Command the children of Israel, and tell them, My offering,
        my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor to me,
        shall you observe to offer to me in their due season.
028:003 You shall tell them, This is the offering made by fire which you
        shall offer to Yahweh:  male lambs a year old without blemish,
        two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
028:004 The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb
        shall you offer at even;
028:005 and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering,
        mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai
        for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
028:007 The drink offering of it shall be the fourth part of a hin
        for the one lamb:  in the holy place shall you pour out a drink
        offering of strong drink to Yahweh.
028:008 The other lamb shall you offer at even:  as the meal offering
        of the morning, and as the drink offering of it, you shall
        offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.
028:009 On the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish,
        and two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal offering,
        mixed with oil, and the drink offering of it:
028:010 this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual
        burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.
028:011 In the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt
        offering to Yahweh:  two young bulls, and one ram, seven male
        lambs a year old without blemish;
028:012 and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a
        meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth
        parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil,
        for the one ram;
028:013 and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal
        offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor,
        an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
028:014 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull,
        and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part
        of a hin for a lamb:  this is the burnt offering of every
        month throughout the months of the year.
028:015 One male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be
        offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink
        offering of it.
028:016 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month,
        is Yahweh's Passover.
028:017 On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast:
        seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
028:018 In the first day shall be a holy convocation:  you shall
        do no servile work;
028:019 but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering
        to Yahweh:  two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male
        lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;
028:020 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil:
        three tenth parts shall you offer for a bull, and two tenth
        parts for the ram;
028:021 a tenth part shall you offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;
028:022 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
028:023 You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning,
        which is for a continual burnt offering.
028:024 After this manner you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food
        of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh:
        it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering,
        and the drink offering of it.
028:025 On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation:
        you shall do no servile work.
028:026 Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal
        offering to Yahweh in your [feast of] weeks, you shall have
        a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work;
028:027 but you shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh:
        two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;
028:028 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth
        parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,
028:029 a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
028:030 one male goat, to make atonement for you.
028:031 Besides the continual burnt offering, and the meal offering of it,
        you shall offer them (they shall be to you without blemish),
        and their drink offerings.
029:001 In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall
        have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work:
        it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you.
029:002 You shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh:
        one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;
029:003 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth
        parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the ram,
029:004 and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
029:005 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you;
029:006 besides the burnt offering of the new moon, and the meal offering
        of it, and the continual burnt offering and the meal offering
        of it, and their drink offerings, according to their ordinance,
        for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
029:007 On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have
        a holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls:
        you shall do no manner of work;
029:008 but you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh for a sweet savor:
        one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;
        they shall be to you without blemish;
029:009 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth
        parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,
029:010 a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs:
029:011 one male goat for a sin offering; besides the sin offering
        of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meal
        offering of it, and their drink offerings.
029:012 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have
        a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you
        shall keep a feast to Yahweh seven days:
029:013 and you shall offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savor to Yahweh; thirteen young bulls, two rams,
        fourteen male lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish;
029:014 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil,
        three tenth parts for every bull of the thirteen bulls,
        two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,
029:015 and a tenth part for every lamb of the fourteen lambs;
029:016 and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual
        burnt offering, the meal offering of it, and the drink
        offering of it.
029:017 On the second day [you shall offer] twelve young bulls,
        two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish;
029:018 and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls,
        for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number,
        after the ordinance;
029:019 and one male goat for a sin offering; besides the
        continual burnt offering, and the meal offering of it,
        and their drink offerings.
029:020 On the third day eleven bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs
        a year old without blemish;
029:021 and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls,
        for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number,
        after the ordinance;
029:022 and one male goat for a sin offering; besides the continual

029:035 On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly:
        you shall do no servile work;
029:036 but you shall offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savor to Yahweh:  one bull, one ram, seven male
        lambs a year old without blemish;
029:037 their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bull,
        for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number,
        after the ordinance:
029:038 and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual
        burnt offering, and the meal offering of it, and the drink
        offering of it.
029:039 These you shall offer to Yahweh in your set feasts, besides your vows,
        and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings,
        and for your meal offerings, and for your drink offerings,
        and for your peace offerings.
029:040 Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
        Yahweh commanded Moses.
030:001 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        saying, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded.
030:002 When a man vows a vow to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind
        his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall
        do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
030:003 Also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh, and binds herself
        by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,
030:004 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she
        has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her;
        then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she
        has bound her soul shall stand.
030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears,
        none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound
        her soul, shall stand:  and Yahweh will forgive her,
        because her father disallowed her.
030:006 If she be [married] to a husband, while her vows are on her,
        or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has
        bound her soul,
030:007 and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day
        that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
        with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
030:008 But if her husband disallow her in the day that he hears it,
        then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash
        utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul:
        and Yahweh will forgive her.
030:009 But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced,
        [even] everything with which she has bound her soul,
        shall stand against her.
030:010 If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond
        with an oath,
030:011 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her,
        and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand,
        and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
030:012 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he
        heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning
        her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand:
        her husband has made them void; and Yahweh will forgive her.
030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul,
        her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
        to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds,
        which are on her:  he has established them, because he held
        his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
030:015 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has
        heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
030:016 These are the statutes, which Yahweh commanded Moses,
        between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter,
        being in her youth, in her father's house.
031:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites:
        afterward you shall be gathered to your people.
031:003 Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm you men from among you
        for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute
        Yahweh's vengeance on Midian.
031:004 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        shall you send to the war.
031:005 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel,
        a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
031:006 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war,
        them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
        with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm
        in his hand.
031:007 They warred against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses;
        and they killed every male.
031:008 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain:
        Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five
        kings of Midian:  Balaam also the son of Beor they killed
        with the sword.
031:009 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their
        little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks,
        and all their goods, they took for a prey.
031:010 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all
        their encampments, they burnt with fire.
031:011 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man
        and of animal.
031:012 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
        to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation
        of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab,
        which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
031:013 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of
        the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp.
031:014 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains
        of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from
        the service of the war.
031:015 Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?
031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel
        of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor,
        and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.
031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
        every woman who has known man by lying with him.
031:018 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him,
        keep alive for yourselves.
031:019 Encamp you outside of the camp seven days:  whoever has
        killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain,
        purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day,
        you and your captives.
031:020 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin,
        and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood,
        you shall purify yourselves.
031:021 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle,
        This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses:
031:022 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
        and the lead,
031:023 everything that may abide the fire, you shall make to go
        through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it
        shall be purified with the water for impurity:
        and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go
        through the water.
031:024 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall
        be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp.
031:025 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal,
        you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the congregation;
031:027 and divide the prey into two parts:  between the men skilled
        in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
031:028 Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle:
        one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the oxen,
        and of the donkeys, and of the flocks:
031:029 take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest,
        for Yahweh's wave offering.
031:030 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out
        of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the donkeys,
        and of the flocks, [even] of all the livestock, and give them
        to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tent of Yahweh.
031:031 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:032 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took,
        was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
031:033 and seventy-two thousand oxen,
031:034 and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
031:035 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had
        not known man by lying with him.
031:036 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war,
        was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand
        five hundred sheep:
031:037 and Yahweh's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.
031:038 The oxen were thirty-six thousand; of which Yahweh's
        tribute was seventy-two.
031:039 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Yahweh's
        tribute was sixty-one.
031:040 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Yahweh's tribute
        was thirty-two persons.
031:041 Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh's wave offering,
        to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:042 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off
        from the men who warred
031:043 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven
        thousand five hundred sheep,
031:044 and thirty-six thousand oxen,
031:045 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
031:046 and sixteen thousand persons),
031:047 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn
        out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them
        to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tent of Yahweh;
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:048 The officers who were over the thousands of the army,
        the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds,
        came near to Moses;
031:049 and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum
        of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks
        not one man of us.
031:050 We have brought Yahweh's offering, what every man has gotten,
        of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings,
        and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.
031:051 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,
        even all worked jewels.
031:052 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh,
        of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,
        was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
031:053 ([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
031:054 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
        thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting,
        for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.
032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had
        a very great multitude of livestock:  and when they saw
        the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold,
        the place was a place for livestock;
032:002 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke
        to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes
        of the congregation, saying,
032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon,
        and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
032:004 the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel,
        is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.
032:005 They said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land
        be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us
        over the Jordan.
032:006 Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall
        you sit here?
032:007 Why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from
        going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?
032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea
        to see the land.
032:009 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
        they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they
        should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.
032:010 Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,
032:011 Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
        old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
032:012 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua
        the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Yahweh.
032:013 Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
        them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years,
        until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, was consumed.
032:014 Behold, you are risen up in your fathers' place, an increase
        of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of
        Yahweh toward Israel.
032:015 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
        them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people.
032:016 They came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
        here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones:
032:017 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children
        of Israel, until we have brought them to their place:
        and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities
        because of the inhabitants of the land.
032:018 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel
        have inherited every man his inheritance.
032:019 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan,
        and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this
        side of the Jordan eastward.
032:020 Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm
        yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,
032:021 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh,
        until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
032:022 and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you
        shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel;
        and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.
032:023 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh;
        and be sure your sin will find you out.
032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;
        and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
032:025 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses,
        saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.
032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock,
        shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
032:027 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war,
        before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.
032:028 So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest,
        and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel.
032:029 Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children
        of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man
        who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land shall
        be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land
        of Gilead for a possession:
032:030 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall
        have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
032:031 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying,
        As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.
032:032 We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan,
        and the possession of our inheritance [shall remain] with us
        beyond the Jordan.
032:033 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph,
        the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities of it
        with [their] borders, even the cities of the land round about.
032:034 The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
032:035 and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
032:036 and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran:  fortified cities,
        and folds for sheep.
032:037 The children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
032:038 and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah:
        and they gave other names to the cities which they built.
032:039 The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
        and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.
032:040 Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh;
        and he lived therein.
032:041 Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of it,
        and called them Havvoth Jair.
032:042 Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages of it, and called
        it Nobah, after his own name.
033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they
        went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under
        the hand of Moses and Aaron.
033:002 Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
        by the commandment of Yahweh:  and these are their journeys
        according to their goings out.
033:003 They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth
        day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover
        the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight
        of all the Egyptians,
033:004 while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn,
        whom Yahweh had struck among them:  on their gods also
        Yahweh executed judgments.
033:005 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped
        in Succoth.
033:006 They traveled from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is
        in the edge of the wilderness.
033:007 They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth,
        which is before Baal Zephon:  and they encamped before Migdol.
033:008 They traveled from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst
        of the sea into the wilderness:  and they went three days'
        journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.
033:009 They traveled from Marah, and came to Elim:  and in Elim
        were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees;
        and they encamped there.
033:010 They traveled from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea{or, Sea of
        Reeds}.
033:011 They traveled from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, and encamped
        in the wilderness of Sin.
033:012 They traveled from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
033:013 They traveled from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
033:014 They traveled from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where was
        no water for the people to drink.
033:015 They traveled from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.
033:016 They traveled from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped
        in Kibroth Hattaavah.
033:017 They traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.
033:018 They traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.
033:019 They traveled from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon Perez.
033:020 They traveled from Rimmon Perez, and encamped in Libnah.
033:021 They traveled from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah.
033:022 They traveled from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.
033:023 They traveled from Kehelathah, and encamped in Mount Shepher.
033:024 They traveled from Mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.
033:025 They traveled from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.
033:026 They traveled from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.
033:027 They traveled from Tahath, and encamped in Terah.
033:028 They traveled from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah.
033:029 They traveled from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah.
033:030 They traveled from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.
033:031 They traveled from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene Jaakan.
033:032 They traveled from Bene Jaakan, and encamped in Hor Haggidgad.
033:033 They traveled from Hor Haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.
033:034 They traveled from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.
033:035 They traveled from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion Geber.
033:036 They traveled from Ezion Geber, and encamped in the wilderness
        of Zin (the same is Kadesh).
033:037 They traveled from Kadesh, and encamped in Mount Hor,
        in the edge of the land of Edom.
033:038 Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment
        of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth year after
        the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
        in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
033:039 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died
        in Mount Hor.
033:040 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South in the land
        of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
033:041 They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.
033:042 They traveled from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
033:043 They traveled from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.
033:044 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped in Iye Abarim,
        in the border of Moab.
033:045 They traveled from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon Gad.
033:046 They traveled from Dibon Gad, and encamped in Almon Diblathaim.
033:047 They traveled from Almon Diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains
        of Abarim, before Nebo.
033:048 They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped
        in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
033:049 They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to
        Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
033:050 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan
        at Jericho, saying,
033:051 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass
        over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
033:052 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land
        from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones],
        and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all
        their high places:
033:053 and you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein;
        for to you have I given the land to possess it.
033:054 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families;
        to the more you shall give the more inheritance,
        and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:
        wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his;
        according to the tribes of your fathers shall you inherit.
033:055 But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land
        from before you, then shall those who you let remain of them
        be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides,
        and they shall vex you in the land in which you dwell.
033:056 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I
        do to you.
034:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
034:002 Command the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come
        into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall
        to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according
        to the borders of it),
034:003 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
        along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be
        from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;
034:004 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent
        of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out of it
        shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth
        to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon;
034:005 and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt,
        and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
034:006 For the western border, you shall have the great sea and
        the border [of it]: this shall be your west border.
034:007 This shall be your north border:  from the great sea you shall
        mark out for you Mount Hor;
034:008 from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath;
        and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;
034:009 and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it
        shall be at Hazar Enan:  this shall be your north border.
034:010 You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;
034:011 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah,
        on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down,
        and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
034:012 and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings
        out of it shall be at the Salt Sea.  This shall be your land
        according to the borders of it round about.
034:013 Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land
        which you shall inherit by lot, which Yahweh has commanded
        to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;
034:014 for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers'
        houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according
        to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:
034:015 the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance
        beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.
034:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
034:017 These are the names of the men who shall divide the land
        to you for inheritance:  Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
        the son of Nun.
034:018 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide
        the land for inheritance.
034:019 These are the names of the men:  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the
        son of Jephunneh.
034:020 Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
034:022 Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the
        son of Jogli.
034:023 Of the children of Joseph:  of the tribe of the children
        of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
034:024 Of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the
        son of Shiphtan.
034:025 Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the
        son of Parnach.
034:026 Of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince,
        Paltiel the son of Azzan.
034:027 Of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the
        son of Shelomi.
034:028 Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince,
        Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
034:029 These are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance
        to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
035:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan
        at Jericho, saying,
035:002 Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites
        of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in;
        and suburbs for the cities round about them shall you give
        to the Levites.
035:003 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs
        shall be for their livestock, and for their substance,
        and for all their animals.
035:004 The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites,
        shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand
        cubits round about.
035:005 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two
        thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits,
        and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north
        side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst.
        This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
035:006 The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six
        cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to:
        and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.
035:007 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be
        forty-eight cities; them [shall you give] with their suburbs.
035:008 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession
        of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many;
        and from the few you shall take few:  everyone according
        to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities
        to the Levites.
035:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
035:010 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass
        over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
035:011 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge
        for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly
        may flee there.
035:012 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger,
        that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the
        congregation for judgment.
035:013 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six
        cities of refuge.
035:014 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three
        cities shall you give in the land of Canaan; they shall
        be cities of refuge.
035:015 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner
        living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge;
        that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
035:016 But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died,
        he is a murderer:  the murderer shall surely be put to death.
035:017 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die,
        and he died, he is a murderer:  the murderer shall surely
        be put to death.
035:018 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand,
        by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer:
        the murderer shall surely be put to death.
035:019 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death:
        when he meets him, he shall put him to death.
035:020 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait,
        so that he died,
035:021 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died;
        he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer:
        the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death,
        when he meets him.
035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him
        anything without lying in wait,
035:023 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him,
        and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy,
        neither sought his harm;
035:024 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and
        the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;
035:025 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of
        the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall
        restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled:
        and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest,
        who was anointed with the holy oil.
035:026 But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border
        of his city of refuge, where he flees,
035:027 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his
        city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer;
        he shall not be guilty of blood,
035:028 because he should have remained in his city of refuge
        until the death of the high priest:  but after the death
        of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land
        of his possession.
035:029 These things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance to you
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
035:030 Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at
        the mouth of witnesses:  but one witness shall not testify
        against any person that he die.
035:031 Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer
        who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
035:032 You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city
        of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land,
        until the death of the priest.
035:033 So you shall not pollute the land in which you are:
        for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can
        be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein,
        but by the blood of him who shed it.
035:034 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst
        of which I dwell:  for I, Yahweh, dwell in the midst of
        the children of Israel.
036:001 The heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the
        children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
        of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke
        before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the children of Israel:
036:002 and they said, Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land
        for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel:
        and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance
        of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
036:003 If they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes
        of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken
        away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added
        to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong:
        so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
036:004 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will
        their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe
        whereunto they shall belong:  so will their inheritance be
        taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
036:005 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word
        of Yahweh, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.
036:006 This is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning
        the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married
        to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe
        of their father shall they be married.
036:007 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove
        from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave
        everyone to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
036:008 Every daughter, who possesses an inheritance in any tribe
        of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family
        of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may
        possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
036:009 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe;
        for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave everyone
        to his own inheritance.
036:010 Even as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
036:011 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters
        of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.
036:012 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh
        the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe
        of the family of their father.
036:013 These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh
        commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains
        of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Book 05 Deuteronomy
001:001 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond
        the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph,
        between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
001:002 It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir
        to Kadesh Barnea.
001:003 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,
        on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children
        of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him
        in commandment to them;
001:004 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived
        in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
001:005 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
        this law, saying,
001:006 Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived
        long enough in this mountain:
001:007 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of
        the Amorites, and to all [the places] near there, in the Arabah,
        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South,
        and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon,
        as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you:  go in and possess the land
        which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
001:009 I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear
        you myself alone:
001:010 Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this
        day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
001:011 Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times
        as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!
001:012 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden,
        and your strife?
001:013 Take wise men of understanding and well known according
        to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
001:014 You answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken
        is good [for us] to do.
001:015 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known,
        and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains
        of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens,
        and officers, according to your tribes.
001:016 I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes]
        between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man
        and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.
001:017 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small
        and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man;
        for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard
        for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.
001:018 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
001:019 We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and
        terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill
        country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us;
        and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
001:020 I said to you, You are come to the hill country of the Amorites,
        which Yahweh our God gives to us.
001:021 Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you:
        go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
001:022 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, Let us send
        men before us, that they may search the land for us,
        and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up,
        and the cities to which we shall come.
001:023 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you,
        one man for every tribe:
001:024 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came
        to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
001:025 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
        it down to us, and brought us word again, and said,
        It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.
001:026 Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment
        of Yahweh your God:
001:027 and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Yahweh
        hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
001:028 Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart
        to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we;
        the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover
        we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
001:029 Then I said to you, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.
001:030 Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you,
        according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
001:031 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh
        your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way
        that you went, until you came to this place.
001:032 Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,
001:033 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch
        your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you
        should go, and in the cloud by day.
001:034 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry,
        and swore, saying,
001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation
        see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
001:036 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh:  he shall see it; and to him
        will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children,
        because he has wholly followed Yahweh.
001:037 Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also
        shall not go in there:
001:038 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there:
        encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
001:039 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey,
        and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good
        or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it,
        and they shall possess it.
001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness
        by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
001:041 Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh,
        we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God
        commanded us.  You girded on every man his weapons of war,
        and were forward to go up into the hill country.
001:042 Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don't go up, neither fight;
        for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.
001:043 So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled
        against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous,
        and went up into the hill country.
001:044 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you,
        and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir,
        even to Hormah.
001:045 You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen
        to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
001:046 So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days
        that you abode [there].
002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, as Yahweh spoke to me;
        and we compassed Mount Seir many days.
002:002 Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
002:003 You have compassed this mountain long enough:
        turn you northward.
002:004 Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through
        the border of your brothers the children of Esau,
        who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you:
        take good heed to yourselves therefore;
002:005 don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on;
        because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
002:006 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat;
        and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.
002:007 For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand;
        he has known your walking through this great wilderness:
        these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you;
        you have lacked nothing.
002:008 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell
        in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber.
        We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
002:009 Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them
        in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession;
        because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.
002:010 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many,
        and tall, as the Anakim:
002:011 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites
        call them Emim.
002:012 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau
        succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them,
        and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of
        his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)
002:013 Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.  We went over
        the brook Zered.
002:014 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we
        were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years;
        until all the generation of the men of war were consumed
        from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.
002:015 Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them
        from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
002:016 So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
        from among the people,
002:017 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
002:018 You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
002:019 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon,
        don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give
        you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession;
        because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.
002:020 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim:  Rephaim lived
        therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
002:021 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim;
        but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them,
        and lived in their place;
002:022 as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir,
        when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they
        succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:
002:023 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza,
        the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
        and lived in their place.)
002:024 Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon:
        behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite,
        king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend
        with him in battle.
002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear
        of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall
        hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish
        because of you.
002:026 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon
        king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
002:027 Let me pass through your land:  I will go along by the highway,
        I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
002:028 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me
        water for money, that I may drink:  only let me pass through
        on my feet,
002:029 as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
        who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan
        into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.
002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him;
        for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his
        heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand,
        as at this day.
002:031 Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon
        and his land before you:  begin to possess, that you may
        inherit his land.
002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people,
        to battle at Jahaz.
002:033 Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him,
        and his sons, and all his people.
002:034 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
        every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones;
        we left none remaining:
002:035 only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves,
        with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
002:036 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead,
        there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered
        up all before us:
002:037 only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near;
        all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country,
        and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan:  and Og the king
        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people,
        to battle at Edrei.
003:002 Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him; for I have delivered him,
        and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you
        shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        who lived at Heshbon.
003:003 So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king
        of Bashan, and all his people:  and we struck him until none
        was left to him remaining.
003:004 We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we
        didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob,
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
003:005 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars;
        besides the unwalled towns a great many.
003:006 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon,
        utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women
        and the little ones.
003:007 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took
        for a prey to ourselves.
003:008 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings
        of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley
        of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;
003:009 ([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites
        call it Senir;)
003:010 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
        to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
003:011 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of
        the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron;
        isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits
        was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it,
        after the cubit of a man.)
003:012 This land we took in possession at that time:  from Aroer,
        which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country
        of Gilead, and the cities of it, gave I to the Reubenites
        and to the Gadites:
003:013 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og,
        gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob,
        even all Bashan.  (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair,
        to this day.)
003:015 I gave Gilead to Machir.
003:016 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead
        even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley,
        and the border [of it], even to the river Jabbok, which is
        the border of the children of Ammon;
003:017 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it],
        from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,
        under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
003:018 I commanded you at that time, saying, Yahweh your God has given
        you this land to possess it:  you shall pass over armed before
        your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.
003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock,
        (I know that you have much livestock), shall abide in your
        cities which I have given you,
003:020 until Yahweh give rest to your brothers, as to you, and they
        also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond
        the Jordan:  then shall you return every man to his possession,
        which I have given you.
003:021 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen
        all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings:
        so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.
003:022 You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God, he it is who
        fights for you.
003:023 I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,
003:024 Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness,
        and your strong hand:  for what god is there in heaven or
        in earth, that can do according to your works, and according
        to your mighty acts?
003:025 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond
        the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
003:026 But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't
        listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it suffice you;
        speak no more to me of this matter.
003:027 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward,
        and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes:
        for you shall not go over this Jordan.
003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him;
        for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause
        them to inherit the land which you shall see.
003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Beth Peor.
004:001 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I
        teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess
        the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.
004:002 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall
        you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments
        of Yahweh your God which I command you.
004:003 Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor;
        for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has
        destroyed them from the midst of you.
004:004 But you who did cleave to Yahweh your God are alive everyone
        of you this day.
004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh
        my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst
        of the land where you go in to possess it.
004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
        understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all
        these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise
        and understanding people.
004:007 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them,
        as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?
004:008 What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances
        so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
004:009 Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently,
        lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they
        depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make
        them known to your children and your children's children;
004:010 the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb,
        when Yahweh said to me, Assemble me the people, and I
        will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear
        me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they
        may teach their children.
004:011 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
        burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness,
        cloud, and thick darkness.
004:012 Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire:
        you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only [you
        heard] a voice.
004:013 He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you
        to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them
        on two tables of stone.
004:014 Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
        and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you
        go over to possess it.
004:015 Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner
        of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out
        of the midst of the fire.
004:016 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image
        in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
004:017 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness
        of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
004:018 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness
        of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
004:019 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see
        the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky,
        you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them,
        which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under
        the whole sky.
004:020 But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
        furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance,
        as at this day.
004:021 Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes,
        and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I
        should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God
        gives you for an inheritance:
004:022 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan;
        but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
004:023 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh
        your God, which he made with you, and make you an engraved image
        in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.
004:024 For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
004:025 When you shall father children, and children's children, and you
        shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,
        and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall
        do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
        to provoke him to anger;
004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,
        that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto
        you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong
        your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
004:027 Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall
        be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh shall
        lead you away.
004:028 There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone,
        which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
004:029 But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall
        find him, when you search after him with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
004:030 When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you,
        in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God,
        and listen to his voice:
004:031 for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you,
        neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers
        which he swore to them.
004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you,
        since the day that God created man on the earth, and from
        the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has
        been [any such thing] as this great thing is, or has been
        heard like it?
004:033 Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst
        of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
004:034 Or has God tried to go and take him a nation from the midst
        of [another] nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders,
        and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm,
        and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God
        did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
004:035 To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh he is God;
        there is none else besides him.
004:036 Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might
        instruct you:  and on earth he made you to see his great fire;
        and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
004:037 Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their
        seed after them, and brought you out with his presence,
        with his great power, out of Egypt;
004:038 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you,
        to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance,
        as at this day.
004:039 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh
        he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath;
        there is none else.
004:040 You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I
        command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with
        your children after you, and that you may prolong your days
        in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.
004:041 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan
        toward the sunrise;
004:042 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares,
        and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one
        of these cities he might live:
004:043 [namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country,
        for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites;
        and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
004:044 This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
004:045 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came
        forth out of Egypt,
004:046 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor,
        in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon,
        whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came
        forth out of Egypt.
004:047 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king
        of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan toward the sunrise;
004:048 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
004:049 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea
        of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
005:001 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel,
        the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears
        this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.
005:002 Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
005:003 Yahweh didn't make this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
        even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
005:004 Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of
        the midst of the fire,
005:005 (I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you
        the word of Yahweh:  for you were afraid because of the fire,
        and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying,
005:006 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
        out of the house of bondage.
005:007 You shall have no other gods before me.
005:008 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself,
        [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above,
        or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
        under the earth:
005:009 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them;
        for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
        of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on
        the fourth generation of those who hate me;
005:010 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me
        and keep my commandments.
005:011 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain:
        for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.
005:012 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your
        God commanded you.
005:013 Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;
005:014 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God:
        [in it] you shall not do any work, you, nor your son,
        nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant,
        nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock,
        nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male
        servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
005:015 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt,
        and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty
        hand and by an outstretched arm:  therefore Yahweh your God
        commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
005:016 "Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you;
        that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you,
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
005:017 "You shall not murder.
005:018 "Neither shall you commit adultery.
005:019 "Neither shall you steal.
005:020 "Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.
005:021 "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you
        desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant,
        or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything
        that is your neighbor's."
005:022 These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the
        thick darkness, with a great voice:  and he added no more.
        He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
005:023 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst
        of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire,
        that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes,
        and your elders;
005:024 and you said, Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory
        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst
        of the fire:  we have seen this day that God does speak with man,
        and he lives.
005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
        consume us:  if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more,
        then we shall die.
005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice
        of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire,
        as we have, and lived?
005:027 Go you near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say:
        and speak you to us all that Yahweh our God shall speak to you;
        and we will hear it, and do it.
005:028 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me;
        and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words
        of this people, which they have spoken to you:
        they have well said all that they have spoken.
005:029 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me,
        and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
        with them, and with their children forever!
005:030 Go tell them, Return you to your tents.
005:031 But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you
        all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land
        which I give them to possess it.
005:032 You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has
        commanded you:  you shall not turn aside to the right hand
        or to the left.
005:033 You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has
        commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well
        with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land
        which you shall possess.
006:001 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might
        do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
006:002 that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes
        and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son,
        and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your
        days may be prolonged.
006:003 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it
        may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily,
        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you,
        in a land flowing with milk and honey.
006:004 Hear, Israel:  Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:
006:005 and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, and with all your might.
006:006 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;
006:007 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
        talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk
        by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
006:008 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall
        be for symbols between your eyes.
006:009 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
        and on your gates.
006:010 It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
        the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities,
        which you didn't build,
006:011 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill,
        and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and
        olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat
        and be full;
006:012 then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth
        out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
006:013 You shall fear Yahweh your God; and him shall you serve,
        and shall swear by his name.
006:014 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples
        who are round about you;
006:015 for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God;
        lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you,
        and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
006:016 You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.
006:017 You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,
        and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
006:018 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh;
        that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess
        the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
006:019 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
006:020 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean
        the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Yahweh our God has commanded you?
006:021 then you shall tell your son, We were Pharaoh's bondservants
        in Egypt:  and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
006:022 and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt,
        on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
006:023 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in,
        to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
006:024 Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh
        our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive,
        as at this day.
006:025 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this
        commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.
007:001 When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you
        go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you,
        the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite,
        and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        seven nations greater and mightier than you;
007:002 and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you,
        and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them:
        you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;
007:003 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you
        shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take
        to your son.
007:004 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they
        may serve other gods:  so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled
        against you, and he will destroy you quickly.
007:005 But thus shall you deal with them:  you shall break down their altars,
        and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim,
        and burn their engraved images with fire.
007:006 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God:  Yahweh your
        God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,
        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
007:007 Yahweh didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you
        were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest
        of all peoples:
007:008 but because Yahweh loves you, and because he would keep the oath
        which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh brought you out with
        a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage,
        from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
007:009 Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God,
        who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love
        him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
007:010 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them:
        he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him
        to his face.
007:011 You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes,
        and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
007:012 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances,
        and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with
        you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore
        to your fathers:
007:013 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you;
        he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit
        of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil,
        the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock,
        in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.
007:014 You shall be blessed above all peoples:  there shall not be
        male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.
007:015 Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil
        diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you,
        but will lay them on all those who hate you.
007:016 You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God
        shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them:
        neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a
        snare to you.
007:017 If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I;
        how can I dispossess them?
007:018 you shall not be afraid of them:  you shall well remember
        what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
007:019 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs,
        and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm,
        by which Yahweh your God brought you out:  so shall Yahweh
        your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
007:020 Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them,
        until those who are left, and hide themselves,
        perish from before you.
007:021 You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in
        the midst of you, a great and awesome God.
007:022 Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you
        by little and little:  you may not consume them at once,
        lest the animals of the field increase on you.
007:023 But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will
        confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.
007:024 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you
        shall make their name to perish from under the sky:
        there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you
        have destroyed them.
007:025 The engraved images of their gods shall you burn with fire:
        you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them,
        nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein; for it is
        an abomination to Yahweh your God.
007:026 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become
        a devoted thing like it:  you shall utterly detest it,
        and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
008:001 All the commandment which I command you this day shall you
        observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go
        in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.
008:002 You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you
        these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you,
        to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you
        would keep his commandments, or not.
008:003 He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna,
        which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know;
        that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only,
        but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh
        does man live.
008:004 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell,
        these forty years.
008:005 You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son,
        so Yahweh your God chastens you.
008:006 You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk
        in his ways, and to fear him.
008:007 For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land
        of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing
        into valleys and hills;
008:008 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates;
        a land of olive trees and honey;
008:009 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness,
        you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron,
        and out of whose hills you may dig copper.
008:010 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God
        for the good land which he has given you.
008:011 Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping
        his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes,
        which I command you this day:
008:012 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built
        goodly houses, and lived therein;
008:013 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver
        and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
008:014 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God,
        who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of
        the house of bondage;
008:015 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness,
        [in which were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty
        ground where was no water; who brought you forth water out
        of the rock of flint;
008:016 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers
        didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you,
        to do you good at your latter end:
008:017 and [lest] you say in your heart, My power and the might of my
        hand has gotten me this wealth.
008:018 But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives
        you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant
        which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
008:019 It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk
        after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify
        against you this day that you shall surely perish.
008:020 As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you,
        so shall you perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God.
009:001 Hear, Israel:  you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go
        in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself,
        cities great and fortified up to the sky,
009:002 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know,
        and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before
        the sons of Anak?
009:003 Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes
        over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them,
        and he will bring them down before you:  so shall you drive
        them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has
        spoken to you.
009:004 Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God
        has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my
        righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;
        whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive
        them out from before you.
009:005 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart,
        do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness
        of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from
        before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh
        swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
009:006 Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this
        good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are
        a stiff-necked people.
009:007 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God
        to wrath in the wilderness:  from the day that you went forth
        out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place,
        you have been rebellious against Yahweh.
009:008 Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry
        with you to destroy you.
009:009 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone,
        even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you,
        then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights;
        I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
009:010 Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written
        with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according
        to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
009:011 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
        that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
        of the covenant.
009:012 Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence;
        for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt
        have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside
        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them
        a molten image.
009:013 Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people,
        and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
009:014 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
        from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier
        and greater than they.
009:015 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain
        was burning with fire:  and the two tables of the covenant
        were in my two hands.
009:016 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God;
        you had made you a molten calf:  you had turned aside quickly
        out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
009:017 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
        and broke them before your eyes.
009:018 I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days
        and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water;
        because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which
        was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.
009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,
        with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you.
        But Yahweh listened to me that time also.
009:020 Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him:
        and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
009:021 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it
        with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it
        was as fine as dust:  and I cast the dust of it into the brook
        that descended out of the mountain.
009:022 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah,
        you provoked Yahweh to wrath.
009:023 When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess
        the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against
        the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe him,
        nor listen to his voice.
009:024 You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that
        I knew you.
009:025 So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights
        that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.
009:026 I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your
        people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through
        your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt
        with a mighty hand.
009:027 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look
        to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
        nor to their sin,
009:028 lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was
        not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them,
        and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill
        them in the wilderness.
009:029 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought
        out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.
010:001 At that time Yahweh said to me, Hew you two tables of stone
        like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain,
        and make an ark of wood.
010:002 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first
        tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.
010:003 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables
        of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain,
        having the two tables in my hand.
010:004 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
        the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
        and Yahweh gave them to me.
010:005 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables
        in the ark which I had made; and there they are as
        Yahweh commanded me.
010:006 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah.
        There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son
        ministered in the priest's office in his place.
010:007 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
        to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
010:008 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh
        to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
010:009 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers;
        Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God
        spoke to him.)
010:010 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days
        and forty nights:  and Yahweh listened to me that time also;
        Yahweh would not destroy you.
010:011 Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people;
        and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore
        to their fathers to give to them.
010:012 Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you,
        but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways,
        and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your
        heart and with all your soul,
010:013 to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I
        command you this day for your good?
010:014 Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven
        of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
010:015 Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them,
        and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples,
        as at this day.
010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be
        no more stiff-necked.
010:017 For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords,
        the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't
        regard persons, nor takes reward.
010:018 He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow,
        and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.
010:019 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in
        the land of Egypt.
010:020 You shall fear Yahweh your God; him shall you serve;
        and to him shall you cleave, and by his name shall you swear.
010:021 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you
        these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
010:022 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons;
        and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the
        sky for multitude.
011:001 Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his charge,
        and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always.
011:002 Know you this day:  for I don't speak with your children
        who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement
        of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand,
        and his outstretched arm,
011:003 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt
        to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
011:004 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to
        their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea{or, Sea of
        Reeds} to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how
        Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
011:005 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came
        to this place;
011:006 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,
        the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth,
        and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents,
        and every living thing that followed them, in the midst
        of all Israel:
011:007 but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.
011:008 Therefore shall you keep all the commandment which I command
        you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess
        the land, where you go over to possess it;
011:009 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh
        swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
011:010 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land
        of Egypt, from whence you came out, where you sowed your seed,
        and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
011:011 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills
        and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of the sky,
011:012 a land which Yahweh your God cares for:  the eyes of Yahweh
        your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year
        even to the end of the year.
011:013 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments
        which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
011:014 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former
        rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain,
        and your new wine, and your oil.
011:015 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you
        shall eat and be full.
011:016 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you
        turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
011:017 and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut
        up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land
        shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off
        the good land which Yahweh gives you.
011:018 Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in
        your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand,
        and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
011:019 You shall teach them your children, talking of them,
        when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,
        and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
011:020 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
        and on your gates;
011:021 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,
        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them,
        as the days of the heavens above the earth.
011:022 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I
        command you, to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk
        in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
011:023 then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you
        shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
011:024 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall
        be yours:  from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river,
        the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.
011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you:
        Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread
        of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has
        spoken to you.
011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
011:027 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh
        your God, which I command you this day;
011:028 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments
        of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I
        command you this day, to go after other gods, which you
        have not known.
011:029 It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
        the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set
        the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
011:030 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going
        down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell
        in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
011:031 For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land
        which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it,
        and dwell therein.
011:032 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances
        which I set before you this day.
012:001 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe
        to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you to possess it, all the days that you live
        on the earth.
012:002 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that
        you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains,
        and on the hills, and under every green tree:
012:003 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces
        their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire;
        and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods;
        and you shall destroy their name out of that place.
012:004 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.
012:005 But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all
        your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation
        shall you seek, and there you shall come;
012:006 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
        and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand,
        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn
        of your herd and of your flock:
012:007 and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall
        rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households,
        in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.
012:008 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
        every man whatever is right in his own eyes;
012:009 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
        which Yahweh your God gives you.
012:010 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which
        Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest
        from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;
012:011 then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God
        shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there shall
        you bring all that I command you:  your burnt offerings,
        and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of
        your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.
012:012 You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons,
        and your daughters, and your male servants, and your
        female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates,
        because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
012:013 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings
        in every place that you see;
012:014 but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes,
        there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you
        shall do all that I command you.
012:015 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all
        your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to
        the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you:
        the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle,
        and as of the hart.
012:016 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on
        the earth as water.
012:017 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,
        or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your
        herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow,
        nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
012:018 but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place
        which Yahweh your God shall choose, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your
        female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates:
        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you
        put your hand to.
012:019 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long
        as you live in your land.
012:020 When Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border, as he has
        promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh,
        because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh,
        after all the desire of your soul.
012:021 If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put
        his name there, be too far from you, then you shall kill
        of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you,
        as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates,
        after all the desire of your soul.
012:022 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it:
        the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
012:023 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood:  for the blood
        is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
012:024 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
012:025 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with
        your children after you, when you shall do that which is
        right in the eyes of Yahweh.
012:026 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take,
        and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose:
012:027 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
        on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your
        sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God;
        and you shall eat the flesh.
012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it
        may go well with you, and with your children after you forever,
        when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of
        Yahweh your God.
012:029 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you,
        where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them,
        and dwell in their land;
012:030 take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them,
        after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you
        not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations
        serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
012:031 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God:  for every abomination
        to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done to their gods;
        for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire
        to their gods.
012:032 Whatever thing I command you, that shall you observe to do:
        you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
013:001 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer
        of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,
013:002 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke
        to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have
        not known, and let us serve them;
013:003 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to
        that dreamer of dreams:  for Yahweh your God proves you,
        to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
013:004 You shall walk after Yahweh your God, and fear him, and keep
        his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him,
        and cleave to him.
013:005 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death,
        because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God,
        who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out
        of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in.
        So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
013:006 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son,
        or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend,
        who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us
        go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you,
        nor your fathers;
013:007 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you,
        or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even
        to the other end of the earth;
013:008 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall
        your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall
        you conceal him:
013:009 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him
        to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
013:010 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has
        sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought
        you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
013:011 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more
        such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.
013:012 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities,
        which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, saying,
013:013 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you,
        and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us
        go and serve other gods, which you have not known;
013:014 then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is done in the midst of you,
013:015 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge
        of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein
        and the livestock of it, with the edge of the sword.
013:016 You shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst
        of the street of it, and shall burn with fire the city,
        and all the spoil of it every whit, to Yahweh your God:
        and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
013:017 There shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand;
        that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
        and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you,
        as he has sworn to your fathers;
013:018 when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
        to keep all his commandments which I command you this day,
        to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
014:001 You are the children of Yahweh your God:  you shall not
        cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes
        for the dead.
014:002 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh
        has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,
        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
014:003 You shall not eat any abominable thing.
014:004 These are the animals which you may eat:  the ox, the sheep,
        and the goat,
014:005 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat,
        and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois.
014:006 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two,
        [and] chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.
014:007 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of those who have the hoof cloven:  the camel, and the hare,
        and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't part the hoof,
        they are unclean to you.
014:008 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud,
        is unclean to you:  of their flesh you shall not eat,
        and their carcasses you shall not touch.
014:009 These you may eat of all that are in the waters:
        whatever has fins and scales may you eat;
014:010 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat;
        it is unclean to you.
014:011 Of all clean birds you may eat.
014:012 But these are they of which you shall not eat:  the eagle,
        and the vulture, and the osprey,
014:013 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
014:014 and every raven after its kind,
014:015 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk
        after its kind,
014:016 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
014:017 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
014:018 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe,
        and the bat.
014:019 All winged creeping things are unclean to you:  they shall
        not be eaten.
014:020 Of all clean birds you may eat.
014:021 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself:
        you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is
        within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it
        to a foreigner:  for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God.
        You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
014:022 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed,
        that which comes forth from the field year by year.
014:023 You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the place
        which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there,
        the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
        and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you
        may learn to fear Yahweh your God always.
014:024 If the way be too long for you, so that you are not able
        to carry it, because the place is too far from you,
        which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there,
        when Yahweh your God shall bless you;
014:025 then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money
        in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your
        God shall choose:
014:026 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,
        for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,
        or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat
        there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice,
        you and your household.
014:027 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him;
        for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
014:028 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all
        the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay
        it up within your gates:
014:029 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you,
        and the foreigner living among you, and the fatherless,
        and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come,
        and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless
        you in all the work of your hand which you do.
015:001 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.
015:002 This is the manner of the release:  every creditor
        shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor;
        he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother;
        because Yahweh's release has been proclaimed.
015:003 Of a foreigner you may exact it:  but whatever of your is
        with your brother your hand shall release.
015:004 However there shall be no poor with you; (for Yahweh will
        surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you
        for an inheritance to possess it;)
015:005 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
        to observe to do all this commandment which I command
        you this day.
015:006 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you:
        and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow;
        and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not
        rule over you.
015:007 If there be with you a poor man, one of your brothers,
        within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God
        gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand
        from your poor brother;
015:008 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely
        lend him sufficient for his need [in that] which he wants.
015:009 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying,
        The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye
        be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing;
        and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.
015:010 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved
        when you give to him; because that for this thing Yahweh
        your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you
        put your hand to.
015:011 For the poor will never cease out of the land:
        therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open
        your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor,
        in your land.
015:012 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold to you,
        and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall
        let him go free from you.
015:013 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty:
015:014 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock,
        and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress;
        as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
015:015 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land
        of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you:  therefore I
        command you this thing today.
015:016 It shall be, if he tell you, I will not go out from you;
        because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you;
015:017 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear
        to the door, and he shall be your servant forever.
        Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
015:018 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you;
        for to the double of the hire of a hireling has he served
        you six years:  and Yahweh your God will bless you in all
        that you do.
015:019 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and
        of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God:
        you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd,
        nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
015:020 You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place
        which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.
015:021 If it have any blemish, [as if it be] lame or blind, any ill
        blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.
015:022 You shall eat it within your gates:  the unclean and the clean
        [shall eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
015:023 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on
        the ground as water.
016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God;
        for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth
        out of Egypt by night.
016:002 You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock
        and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose,
        to cause his name to dwell there.
016:003 You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you
        eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction;
        for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:
        that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land
        of Egypt all the days of your life.
016:004 There shall be no yeast seen with you in all your borders
        seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice
        the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
016:005 You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates,
        which Yahweh your God gives you;
016:006 but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover
        at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you
        came forth out of Egypt.
016:007 You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God
        shall choose:  and you shall turn in the morning, and go
        to your tents.
016:008 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh
        day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you shall
        do no work [therein].
016:009 Seven weeks shall you number to you:  from the time you begin
        to put the sickle to the standing grain shall you begin
        to number seven weeks.
016:010 You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute
        of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give,
        according as Yahweh your God blesses you:
016:011 and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,
        and the Levite who is within your gates, and the foreigner,
        and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you,
        in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell there.
016:012 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt:
        and you shall observe and do these statutes.
016:013 You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after that you have
        gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress:
016:014 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,
        and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the fatherless,
        and the widow, who are within your gates.
016:015 Seven days shall you keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place
        which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh your God will bless
        you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands,
        and you shall be altogether joyful.
016:016 Three times in a year shall all your males appear before
        Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose:
        in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,
        and in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear
        before Yahweh empty:
016:017 every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
        of Yahweh your God which he has given you.
016:018 Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates,
        which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes;
        and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
016:019 You shall not wrest justice:  you shall not respect persons;
        neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes
        of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
016:020 That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live,
        and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
016:021 You shall not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside
        the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make you.
016:022 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar; which Yahweh
        your God hates.
017:001 You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep,
        in which is a blemish, [or] anything evil; for that is an
        abomination to Yahweh your God.
017:002 If there be found in the midst of you, within any of your
        gates which Yahweh your God gives you, man or woman,
        who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
        in transgressing his covenant,
017:003 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them,
        or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the sky,
        which I have not commanded;
017:004 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then shall you
        inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is done in Israel,
017:005 then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, who has done
        this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman;
        and you shall stone them to death with stones.
017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is
        to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall
        not be put to death.
017:007 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put
        him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
        So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment,
        between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke
        and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates;
        then shall you arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh
        your God shall choose;
017:009 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge
        who shall be in those days:  and you shall inquire;
        and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.
017:010 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they
        shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose;
        and you shall observe to do according to all that they
        shall teach you:
017:011 according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you,
        and according to the judgment which they shall tell you,
        you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence
        which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
017:012 The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest
        who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God,
        or to the judge, even that man shall die:  and you shall put
        away the evil from Israel.
017:013 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
017:014 When you are come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
        and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say,
        I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are
        round about me;
017:015 you shall surely set him king over you, whom Yahweh your
        God shall choose:  one from among your brothers shall you
        set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you,
        who is not your brother.
017:016 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people
        to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses;
        because Yahweh has said to you, You shall henceforth return
        no more that way.
017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
        not turn away:  neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
        silver and gold.
017:018 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom,
        that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book,
        out of [that which is] before the priests the Levites:
017:019 and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days
        of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God,
        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes,
        to do them;
017:020 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not
        turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left:
        to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom,
        he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
018:001 The priests the Levites, [even] all the tribe of Levi,
        shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel:
        they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,
        and his inheritance.
018:002 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers:
        Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.
018:003 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those
        who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they
        shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
        and the maw.
018:004 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
        and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.
018:005 For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes,
        to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, him and his
        sons for ever.
018:006 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel,
        where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire
        of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
018:007 then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all
        his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.
018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes
        of the sale of his patrimony.
018:009 When you are come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
        you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
018:010 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his
        daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination,
        one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
018:011 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard,
        or a necromancer.
018:012 For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh:
        and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive
        them out from before you.
018:013 You shall be perfect with Yahweh your God.
018:014 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those
        who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you,
        Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.
018:015 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst
        of you, of your brothers, like me; to him you shall listen;
018:016 according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb
        in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again
        the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire
        any more, that I not die.
018:017 Yahweh said to me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
018:018 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers,
        like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall
        speak to them all that I shall command him.
018:019 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words
        which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
018:020 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name,
        which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak
        in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
018:021 If you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which Yahweh
        has not spoken?
018:022 when a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing
        doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh
        has not spoken:  the prophet has spoken it presumptuously,
        you shall not be afraid of him.
019:001 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations, whose land
        Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell
        in their cities, and in their houses;
019:002 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land,
        which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
019:003 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land,
        which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts,
        that every manslayer may flee there.
019:004 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live:
        whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him
        in time past;
019:005 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood,
        and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree,
        and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor,
        so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live:
019:006 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his
        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long,
        and strike him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death,
        inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past.
019:007 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three
        cities for you.
019:008 If Yahweh your God enlarge your border, as he has sworn
        to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised
        to give to your fathers;
019:009 if you shall keep all this commandment to do it, which I command
        you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever
        in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you,
        besides these three:
019:010 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land,
        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance,
        and so blood be on you.
019:011 But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him,
        and rise up against him, and strike him mortally so that he dies,
        and he flee into one of these cities;
019:012 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there,
        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood,
        that he may die.
019:013 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent
        blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
019:014 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old
        time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit,
        in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
        or for any sin, in any sin that he sins:  at the mouth
        of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses,
        shall a matter be established.
019:016 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify
        against him of wrong-doing,
019:017 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
        before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall
        be in those days;
019:018 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition:  and, behold,
        if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely
        against his brother;
019:019 then shall you do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
019:020 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth
        commit no more any such evil in the midst of you.
019:021 Your eyes shall not pity; life [shall go] for life, eye for eye,
        tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
020:001 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses,
        and chariots, [and] a people more than you, you shall
        not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you,
        who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
020:002 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest
        shall approach and speak to the people,
020:003 and shall tell them, Hear, Israel, you draw near this day
        to battle against your enemies:  don't let your heart faint;
        don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
020:004 for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you
        against your enemies, to save you.
020:005 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is
        there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let
        him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle,
        and another man dedicate it.
020:006 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not
        used the fruit of it? let him go and return to his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit of it.
020:007 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife,
        and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
020:008 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say,
        What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? let him
        go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt
        as his heart.
020:009 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking
        to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies
        at the head of the people.
020:010 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim
        peace to it.
020:011 It shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you,
        then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein
        shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
020:012 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you,
        then you shall besiege it:
020:013 and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall
        strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:
020:014 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock,
        and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it,
        shall you take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat
        the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.
020:015 Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off
        from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
020:016 But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you
        for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;
020:017 but you shall utterly destroy them:  the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;
        as Yahweh your God has commanded you;
020:018 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations,
        which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against
        Yahweh your God.
020:019 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war
        against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees of it
        by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them,
        and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man,
        that it should be besieged of you?
020:020 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees
        for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall
        build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you,
        until it fall.
021:001 If one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives
        you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known
        who has struck him;
021:002 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall
        measure to the cities which are round about him who is slain:
021:003 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man,
        even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd,
        which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn
        in the yoke;
021:004 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a
        valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown,
        and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
021:005 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh
        your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name
        of Yahweh; and according to their word shall every controversy
        and every stroke be.
021:006 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man,
        shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken
        in the valley;
021:007 and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,
        neither have our eyes seen it.
021:008 Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed,
        and don't allow innocent blood [to remain] in the midst
        of your people Israel.  The blood shall be forgiven them.
021:009 So shall you put away the innocent blood from the midst of you,
        when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
021:010 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh
        your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry
        them away captive,
021:011 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have
        a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife;
021:012 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall
        shave her head, and pare her nails;
021:013 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her,
        and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her
        mother a full month:  and after that you shall go in to her,
        and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
021:014 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall
        let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at
        all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave,
        because you have humbled her.
021:015 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated,
        and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated;
        and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;
021:016 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons
        to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son
        of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated,
        who is the firstborn:
021:017 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated,
        by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is
        the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey
        the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and,
        though they chasten him, will not listen to them;
021:019 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him,
        and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate
        of his place;
021:020 and they shall tell the elders of his city, This our son
        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;
        he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
021:021 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you;
        and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
021:022 If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put
        to death, and you hang him on a tree;
021:023 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall
        surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed
        of God; that you don't defile your land which Yahweh your God
        gives you for an inheritance.
022:001 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
        and hide yourself from them:  you shall surely bring them
        again to your brother.
022:002 If your brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him,
        then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall
        be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall
        restore it to him.
022:003 So shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with
        his garment; and so shall you do with every lost thing
        of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found:
        you may not hide yourself.
022:004 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox
        fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them:
        you shall surely help him to lift them up again.
022:005 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man
        put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is
        an abomination to Yahweh your God.
022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way,
        in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs,
        and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall
        not take the hen with the young:
022:007 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take
        to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may
        prolong your days.
022:008 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement
        for your roof, that you don't bring blood on your house,
        if any man fall from there.
022:009 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed,
        lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown,
        and the increase of the vineyard.
022:010 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
022:011 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together.
022:012 You shall make yourselves fringes{or, tassles} on the four
        borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
022:013 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,
022:014 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name
        on her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her,
        I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;
022:015 then shall the father of the young lady, and her mother,
        take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady's virginity
        to the elders of the city in the gate;
022:016 and the young lady's father shall tell the elders, I gave
        my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;
022:017 and behold, he has laid shameful things [to her charge], saying,
        I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;
        and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.
        They shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
022:018 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;
022:019 and they shall fine him one hundred [shekels] of silver,
        and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has
        brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel:  and she shall
        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
022:020 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were
        not found in the young lady;
022:021 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door
        of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone
        her to death with stones, because she has done folly
        in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband,
        then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman,
        and the woman:  so shall you put away the evil from Israel.
022:023 If there be a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married
        to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
022:024 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city,
        and you shall stone them to death with stones;
        the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city;
        and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife:
        so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
022:025 But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married
        in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her;
        then the man only who lay with her shall die:
022:026 but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin
        worthy of death:  for as when a man rises against his neighbor,
        and kills him, even so is this matter;
022:027 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married
        lady cried, and there was none to save her.
022:028 If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged
        to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her,
        and they be found;
022:029 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady's father
        fifty [shekels] of silver, and she shall be his wife,
        because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover
        his father's skirt.
023:001 He who is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off,
        shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh;
        even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into
        the assembly of Yahweh.
023:003 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly
        of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging
        to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever:
023:004 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way,
        when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired
        against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia,
        to curse you.
023:005 Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn't listen to Balaam;
        but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you,
        because Yahweh your God loved you.
023:006 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all
        your days forever.
023:007 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother:
        you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner
        in his land.
023:008 The children of the third generation who are born to them
        shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
023:009 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall
        keep you from every evil thing.
023:010 If there be among you any man, who is not clean by reason
        of that which happens him by night, then shall he go abroad
        out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
023:011 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe
        himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come
        within the camp.
023:012 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you
        shall go forth abroad:
023:013 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be,
        when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall
        turn back and cover that which comes from you:
023:014 for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp,
        to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you;
        therefore shall your camp be holy, that he may not see
        an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
023:015 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped
        from his master to you:
023:016 he shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which
        he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best:
        you shall not oppress him.
023:017 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel,
        neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
023:018 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages
        of a dog, into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow:
        for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
023:019 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money,
        interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:
023:020 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother
        you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless
        you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you
        go in to possess it.
023:021 When you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack
        to pay it:  for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you;
        and it would be sin in you.
023:022 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.
023:023 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;
        according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, a freewill offering,
        which you have promised with your mouth.
023:024 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat
        of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not
        put any in your vessel.
023:025 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you
        may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move
        a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
024:001 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it shall be,
        if she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some
        unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce,
        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
024:002 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
        another man's [wife].
024:003 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce,
        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house;
        or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
024:004 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again
        to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination
        before Yahweh:  and you shall not cause the land to sin,
        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
024:005 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army,
        neither shall he be charged with any business:
        he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife
        whom he has taken.
024:006 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge;
        for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.
024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children
        of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him;
        then that thief shall die:  so shall you put away the evil
        from the midst of you.
024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently,
        and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall
        teach you:  as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.
024:009 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you
        came forth out of Egypt.
024:010 When you do lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall
        not go into his house to get his pledge.
024:011 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall
        bring forth the pledge outside to you.
024:012 If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge;
024:013 you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun
        goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you:
        and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
024:014 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy,
        whether he be of your brothers, or of your foreigners who are
        in your land within your gates:
024:015 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun
        go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it:
        lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
024:017 You shall not wrest the justice [due] to the foreigner,
        [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow's clothing to pledge;
024:018 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt,
        and Yahweh your God redeemed you there:  therefore I command
        you to do this thing.
024:019 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot
        a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it:
        it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for
        the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work
        of your hands.
024:020 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the
        boughs again:  it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless,
        and for the widow.
024:021 When you gather [the grapes of] your vineyard, you shall
        not glean it after you:  it shall be for the foreigner,
        for the fatherless, and for the widow.
024:022 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt:
        therefore I command you to do this thing.
025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment,
        and [the judges] judge them; then they shall justify the righteous,
        and condemn the wicked;
025:002 and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
        before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.
025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he
        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
        then your brother should seem vile to you.
025:004 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out [the grain].
025:005 If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son,
        the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger:
        her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him
        as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
025:006 It shall be, that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed
        in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be
        blotted out of Israel.
025:007 If the man doesn't want to take his brother's wife, then his
        brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say,
        My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother
        a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's
        brother to me.
025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him:
        and if he stand, and say, I don't want to take her;
025:009 then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence
        of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit
        in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done
        to the man who does not build up his brother's house.
025:010 His name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has
        his shoe untied.
025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife
        of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand
        of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes
        him by the secrets;
025:012 then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall have no pity.
025:013 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great
        and a small.
025:014 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great
        and a small.
025:015 A perfect and just weight shall you have; a perfect and just
        measure shall you have:  that your days may be long in the land
        which Yahweh your God gives you.
025:016 For all who do such things, [even] all who do unrighteously,
        are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
025:017 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth
        out of Egypt;
025:018 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you,
        all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary;
        and he didn't fear God.
025:019 Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you
        rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which
        Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,
        that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky;
        you shall not forget.
026:001 It shall be, when you are come in to the land which Yahweh
        your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it,
        and dwell therein,
026:002 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground,
        which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God
        gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go
        to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell there.
026:003 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days,
        and tell him, I profess this day to Yahweh your God,
        that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers
        to give us.
026:004 The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it
        down before the altar of Yahweh your God.
026:005 You shall answer and say before Yahweh your God, A Syrian
        ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt,
        and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there
        a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
026:006 The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid
        on us hard bondage:
026:007 and we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers, and Yahweh
        heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil,
        and our oppression;
026:008 and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror,
        and with signs, and with wonders;
026:009 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
026:010 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground,
        which you, Yahweh, have given me.  You shall set it down
        before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.
026:011 You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God
        has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite,
        and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.
026:012 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your
        increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing,
        then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner,
        to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within
        your gates, and be filled.
026:013 You shall say before Yahweh your God, I have put away the holy
        things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite,
        and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
        according to all your commandment which you have commanded me:
        I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have
        I forgotten them:
026:014 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put
        away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead:
        I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done
        according to all that you have commanded me.
026:015 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless
        your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us,
        as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
026:016 This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes
        and ordinances:  you shall therefore keep and do them with all
        your heart, and with all your soul.
026:017 You have declared Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would
        walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments,
        and his ordinances, and listen to his voice:
026:018 and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his
        own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should
        keep all his commandments;
026:019 and to make you high above all nations that he has made,
        in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be
        a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
027:001 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,
        Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.
027:002 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan
        to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall
        set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
027:003 and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you
        are passed over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh
        your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
027:004 It shall be, when you are passed over the Jordan, that you
        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day,
        in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
027:005 There shall you build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar
        of stones:  you shall lift up no iron [tool] on them.
027:006 You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones;
        and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:
027:007 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there;
        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.
027:008 You shall write on the stones all the words of this
        law very plainly.
027:009 Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying,
        Keep silence, and listen, Israel:  this day you are become
        the people of Yahweh your God.
027:010 You shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God,
        and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command
        you this day.
027:011 Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
027:012 These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people,
        when you are passed over the Jordan:  Simeon, and Levi,
        and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.
027:013 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse:  Reuben, Gad,
        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
027:014 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Israel
        with a loud voice,
027:015 Cursed be the man who makes an engraved or molten image,
        an abomination to Yahweh, the work of the hands of the craftsman,
        and sets it up in secret.  All the people shall answer
        and say, Amen.
027:016 Cursed be he who sets light by his father or his mother.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:017 Cursed be he who removes his neighbor's landmark.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:018 Cursed be he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:019 Cursed be he who wrests the justice [due] to the foreigner,
        fatherless, and widow.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:020 Cursed be he who lies with his father's wife, because he has
        uncovered his father's skirt.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:021 Cursed be he who lies with any manner of animal.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:022 Cursed be he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father,
        or the daughter of his mother.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:023 Cursed be he who lies with his mother-in-law. All the people
        shall say, Amen.
027:024 Cursed be he who strikes his neighbor in secret.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:025 Cursed be he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:026 Cursed be he who doesn't confirm the words of this law to do them.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
028:001 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice
        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments
        which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God will set
        you on high above all the nations of the earth:
028:002 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you,
        if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
028:003 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be
        in the field.
028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,
        and the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock,
        and the young of your flock.
028:005 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
028:006 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you
        be when you go out.
028:007 Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be
        struck before you:  they shall come out against you one way,
        and shall flee before you seven ways.
028:008 Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns,
        and in all that you put your hand to; and he will bless you
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
028:009 Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself,
        as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the commandments
        of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways.
028:010 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called
        by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be afraid of you.
028:011 Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body,
        and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground,
        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you.
028:012 Yahweh will open to you his good treasure in the sky,
        to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all
        the work of your hand:  and you shall lend to many nations,
        and you shall not borrow.
028:013 Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail;
        and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath;
        if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God,
        which I command you this day, to observe and to do [them],
028:014 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I
        command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left,
        to go after other gods to serve them.
028:015 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments
        and his statutes which I command you this day, that all
        these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.
028:016 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be
        in the field.
028:017 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,
        the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.
028:019 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you
        be when you go out.
028:020 Yahweh will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke,
        in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed,
        and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings,
        by which you have forsaken me.
028:021 Yahweh will make the pestilence cleave to you, until he has
        consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.
028:022 Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever,
        and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword,
        and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you
        until you perish.
028:023 Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth
        that is under you shall be iron.
028:024 Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust:
        from the sky shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed.
028:025 Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies;
        you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven
        ways before them:  and you shall be tossed back and forth
        among all the kingdoms of the earth.
028:026 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky,
        and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none
        to frighten them away.
028:027 Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors,
        and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can
        not be healed.
028:028 Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness,
        and with astonishment of heart;
028:029 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes
        in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways:
        and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there
        shall be none to save you.
028:030 You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
        you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein:
        you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use the fruit of it.
028:031 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall
        not eat of it:  your donkey shall be violently taken away
        from before your face, and shall not be restored to you:
        your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall
        have none to save you.
028:032 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people;
        and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
        the day:  and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.
028:033 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation
        which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed
        and crushed always;
028:034 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which
        you shall see.
028:035 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs,
        with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole
        of your foot to the crown of your head.
028:036 Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you,
        to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers;
        and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
028:037 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
        among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away.
028:038 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather
        little in; for the locust shall consume it.
028:039 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall
        neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes];
        for the worm shall eat them.
028:040 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders,
        but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive
        shall cast [its fruit].
028:041 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours;
        for they shall go into captivity.
028:042 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
028:043 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above
        you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
028:044 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him:
        he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
028:045 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you,
        and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't
        listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments
        and his statutes which he commanded you:
028:046 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder,
        and on your seed forever.
028:047 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness,
        and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance
        of all things;
028:048 therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send
        against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
        and in want of all things:  and he shall put a yoke of iron
        on your neck, until he have destroyed you.
028:049 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end
        of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language
        you shall not understand;
028:050 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard
        the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
028:051 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of
        your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave
        you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock,
        or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
028:052 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high
        and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted,
        throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all
        your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God
        has given you.
028:053 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons
        and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you,
        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies
        shall distress you.
028:054 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall
        be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom,
        and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;
028:055 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
        children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him,
        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall
        distress you in all your gates.
028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure
        to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness
        and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband
        of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
028:057 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet,
        and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall
        eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege
        and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you
        in your gates.
028:058 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that
        are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious
        and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;
028:059 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues
        of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,
        and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
028:060 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt,
        which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.
028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written
        in the book of this law, them will Yahweh bring on you,
        until you are destroyed.
028:062 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars
        of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God.
028:063 It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good,
        and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause
        you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked
        from off the land where you go in to possess it.
028:064 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one
        end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
        and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known,
        you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
028:065 Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there
        shall be no rest for the sole of your foot:  but Yahweh
        will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
        and pining of soul;
028:066 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall
        fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
028:067 In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even
        you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your
        heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes
        which you shall see.
028:068 Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way
        of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again:
        and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for
        bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
029:001 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded
        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
        besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
029:002 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen
        all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt
        to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
029:003 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs,
        and those great wonders:
029:004 but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see,
        and ears to hear, to this day.
029:005 I have led you forty years in the wilderness:  your clothes
        have not grown old on you, and your shoe has not grown old
        on your foot.
029:006 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink;
        that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.
029:007 When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle,
        and we struck them:
029:008 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance
        to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe
        of the Manassites.
029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them,
        that you may prosper in all that you do.
029:010 You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God;
        your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers,
        even all the men of Israel,
029:011 your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is
        in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood
        to the one who draws your water;
029:012 that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day;
029:013 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people,
        and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you,
        and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob.
029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
029:015 but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh
        our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day
029:016 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came
        through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
029:017 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols,
        wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
029:018 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family,
        or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God,
        to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should
        be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
029:019 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse,
        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,
        though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy
        the moist with the dry.
029:020 Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh
        and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all
        the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him,
        and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.
029:021 Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel,
        according to all the curses of the covenant that is written
        in this book of the law.
029:022 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you,
        and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say,
        when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses
        with which Yahweh has made it sick;
029:023 [and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning,
        [that] it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein,
        like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,
        which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
029:024 even all the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus
        to this land? what means the heat of this great anger?
029:025 Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh,
        the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought
        them forth out of the land of Egypt,
029:026 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that
        they didn't know, and that he had not given to them:
029:027 therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land,
        to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;
029:028 and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath,
        and in great indignation, and cast them into another land,
        as at this day.
029:029 The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things
        that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever,
        that we may do all the words of this law.
030:001 It shall happen, when all these things are come on you,
        the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you,
        and you shall call them to mind among all the nations,
        where Yahweh your God has driven you,
030:002 and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice
        according to all that I command you this day, you and your children,
        with all your heart, and with all your soul;
030:003 that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have
        compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all
        the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.
030:004 If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of
        the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather you,
        and from there he will bring you back:
030:005 and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your
        fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do
        you good, and multiply you above your fathers.
030:006 Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart
        of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, that you may live.
030:007 Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies,
        and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
030:008 You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his
        commandments which I command you this day.
030:009 Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work
        of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit
        of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good:
        for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced
        over your fathers;
030:010 if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his
        commandments and his statutes which are written in this book
        of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul.
030:011 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not
        too hard for you, neither is it far off.
030:012 It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up
        for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,
        that we may do it?
030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go
        over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,
        that we may do it?
030:014 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart,
        that you may do it.
030:015 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good,
        and death and evil;
030:016 in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God,
        to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
        statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply,
        and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you
        go in to possess it.
030:017 But if your heart turn away, and you will not hear, but shall
        be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
030:018 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish;
        you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass
        over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
030:019 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I
        have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse:
        therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;
030:020 to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cleave to him;
        for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you
        may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
        to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
031:001 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
031:002 He said to them, I am one hundred twenty years old this day;
        I can no more go out and come in:  and Yahweh has said to me,
        You shall not go over this Jordan.
031:003 Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy
        these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them:
        [and] Joshua, he shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
031:004 Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings
        of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.
031:005 Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them
        according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
031:006 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid, nor be scared
        of them:  for Yahweh your God, he it is who does go with you;
        he will not fail you, nor forsake you.
031:007 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of
        all Israel, Be strong and of good courage:  for you shall
        go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn
        to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them
        to inherit it.
031:008 Yahweh, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you,
        he will not fail you, neither forsake you:  don't be afraid,
        neither be dismayed.
031:009 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons
        of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and to all the elders of Israel.
031:010 Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years,
        in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,
031:011 when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God
        in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law
        before all Israel in their hearing.
031:012 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones,
        and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they
        may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God,
        and observe to do all the words of this law;
031:013 and that their children, who have not known, may hear,
        and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live
        in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
031:014 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die:
        call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting,
        that I may give him a charge.  Moses and Joshua went,
        and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
031:015 Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud:
        and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
031:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers;
        and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after
        the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them,
        and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
        made with them.
031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,
        and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them,
        and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles
        shall come on them; so that they will say in that day,
        Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?
031:018 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they
        shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
031:019 Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it
        the children of Israel:  put it in their mouths, that this
        song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I
        swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey,
        and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat;
        then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me,
        and break my covenant.
031:021 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,
        that this song shall testify before them as a witness;
        for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:
        for I know their imagination which they frame this day,
        before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
031:022 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.
031:023 He gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said,
        Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring
        the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them:
        and I will be with you.
031:024 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
        of this law in a book, until they were finished,
031:025 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh, saying,
031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there
        for a witness against you.
031:027 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck:  behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious
        against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?
031:028 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
        that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven
        and earth to witness against them.
031:029 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves,
        and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;
        and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you
        will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
        him to anger through the work of your hands.
031:030 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words
        of this song, until they were finished.
032:001 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear
        the words of my mouth.
032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain.  My speech shall
        condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass,
        as the showers on the herb.
032:003 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh.  Ascribe greatness
        to our God!
032:004 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice:
        a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.
032:005 They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not
        his children, [it is] their blemish.  [They are] a perverse
        and crooked generation.
032:006 Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise?
        Isn't he your father who has bought you?  He has made you,
        and established you.
032:007 Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.
        Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they
        will tell you.
032:008 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of
        the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
032:009 For Yahweh's portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot
        of his inheritance.
032:010 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness.
        He surrounded him.  He cared for him.  He kept him as the apple
        of his eye.
032:011 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young,
        he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them
        on his feathers.
032:012 Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.
032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
        He ate the increase of the field.  He caused him to suck
        honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
032:014 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of
        the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat.
        Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
032:015 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.
        You have grown thick.  You have become sleek.
        Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock
        of his salvation.
032:016 They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked
        him to anger with abominations.
032:017 They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods
        that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late,
        which your fathers didn't dread.
032:018 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,
        and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
032:019 Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation
        of his sons and his daughters.
032:020 He said, I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their
        end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation,
        children in whom is no faithfulness.
032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.
        They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.
        I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
        I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
032:022 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest
        Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets
        the foundations of the mountains on fire.
032:023 I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.
032:024 [They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat and bitter destruction.  I will send the teeth of animals
        on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
032:025 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both
        young man and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired man.
032:026 I said, I would scatter them afar.  I would make the memory
        of them to cease from among men;
032:027 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
        lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say,
        Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.
032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no
        understanding in them.
032:029 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!
032:030 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
        to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had
        delivered them up?
032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies
        themselves being judges.
032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.
        Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.
032:033 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.
032:034 Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
032:035 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their
        foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand.
        The things that are to come on them shall make haste.
032:036 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone,
        There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.
032:037 He will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which
        they took refuge;
032:038 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine
        of their drink offering?  Let them rise up and help you!
        Let them be your protection.
032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me.
        I kill, and I make alive.  I wound, and I heal.
        There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,
032:041 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment;
        I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense
        those who hate me.
032:042 I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall
        devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,
        from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
032:043 Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge
        the blood of his servants.  He will render vengeance
        to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land,
        for his people.
032:044 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears
        of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
032:045 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
032:046 He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I
        testify to you this day, which you shall command your children
        to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.
032:047 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,
        and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land,
        where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
032:048 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
032:049 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,
        which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho;
        and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children
        of Israel for a possession;
032:050 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered
        to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor,
        and was gathered to his people:
032:051 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children
        of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness
        of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of
        the children of Israel.
032:052 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go
        there into the land which I give the children of Israel.
033:001 This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed
        the children of Israel before his death.
033:002 He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.
        He shone forth from Mount Paran.  He came from the ten thousands
        of holy ones.  At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
033:003 Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.
        They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive
        of your words.
033:004 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
033:005 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered,
        All the tribes of Israel together.
033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.
033:007 This is [the blessing] of Judah:  and he said, Hear, Yahweh,
        the voice of Judah.  Bring him in to his people.
        With his hands he contended for himself.  You shall be a help
        against his adversaries.
033:008 Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your
        godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove
        at the waters of Meribah;
033:009 who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
        Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know
        his own children:  For they have observed your word,
        and keep your covenant.
033:010 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law.
        They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering
        on your altar.
033:011 Yahweh, bless his substance.  Accept the work of his hands.
        Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,
        of those who hate him, that they not rise again.
033:012 Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell
        in safety by him.  He covers him all the day long.
        He dwells between his shoulders.
033:013 Of Joseph he said, His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the
        precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep
        that couches beneath,
033:014 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious
        things of the growth of the moons,
033:015 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious
        things of the everlasting hills,
033:016 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
        the good will of him who lived in the bush{i. e.
        the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.}. Let [the blessing] come
        on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was
        separate from his brothers.
033:017 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.  His horns are
        the horns of the wild ox.  With them he shall push the peoples
        all of them, [even] the ends of the earth:  They are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim.  They are the thousands of Manasseh.
033:018 Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
        and Issachar, in your tents.
033:019 They shall call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will
        offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out
        the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.
033:020 Of Gad he said, He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
        He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown
        of the head.
033:021 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's
        portion reserved.  He came [with] the heads of the people.
        He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.
033:022 Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.
033:023 Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of
        the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.
033:024 Of Asher he said, Asher is blessed with children.
        Let him be acceptable to his brothers.  Let him dip his
        foot in oil.
033:025 Your bars shall be iron and brass.  As your days, so shall
        your strength be.
033:026 There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens
        for your help, In his excellency on the skies.
033:027 The eternal God is [your] dwelling place.  Underneath are
        the everlasting arms.  He thrust out the enemy from before you,
        and said, Destroy.
033:028 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land
        of grain and new wine.  Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
033:029 You are happy, Israel.  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,
        the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency!
        Your enemies shall submit themselves to you.  You shall tread
        on their high places.
034:001 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,
        to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.
        Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
034:002 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,
        and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
034:003 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city
        of palm trees, to Zoar.
034:004 Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed:
        I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall
        not go over there.
034:005 So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab,
        according to the word of Yahweh.
034:006 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against
        Beth Peor:  but no man knows of his tomb to this day.
034:007 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
034:008 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
        thirty days:  so the days of weeping in the mourning for
        Moses were ended.
034:009 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands on him:  and the children of Israel
        listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
034:010 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,
        whom Yahweh knew face to face,
034:011 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do
        in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,
034:012 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror,
        which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.
Book 06 Joshua
001:001 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,
        that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
        you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them,
        even to the children of Israel.
001:003 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will
        tread on, as I told Moses.
001:004 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river,
        the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
        and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
        shall be your border.
001:005 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
        As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  I will not fail
        you nor forsake you.
001:006 Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this
        people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers
        to give them.
001:007 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according
        to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you.
        Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left,
        that you may have good success wherever you go.
001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth,
        but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may
        observe to do according to all that is written therein:
        for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you
        shall have good success.
001:009 Haven't I commanded you?  Be strong and of good courage.
        Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:  for Yahweh your God
        is with you wherever you go.
001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
001:011 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people,
        saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass
        over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh
        your God gives you to possess it.'"
001:012 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to
        the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
001:013 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh
        commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God gives you rest,
        and will give you this land.
001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live
        in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you
        shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty
        men of valor, and shall help them
001:015 until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you,
        and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God
        gives them.  Then you shall return to the land of your possession,
        and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you
        beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"
001:016 They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us
        we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
001:017 Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you.
        Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
001:018 Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your
        words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death.
        Only be strong and of good courage."
002:001 Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim
        as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, and Jericho."
        They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name
        was Rahab, and slept there.
002:002 The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children
        of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."
002:003 The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men
        who have come to you, who have entered into your house;
        for they have come to spy out all the land."
002:004 The woman took the two men and hid them.  Then she said, "Yes,
        the men came to me, but I didn't know where they came from.
002:005 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it
        was dark, that the men went out.  Where the men went, I don't know.
        Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."
002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with
        the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.
002:007 The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords:
        and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out,
        they shut the gate.
002:008 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
002:009 and she said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given
        you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us,
        and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
002:010 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the
        Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} before you, when you came out of Egypt;
        and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
002:011 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did
        there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you:
        for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above,
        and on earth beneath.
002:012 Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt
        kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my
        father's house, and give me a true token;
002:013 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers,
        and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver
        our lives from death."
002:014 The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk
        about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."
002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window;
        for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived
        on the wall.
002:016 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you;
        and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers
        have returned.  Afterward, you may go your way."
002:017 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath
        which you have made us to swear.
002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by.
        You shall gather to yourself into the house your father,
        your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
002:019 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into
        the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless.
        Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head,
        if any hand is on him.
002:020 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall
        be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
002:021 She said, "According to your words, so be it."  She sent them away,
        and they departed.  She tied the scarlet line in the window.
002:022 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days,
        until the pursuers had returned.  The pursuers sought them
        throughout all the way, but didn't find them.
002:023 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain,
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told
        him all that had happened to them.
002:024 They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands
        all the land.  Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt
        away before us."
003:001 Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim,
        and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel.
        They lodged there before they passed over.
003:002 It happened after three days, that the officers went through
        the midst of the camp;
003:003 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests
        the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,
        and follow it.
003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure.  Don't come near to it, that you
        may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed
        this way before."
003:005 Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow
        Yahweh will do wonders among you."
003:006 Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark
        of the covenant, and pass over before the people."
        They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
003:007 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you
        in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I
        was with Moses, so I will be with you.
003:008 You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant,
        saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan,
        you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
003:009 Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear
        the words of Yahweh your God."
003:010 Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite,
        and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out
        from before you.
003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
        passes over before you into the Jordan.
003:012 Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        for every tribe a man.
003:013 It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests
        who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth,
        rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan
        will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;
        and they shall stand in one heap."
003:014 It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass
        over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        being before the people,
003:015 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,
        and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped
        in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its
        banks all the time of harvest),
003:016 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose
        up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is
        beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea
        of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off.
        Then the people passed over right against Jericho.
003:017 The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
        stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan;
        and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation
        had passed completely over the Jordan.
004:001 It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over
        the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:002 "Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
004:003 and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of
        the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm,
        twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them
        down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"
004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared
        of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
004:005 Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your
        God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up
        a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number
        of the tribes of the children of Israel;
004:006 that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'
004:007 then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan
        were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
        When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were
        cut off.  These stones shall be for a memorial to the children
        of Israel forever.'"
004:008 The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve
        stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua,
        according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
        and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged,
        and laid them down there.
004:009 Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,
        in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark
        of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
004:010 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan,
        until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak
        to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua;
        and the people hurried and passed over.
004:011 It happened, when all the people had completely passed over,
        that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the priests,
        in the presence of the people.
004:012 The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,
        as Moses spoke to them.
004:013 About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed
        over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
004:014 On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
        and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days
        of his life.
004:015 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:016 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony,
        that they come up out of the Jordan."
004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out
        of the Jordan!"
004:018 It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground,
        that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place,
        and went over all its banks, as before.
004:019 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day
        of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east
        border of Jericho.
004:020 Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of
        the Jordan, n Gilgal.
004:021 He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your
        children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do
        these stones mean?'
004:022 Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came
        over this Jordan on dry land.
004:023 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from
        before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh your God
        did to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, which he dried up
        from before us, until we had passed over;
004:024 that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh,
        that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.'"
005:001 It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites,
        who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up
        the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,
        until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was
        there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
005:002 At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make flint knives,
        and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."
005:003 Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
005:004 This is the reason Joshua circumcised:  all the people who came
        out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war,
        died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
005:005 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all
        the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
        until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt,
        were consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh.
        Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land
        which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
005:007 Their children, whom he raised up in their place,
        were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,
        because they had not circumcised them on the way.
005:008 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation,
        that they stayed in their places in the camp until
        they were healed.
005:009 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach
        of Egypt from off you."  Therefore the name of that place
        was called Gilgal,{"Gilgal" sounds like the Hebrew for "roll."
        } to this day.
005:010 The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.  They kept
        the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening
        in the plains of Jericho.
005:011 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce
        of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.
005:012 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce
        of the land.  The children of Israel didn't have manna any more;
        but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
005:013 It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
        his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him
        with his sword drawn in his hand.  Joshua went to him,
        and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
005:014 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army."
        Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped,
        and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
005:015 The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes
        off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy."
        Joshua did so.
006:001 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel.
        No one went out, and no one came in.
006:002 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand,
        with its king and the mighty men of valor.
006:003 All your men of war shall march around the city, going around
        the city once.  You shall do this six days.
006:004 Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark.  On the seventh day, you shall march around the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
006:005 It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn,
        and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people
        shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city
        shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man
        straight before him."
006:006 Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them,
        "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear
        seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."
006:007 They said to the people, "Advance!  March around the city,
        and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."
006:008 It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people,
        the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets;
        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.
006:009 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets,
        and the ark went after them.  The trumpets sounded as they went.
006:010 Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout,
        nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed
        out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout.
        Then you shall shout."
006:011 So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city,
        going about it once.  Then they came into the camp, and lodged
        in the camp.
006:012 Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of Yahweh.
006:013 The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually,
        and blew the trumpets:  and the armed men went before them.
        The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh.  The trumpets
        sounded as they went.
006:014 The second day they marched around the city once, and returned
        into the camp.  They did this six days.
006:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning
        of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times.
        Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.
006:016 It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,
        Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh has given
        you the city!
006:017 The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.
        Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with
        her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
006:018 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing,
        lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing;
        so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are holy to Yahweh.  They shall come into Yahweh's treasury."
006:020 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
        It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
        that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall
        fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.
006:021 They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey,
        with the edge of the sword.
006:022 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land,
        "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there
        the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."
006:023 The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab
        with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had.
        They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them
        outside of the camp of Israel.
006:024 They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.
        Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass
        and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.
006:025 But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all
        that she had, Joshua saved alive.  She lived in the midst
        of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers,
        whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
006:026 Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be
        the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho.
        With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation,
        and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
006:027 So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing;
        for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son
        of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing:
        and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the children of Israel.
007:002 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven,
        on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up
        and spy out the land.  The men went up and spied out Ai.
007:003 They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there;
        for they are but few.
007:004 So there went up there of the people about three thousand men:
        and they fled before the men of Ai.
007:005 The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they
        chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck
        them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted,
        and became as water.
007:006 Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before
        the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel;
        and they put dust on their heads.
007:007 Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought
        this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been
        content and lived beyond the Jordan!
007:008 Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned
        their backs before their enemies!
007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will
        hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth:  and what will you do for your great name?
007:010 Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen
        on your face?
007:011 Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them:  yes, they have even taken
        of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also;
        and they have even put it among their own stuff.
007:012 Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies;
        they turn their backs before their enemies, because they
        are become accursed:  I will not be with you any more,
        except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.
007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves
        against tomorrow:  for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, There is
        a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not stand
        before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing
        from among you.
007:014 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes:
        and it shall be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come
        near by families; and the family which Yahweh shall take
        shall come near by households; and the household which Yahweh
        shall take shall come near man by man.
007:015 It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall
        be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has
        transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done
        folly in Israel.
007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
        near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
007:017 and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family
        of the Zerahites:  and he brought near the family of the Zerahites
        man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
007:018 and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan,
        the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah,
        of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
007:019 Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me
        now what you have done; don't hide it from me.
007:020 Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned
        against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
007:021 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle,
        and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
        of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them;
        and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,
        and the silver under it.
007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,
        it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
007:023 They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them
        to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel; and they laid
        them down before Yahweh.
007:024 Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
        and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had:
        and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
007:025 Joshua said, Why have you troubled us?  Yahweh shall
        trouble you this day.  All Israel stoned him with stones;
        and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
007:026 They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day;
        and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger.
        Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor"
        to this day.
008:001 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:
        take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up
        to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai,
        and his people, and his city, and his land;
008:002 You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king:
        only the spoil of it, and the livestock of it, shall you
        take for a prey to yourselves:  set you an ambush for the
        city behind it.
008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai:
        and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor,
        and sent them forth by night.
008:004 He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against
        the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city,
        but be all ready:
008:005 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.
        It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first,
        that we will flee before them;
008:006 and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them
        away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us,
        as at the first:  so we will flee before them;
008:007 and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of
        the city:  for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.
008:008 It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set
        the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh shall you do:
        behold, I have commanded you.
008:009 Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush,
        and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai:
        but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
008:010 Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,
        and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
008:011 All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him,
        went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped
        on the north side of Ai:  now there was a valley between
        him and Ai.
008:012 He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between
        Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
008:013 So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north
        of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city;
        and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
008:014 It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried
        and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against
        Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed,
        before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush
        against him behind the city.
008:015 Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
        and fled by the way of the wilderness.
008:016 All the people who were in the city were called together
        to pursue after them:  and they pursued after Joshua,
        and were drawn away from the city.
008:017 There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El, who didn't
        go out after Israel:  and they left the city open,
        and pursued after Israel.
008:018 Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in
        your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.
        Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand
        toward the city.
008:019 The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
        as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city,
        and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.
008:020 When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold,
        the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no
        power to flee this way or that way:  and the people who fled
        to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
008:021 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
        and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
        and killed the men of Ai.
008:022 The others came forth out of the city against them;
        so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,
        and some on that side:  and they struck them, so that they
        let none of them remain or escape.
008:023 The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
008:024 It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the
        inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they
        pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword,
        until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword.
008:025 All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand,
        even all the men of Ai.
008:026 For Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched
        out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the
        inhabitants of Ai.
008:027 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took
        for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh
        which he commanded Joshua.
008:028 So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation,
        to this day.
008:029 The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening:
        and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they
        took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance
        of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap
        of stones, to this day.
008:030 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in Mount Ebal,
008:031 as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel,
        as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar
        of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron:
        and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.
008:032 He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
008:033 All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges,
        stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests
        the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        as well the foreigner as the native; half of them in front
        of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal;
        as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first,
        that they should bless the people of Israel.
008:034 Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing
        and the curse, according to all that is written in the book
        of the law.
008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        didn't read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women,
        and the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.
009:001 It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,
        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore
        of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        heard of it;
009:002 that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.
009:003 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        to Jericho and to Ai,
009:004 they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they
        had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys,
        and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,
009:005 and old and patched shoes on their feet, and old garments on them;
        and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become moldy.
009:006 They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him,
        and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country:
        now therefore make you a covenant with us.
009:007 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you dwell among us;
        and how shall we make a covenant with you?
009:008 They said to Joshua, We are your servants.  Joshua said to them,
        Who are you? and from whence come you?
009:009 They said to him, From a very far country your servants
        are come because of the name of Yahweh your God:
        for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
009:010 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
        who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon,
        and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
009:011 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke
        to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your servants:
        and now make you a covenant with us.
009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry,
        and is become moldy:
009:013 and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold,
        they are torn:  and these our garments and our shoes are become
        old by reason of the very long journey.
009:014 The men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at
        the mouth of Yahweh.
009:015 Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them,
        to let them live:  and the princes of the congregation
        swore to them.
009:016 It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant
        with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors,
        and that they lived among them.
009:017 The children of Israel traveled, and came to their cities on
        the third day.  Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah,
        and Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.
009:018 The children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel.
        All the congregation murmured against the princes.
009:019 But all the princes said to all the congregation,
        We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel:
        now therefore we may not touch them.
009:020 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,
        because of the oath which we swore to them.
009:021 The princes said to them, Let them live:  so they became
        wood cutters and drawers of water to all the congregation,
        as the princes had spoken to them.
009:022 Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,
        Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you;
        when you dwell among us?
009:023 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be
        of you bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the house of my God.
009:024 They answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told your servants, how that Yahweh your God commanded
        his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to
        destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you;
        therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you,
        and have done this thing.
009:025 Now, behold, we are in your hand:  as it seems good and right
        to you to do to us, do.
009:026 So did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they didn't kill them.
009:027 That day Joshua made those wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day,
        in the place which he should choose.
010:001 Now it happened, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua
        had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done
        to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king;
        and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel,
        and were among them;
010:002 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,
        as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men of it were mighty.
010:003 Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron,
        and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish,
        and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
010:004 Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it
        has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
        the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,
        the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,
        they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon,
        and made war against it.
010:006 The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Don't slack your hand from your servants;
        come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us:
        for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill
        country are gathered together against us.
010:007 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
010:008 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them:  for I have delivered
        them into your hands; there shall not a man of them
        stand before you.
010:009 Joshua therefore came on them suddenly; [for] he went up
        from Gilgal all the night.
010:010 Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way
        of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah,
        and to Makkedah.
010:011 It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they
        were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down
        great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died:
        they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom
        the children of Israel killed with the sword.
010:012 Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel;
        and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still
        on Gibeon; You, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
010:013 The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation
        had avenged themselves of their enemies.  Isn't this written
        in the book of Jashar?  The sun stayed in the midst of the sky,
        and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.
010:014 There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh
        listened to the voice of a man:  for Yahweh fought for Israel.
010:015 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
010:016 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
010:017 It was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found,
        hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
010:018 Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it to keep them:
010:019 but don't stay; pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost
        of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities:
        for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.
010:020 It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
        made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter,
        until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained
        of them had entered into the fortified cities,
010:021 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at
        Makkedah in peace:  none moved his tongue against any of
        the children of Israel.
010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth
        those five kings to me out of the cave.
010:023 They did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out
        of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
010:024 It happened, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua,
        that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him,
        Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.
        They came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.
010:025 Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed;
        be strong and of good courage:  for thus shall Yahweh do
        to all your enemies against whom you fight.
010:026 Afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged
        them on five trees:  and they were hanging on the trees
        until the evening.
010:027 It happened at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,
        and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
010:028 Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king of it:  he utterly destroyed them
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining;
        and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the
        king of Jericho.
010:029 Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah,
        and fought against Libnah:
010:030 and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand
        of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining in it;
        and he did to the king of it as he had done to the king of Jericho.
010:031 Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish,
        and encamped against it, and fought against it:
010:032 and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel;
        and he took it on the second day, and struck it with
        the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were therein,
        according to all that he had done to Libnah.
010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
010:034 Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon;
        and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
010:035 and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword; and all the souls who were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
010:036 Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron;
        and they fought against it:
010:037 and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls
        who were therein; he left none remaining, according to all
        that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it,
        and all the souls who were therein.
010:038 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir,
        and fought against it:
010:039 and he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it;
        and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
        destroyed all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining:
        as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king of it;
        as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king of it.
010:040 So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South,
        and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings:
        he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed,
        as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.
010:041 Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all
        the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
010:042 All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
        because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
010:043 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
011:001 It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent
        to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron,
        and to the king of Achshaph,
011:002 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country,
        and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland,
        and in the heights of Dor on the west,
011:003 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite,
        and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the
        hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
011:004 They went out, they and all their armies with them, much people,
        even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude,
        with horses and chariots very many.
011:005 All these kings met together; and they came and encamped
        together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
011:006 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them;
        for tomorrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel:  you shall hamstring their horses, and burn
        their chariots with fire.
011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
        by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.
011:008 Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
        and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim,
        and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they struck them,
        until they left them none remaining.
011:009 Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him:  he hamstrung their horses,
        and burnt their chariots with fire.
011:010 Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck
        the king of it with the sword:  for Hazor before was the head
        of all those kingdoms.
011:011 They struck all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword,
        utterly destroying them; there was none left who breathed:
        and he burnt Hazor with fire.
011:012 All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and he struck them with the edge of
        the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded.
011:013 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned
        none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
011:014 All the spoil of these cities, and the livestock, the children
        of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they
        struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,
        neither left they any who breathed.
011:015 As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua:
        and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South,
        and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah,
        and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
011:017 from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad
        in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon:  and all their
        kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death.
011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children
        of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
        they took all in battle.
011:020 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against
        Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them,
        that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:021 Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the
        hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from
        all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country
        of Israel:  Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
011:022 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children
        of Israel:  only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,
        did some remain.
011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh
        spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance
        to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
        The land had rest from war.
012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
        Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward
        the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,
        and all the Arabah eastward:
012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead,
        even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
012:003 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to
        the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way
        to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
012:004 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,
        who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
012:005 and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
012:006 Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:
        and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to
        the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
012:007 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children
        of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in
        the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir;
        and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession
        according to their divisions;
012:008 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,
        and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South;
        the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
012:009 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
012:010 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
012:011 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
012:012 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
012:013 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
012:014 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
012:015 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
012:016 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
012:017 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
012:018 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
012:019 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
012:020 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
012:021 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
012:022 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
012:023 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim
        in Gilgal, one;
012:024 the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.
013:001 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said
        to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there
        remains yet very much land to be possessed.
013:002 This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of
        the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
013:003 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border
        of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites;
        the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites,
        the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites;
        also the Avvim,
013:004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border
        of the Amorites;
013:005 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,
        from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;
013:006 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to
        Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive
        out from before the children of Israel:  only allot you it
        to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
013:008 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,
        which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses
        the servant of Yahweh gave them:
013:009 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all
        the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
013:010 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned
        in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
013:011 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
        and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
013:012 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim);
        for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.
013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,
        nor the Maacathites:  but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst
        of Israel to this day.
013:014 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance,
        as he spoke to him.
013:015 Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according
        to their families.
013:016 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
        of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
        and all the plain by Medeba;
013:017 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,
        and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,
013:018 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
013:019 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount
        of the valley,
013:020 and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,
013:021 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck
        with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur,
        and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel kill with the sword among the rest of their slain.
013:023 The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border
        [of it]. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben
        according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:024 Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,
        according to their families.
013:025 Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,
        and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that
        is before Rabbah;
013:026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
        to the border of Debir;
013:027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,
        and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part
        of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according
        to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:029 Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:
        and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families.
013:030 Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are
        in Bashan, sixty cities:
013:031 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir
        the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
        of Machir according to their families.
013:032 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains
        of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
013:033 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
014:001 These are the inheritances which the children of Israel
        took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
        and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        distributed to them,
014:002 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,
        for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and
        the half-tribe beyond the Jordan:  but to the Levites he gave
        no inheritance among them.
014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
        and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land,
        save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs of it for their
        livestock and for their substance.
014:005 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;
        and they divided the land.
014:006 Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:
        and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
        You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God
        concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.
014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent
        me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in my heart.
014:008 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.
014:009 Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and
        to your children forever, because you have wholly followed
        Yahweh my God.
014:010 Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,
        these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke
        this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness:
        and now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:
        as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
        and to go out and to come in.
014:012 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,
        and cities great and fortified:  it may be that Yahweh will
        be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
014:013 Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
014:014 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly
        followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
014:015 Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;
        [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim.
        The land had rest from war.
015:001 The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
        families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness
        of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
015:002 Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,
        from the bay that looks southward;
015:003 and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed
        along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea,
        and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned
        about to Karka;
015:004 and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook
        of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea:
        this shall be your south border.
015:005 The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.
        The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea
        at the end of the Jordan;
015:006 and the border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by
        the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone
        of Bohan the son of Reuben;
015:007 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against
        the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river;
        and the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh,
        and the goings out of it were at En Rogel;
015:008 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom
        to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem);
        and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies
        before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost
        part of the valley of Rephaim northward;
015:009 and the border extended from the top of the mountain
        to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to
        the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim);
015:010 and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,
        and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north
        (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh,
        and passed along by Timnah;
015:011 and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;
        and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along
        to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings
        out of the border were at the sea.
015:012 The west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it].
        This is the border of the children of Judah round about
        according to their families.
015:013 To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children
        of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua,
        even Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron).
015:014 Caleb drove out there the three sons of Anak:  Sheshai, and Ahiman,
        and Talmai, the children of Anak.
015:015 He went up there against the inhabitants of Debir:
        now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
015:016 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
015:017 Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
015:018 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said, What would you?
015:019 She said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.
015:021 The uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel,
        and Eder, and Jagur,
015:022 and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
015:023 and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
015:025 Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth, Hezron (the same is Hazor),
015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
015:027 and Hazar Gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth Pelet,
015:028 and Hazar Shual, and Beersheba, and Biziothiah,
015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
015:030 and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
015:031 and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
015:032 and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon:  all the cities
        are twenty-nine, with their villages.
015:033 In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
015:034 and Zanoah, and En Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
015:036 and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages.
015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal Gad,
015:038 and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
015:040 and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,
015:041 and Gederoth, Beth Dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah;
        sixteen cities with their villages.
015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
015:043 and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
015:044 and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities
        with their villages.
015:045 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
015:046 from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod,
        with their villages.
015:047 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and
        its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border [of it].
015:048 In the hill country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
015:049 and Dannah, and Kiriath Sannah (the same is Debir),
015:050 and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
015:051 and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
015:053 and Janim, and Beth Tappuah, and Aphekah,
015:054 and Humtah, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior;
        nine cities with their villages.
015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,
015:056 and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
015:057 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
015:058 Halhul, Beth Zur, and Gedor,
015:059 and Maarath, and Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities
        with their villages.
015:060 Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah;
        two cities with their villages.
015:061 In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
015:062 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities
        with their villages.
015:063 As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
        of Judah couldn't drive them out:  but the Jebusites dwell
        with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
016:001 The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan
        at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,
        even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill
        country to Bethel;
016:002 and it went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border
        of the Archites to Ataroth;
016:003 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites,
        to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to Gezer;
        and the goings out of it were at the sea.
016:004 The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
016:005 The border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was [thus]: the border of their inheritance eastward
        was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper;
016:006 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north;
        and the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh,
        and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
016:007 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah,
        and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
016:008 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook
        of Kanah; and the goings out of it were at the sea.
        This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
        according to their families;
016:009 together with the cities which were set apart for the children
        of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children
        of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
016:010 They didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer:
        but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day,
        and are become servants to do forced labor.
017:001 [This] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was
        the firstborn of Joseph.  As for Machir the firstborn
        of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
017:002 So [the lot] was for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families:  for the children of Abiezer,
        and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,
        and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher,
        and for the children of Shemida:  these were the male children
        of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,
        the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons,
        but daughters:  and these are the names of his daughters:
        Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
017:004 They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
        the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh commanded
        Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:
        therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them
        an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
017:005 There fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead
        and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
017:006 because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons.
        The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
017:007 The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is
        before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand,
        to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.
017:008 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on
        the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
017:009 The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook:
        these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh:
        and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook,
        and the goings out of it were at the sea:
017:010 southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north,
        and to Issachar on the east.
017:011 Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth Shean and its towns,
        and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns,
        and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't drive out [the inhabitants
        of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
017:013 It happened, when the children of Israel had grown strong,
        that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn't
        utterly drive them out.
017:014 The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you
        given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I
        am a great people, because hitherto Yahweh has blessed me?
017:015 Joshua said to them, If you are a great people, go up to the forest,
        and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites
        and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too
        narrow for you.
017:016 The children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us:
        and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have
        chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth Shean and its towns,
        and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
017:017 Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power;
        you shall not have one lot only:
017:018 but the hill country shall be yours; for though it is a forest,
        you shall cut it down, and the goings out of it shall be yours;
        for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have
        chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
018:001 The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there:
        and the land was subdued before them.
018:002 There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet divided their inheritance.
018:003 Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go
        in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you?
018:004 Appoint for you three men of each tribe:  and I will send them,
        and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe
        it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.
018:005 They shall divide it into seven portions:  Judah shall abide
        in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their border on the north.
018:006 You shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring
        [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you
        here before Yahweh our God.
018:007 For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood
        of Yahweh is their inheritance:  and Gad and Reuben and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
        beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of
        Yahweh gave them.
018:008 The men arose, and went:  and Joshua charged those who went
        to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,
        and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots
        for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.
018:009 The men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came
        to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
018:010 Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh:
        and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.
018:011 The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families:  and the border of their lot went
        out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
018:012 Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan;
        and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north,
        and went up through the hill country westward; and the goings
        out of it were at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
018:013 The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz
        (the same is Bethel), southward; and the border went down
        to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south
        of Beth Horon the lower.
018:014 The border extended [there], and turned about on the west
        quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before
        Beth Horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath Baal
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah:
        this was the west quarter.
018:015 The south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath Jearim;
        and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring
        of the waters of Nephtoah;
018:016 and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain
        that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is
        in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to
        the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward,
        and went down to En Rogel;
018:017 and it extended northward, and went out at En Shemesh, and went
        out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim;
        and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
018:018 and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward,
        and went down to the Arabah;
018:019 and the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward;
        and the goings out of the border were at the north
        bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan:
        this was the south border.
018:020 The Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter.
        This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin,
        by the borders of it round about, according to their families.
018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Beth Hoglah,
        and Emek Keziz,
018:022 and Beth Arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
018:023 and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
018:024 and Chephar Ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities
        with their villages:
018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
018:026 and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
018:027 and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
018:028 and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath,
        [and] Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
        This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according
        to their families.
019:001 The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe
        of the children of Simeon according to their families:
        and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance
        of the children of Judah.
019:002 They had for their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
019:003 and Hazar Shual, and Balah, and Ezem,
019:004 and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
019:005 and Ziklag, and Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar Susah,
019:006 and Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:

019:008 and all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South.  This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
019:009 Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance
        of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children
        of Judah was too much for them:  therefore the children
        of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
019:010 The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
        to their families; and the border of their inheritance
        was to Sarid;
019:011 and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached
        to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
019:012 and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to
        the border of Chisloth Tabor; and it went out to Daberath,
        and went up to Japhia;
019:013 and from there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin;
        and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah;
019:014 and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon;
        and the goings out of it were at the valley of Iphtah El;
019:015 and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
        twelve cities with their villages.
019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:017 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children
        of Issachar according to their families.

019:022 and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh;
        and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.
019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:024 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families.
019:025 Their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
019:026 and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to
        Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;
019:027 and it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached
        to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek
        and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
019:028 and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon;
019:029 and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre;
        and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out of it
        were at the sea by the region of Achzib;
019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:  twenty-two cities
        with their villages.
019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:032 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.
019:033 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim,
        and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the goings out
        of it were at the Jordan;
019:034 and the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out
        from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south,
        and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan
        toward the sunrise.

        and Chinnereth,
019:036 and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
019:037 and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En Hazor,
019:038 Iron, and Migdal El, Horem, and Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.
019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:040 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families.
019:041 The border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,

019:045 and Jehud, and Bene Berak, and Gath Rimmon,
019:046 and Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
019:047 The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them;
        for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem,
        and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.
019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:049 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance
        by the borders of it; and the children of Israel gave an
        inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
019:050 according to the commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city
        which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim;
        and he built the city, and lived therein.
019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
        the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes
        of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot
        in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.
        So they made an end of dividing the land.
020:001 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities
        of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,
020:003 that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly [and]
        unawares may flee there:  and they shall be to you for a refuge
        from the avenger of blood.
020:004 He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at
        the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause
        in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall
        take him into the city to them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.
020:005 If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck
        his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him before.
020:006 He shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest
        that shall be in those days:  then shall the manslayer return,
        and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city
        from whence he fled.
020:007 They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali,
        and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba
        (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
020:008 Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer
        in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
        and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
        in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
020:009 These were the appointed cities for all the children
        of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them,
        that whoever kills any person unwittingly might flee there,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood
        before the congregation.
021:001 Then came near the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites
        to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,
        and to the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of
        the children of Israel;
021:002 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in,
        with the suburbs of it for our livestock.
021:003 The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities
        with their suburbs.
021:004 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:
        and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
021:005 The rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
021:006 The children of Gershon had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher,
        and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe
        of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
021:007 The children of Merari according to their families had
        out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,
        and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
021:008 The children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities
        with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.
021:009 They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah,
        and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities
        which are [here] mentioned by name:
021:010 and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families
        of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi;
        for theirs was the first lot.
021:011 They gave them Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron), in the hill country of Judah,
        with the suburbs of it round about it.
021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages of it, gave they
        to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
021:013 To the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Libnah with its suburbs,
021:014 and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
021:015 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
021:016 and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs,
        [and] Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of
        those two tribes.
021:017 Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs,
        Geba with its suburbs,
021:018 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests,
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:020 The families of the children of Kohath, the Levites,
        even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
021:021 They gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country
        of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer
        with its suburbs,
021:022 and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth Horon with its suburbs;
        four cities.

021:025 Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs,
        and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
021:026 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children
        of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
021:027 To the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
        out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
021:028 Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs,

021:031 Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
021:032 Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammothdor with
        its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:034 To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites,
        out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs,
        and Kartah with its suburbs,
021:035 Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
021:036 Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz
        with its suburbs,
021:037 Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:038 Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
021:039 Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs;
        four cities in all.
021:040 All [these were] the cities of the children of Merari according
        to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites;
        and their lot was twelve cities.
021:041 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession
        of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities
        with their suburbs.
021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
        thus it was with all these cities.
021:043 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give
        to their fathers; and they possessed it, and lived therein.
021:044 Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore
        to their fathers:  and there stood not a man of all their
        enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies
        into their hand.
021:045 There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had
        spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
022:002 and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all
        that I commanded you:
022:003 you have not left your brothers these many days to this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your God.
022:004 Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke
        to them:  therefore now turn you, and get you to your tents,
        to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant
        of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.
022:005 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses
        the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
        and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went
        to their tents.
022:007 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        [inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half gave
        Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward;
        moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents,
        he blessed them,
022:008 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents,
        and with very much livestock, with silver, and with gold,
        and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing:
        divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.
022:009 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel
        out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land
        of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
022:010 When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land
        of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan,
        a great altar to look on.
022:011 The children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan,
        in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains
        to the children of Israel.
022:012 When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
        of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh,
        to go up against them to war.
022:013 The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
022:014 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for
        each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them
        head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.
022:015 They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad,
        and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead,
        and they spoke with them, saying,
022:016 Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass
        is this that you have committed against the God of Israel,
        to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you
        have built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?
022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we
        have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came
        a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,
022:018 that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? and it
        will be, seeing you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow
        he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
022:019 However, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh,
        in which Yahweh's tent dwells, and take possession among us:
        but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us,
        in building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.
022:020 Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing,
        and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
        didn't perish alone in his iniquity.
022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads
        of the thousands of Israel,
022:022 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows;
        and Israel he shall know:  if it be in rebellion, or if in
        trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),
022:023 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh;
        or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal offering,
        or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings thereon,
        let Yahweh himself require it;
022:024 and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this,
        [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might
        speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Yahweh,
        the God of Israel?
022:025 for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you,
        you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion
        in Yahweh:  so might your children make our children cease
        from fearing Yahweh.
022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
022:027 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our
        generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not tell
        our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.
022:028 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us
        or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say,
        Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;
        but it is a witness between us and you.
022:029 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh,
        and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar
        for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice,
        besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tent.
022:030 When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation,
        even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him,
        heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children
        of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.
022:031 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children
        of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,
        because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh:
        now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the
        hand of Yahweh.
022:032 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children
        of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan,
        to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
022:033 The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
        Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them
        to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad lived.
022:034 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
        the altar [Ed]: For, [said they], it is a witness between us
        that Yahweh is God.
023:001 It happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest
        to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua
        was old and well stricken in years;
023:002 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for
        their heads, and for their judges and for their officers,
        and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years:
023:003 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all
        these nations because of you; for Yahweh your God, he it
        is that has fought for you.
023:004 Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain,
        to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great
        sea toward the going down of the sun.
023:005 Yahweh your God, he will thrust them out from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess
        their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
023:006 Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn
        aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
023:007 that you not come among these nations, these that remain
        among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods,
        nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow
        down yourselves to them;
023:008 but cleave to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day.
023:009 For Yahweh has driven out from before you great nations and strong:
        but as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Yahweh your God,
        he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to you.
023:011 Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love
        Yahweh your God.
023:012 Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant
        of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make
        marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
023:013 know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive
        these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be
        a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides,
        and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this
        good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:014 Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
        and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
        that not one thing has failed of all the good things which
        Yahweh your God spoke concerning you; all are happen to you,
        not one thing has failed of it.
023:015 It shall happen, that as all the good things are come on you
        of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so will Yahweh bring
        on you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from
        off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:016 When you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods,
        and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Yahweh
        be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he has given to you.
024:001 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
        and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads,
        and for their judges, and for their officers; and they
        presented themselves before God.
024:002 Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River,
        even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor:
        and they served other gods.
024:003 I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him
        throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed,
        and gave him Isaac.
024:004 I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:  and I gave to Esau Mount Seir,
        to possess it:  and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
024:005 I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did in the midst of it:  and afterward I
        brought you out.
024:006 I brought your fathers out of Egypt:  and you came to the sea;
        and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots
        and with horsemen to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
024:007 When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between
        you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them,
        and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt:
        and you lived in the wilderness many days.
024:008 I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond
        the Jordan:  and they fought with you; and I gave them into
        your hand, and you possessed their land; and I destroyed them
        from before you.
024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought
        against Israel:  and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor
        to curse you;
024:010 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
        so I delivered you out of his hand.
024:011 You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho:  and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
024:012 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,
        even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword,
        nor with your bow.
024:013 I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities
        which you didn't build, and you dwell therein; of vineyards
        and olive groves which you didn't plant do you eat.
024:014 Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
        and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River,
        and in Egypt; and serve you Yahweh.
024:015 If it seem evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose you this day whom
        you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
        that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,
        in whose land you dwell:  but as for me and my house,
        we will serve Yahweh.
024:016 The people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh,
        to serve other gods;
024:017 for Yahweh our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers
        up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples
        through the midst of whom we passed;
024:018 and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites
        who lived in the land:  therefore we also will serve Yahweh;
        for he is our God.
024:019 Joshua said to the people, You can't serve Yahweh;
        for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your disobedience nor your sins.
024:020 If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will
        turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he has
        done you good.
024:021 The people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.
024:022 Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against
        yourselves that you have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him.
        They said, We are witnesses.
024:023 Now therefore put away, [said he], the foreign gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
024:024 The people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God will we serve,
        and to his voice will we listen.
024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
024:026 Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God;
        and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak
        that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.
024:027 Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
        a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh
        which he spoke to us:  it shall be therefore a witness against you,
        lest you deny your God.
024:028 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
024:029 It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
        the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
024:030 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,
        which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
024:031 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days
        of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work
        of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.
024:032 The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel
        of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor
        the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money:
        and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
024:033 Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill
        of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill
        country of Ephraim.
Book 07 Judges
001:001 It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel
        asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall go up for us first against
        the Canaanites, to fight against them?
001:002 Yahweh said, Judah shall go up:  behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand.
001:003 Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
        that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise
        will go with you into your lot.  So Simeon went with him.
001:004 Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the
        Perizzites into their hand:  and they struck of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men.
001:005 They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him,
        and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
001:006 But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,
        and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
001:007 Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their
        great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table:
        as I have done, so God has requited me."  They brought him
        to Jerusalem, and he died there.
001:008 The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
001:009 Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South,
        and in the lowland.
001:010 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they
        struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
001:011 From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir.
        (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)
001:012 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
001:013 Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
001:014 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said to her, What would you?
001:015 She said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
001:016 The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah
        into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad;
        and they went and lived with the people.
001:017 Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the
        Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        The name of the city was called Hormah.
001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon
        with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.
001:019 Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out [the inhabitants of]
        the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants
        of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
001:020 They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken:
        and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.
001:021 The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who
        inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children
        of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
001:022 The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel;
        and Yahweh was with them.
001:023 The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel.  (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.)
001:024 The watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city,
        and we will deal kindly with you.
001:025 He shown them the entrance into the city; and they struck
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go
        and all his family.
001:026 The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
        and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it
        to this day.
001:027 Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth Shean and
        its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and
        its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns;
        but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
001:028 It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put
        the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly
        drive them out.
001:029 Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer;
        but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
001:030 Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
        inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them,
        and became subject to forced labor.
001:031 Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants
        of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah,
        nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
001:032 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land; for they did not drive them out.
001:033 Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived
        among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
        nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath
        became subject to forced labor.
001:034 The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country;
        for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
001:035 but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon,
        and in Shaalbim:  yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,
        so that they became subject to forced labor.
001:036 The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim,
        from the rock, and upward.
002:001 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim.
        He said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought
        you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said,
        I will never break my covenant with you:
002:002 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land;
        you shall break down their altars.  But you have not listened
        to my voice:  why have you done this?
002:003 Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you;
        but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare to you.
002:004 It happened, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words
        to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up
        their voice, and wept.
002:005 They called the name of that place Bochim:  and they sacrificed
        there to Yahweh.
002:006 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel
        went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
002:007 The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen
        all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.
002:008 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one
        hundred ten years old.
002:009 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
002:010 Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, who didn't
        know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.
002:011 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
002:012 and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,
        of the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed
        themselves down to them:  and they provoked Yahweh to anger.
002:013 They forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
002:014 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered
        them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them;
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
002:015 Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them
        for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them:
        and they were sore distressed.
002:016 Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand
        of those who despoiled them.
002:017 Yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they played the
        prostitute after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them:
        they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their
        fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh;
        [but] they didn't do so.
002:018 When Yahweh raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge,
        and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
        of the judge:  for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning
        by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them.
002:019 But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back,
        and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following
        other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn't
        cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
002:020 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said,
        Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;
002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them
        of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
002:022 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their fathers did
        keep it, or not.
002:023 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily;
        neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
003:001 Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all
        the wars of Canaan;
003:002 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,
        to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:
003:003 [namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon,
        from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
003:004 They were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded
        their fathers by Moses.
003:005 The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites,
        and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites:
003:006 and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
003:007 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals
        and the Asheroth.
003:008 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia:
        and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.
003:009 When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
        up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them,
        even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
003:010 The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel;
        and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim
        king of Mesopotamia into his hand:  and his hand prevailed
        against Cushan Rishathaim.
003:011 The land had rest forty years.  Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
003:012 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab
        against Israel, because they had done that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh.
003:013 He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek;
        and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city
        of palm trees.
003:014 The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
003:015 But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
        them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
        a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him
        to Eglon the king of Moab.
003:016 Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length;
        and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.
003:017 He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab:  now Eglon was
        a very fat man.
003:018 When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away
        the people who bore the tribute.
003:019 But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal,
        and said, I have a secret errand to you, king.  He said,
        Keep silence.  All who stood by him went out from him.
003:020 Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool
        upper room.  Ehud said, I have a message from God to you.
        He arose out of his seat.
003:021 Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his body:
003:022 and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body;
        and it came out behind.
003:023 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors
        of the upper room on him, and locked them.
003:024 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw,
        and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said,
        Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
003:025 They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn't open
        the doors of the upper room:  therefore they took the key,
        and opened [them], and behold, their lord was fallen down dead
        on the earth.
003:026 Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries,
        and escaped to Seirah.
003:027 It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in
        the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the hill country, and he before them.
003:028 He said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your
        enemies the Moabites into your hand.  They went down after him,
        and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites,
        and didn't allow a man to pass over.
003:029 They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men,
        every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped
        not a man.
003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.
        The land had rest eighty years.
003:031 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck
        of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad:
        and he also saved Israel.
004:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.
004:002 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera,
        who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
004:003 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh:  for he had nine hundred
        chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed
        the children of Israel.
004:004 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time.
004:005 She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel
        in the hill country of Ephraim:  and the children of Israel
        came up to her for judgment.
004:006 She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, Hasn't Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, commanded, [saying], Go and draw to Mount Tabor,
        and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun?
004:007 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain
        of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into your hand.
004:008 Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go;
        but if you will not go with me, I will not go.
004:009 She said, I will surely go with you:  notwithstanding, the journey
        that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh
        will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.  Deborah arose,
        and went with Barak to Kedesh.
004:010 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh;
        and there went up ten thousand men at his feet:
        and Deborah went up with him.
004:011 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites,
        even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses,
        and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim,
        which is by Kedesh.
004:012 They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
        to Mount Tabor.
004:013 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
        chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him,
        from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
004:014 Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has
        delivered Sisera into your hand; hasn't Yahweh gone out before you?
        So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand
        men after him.
004:015 Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army,
        with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted
        from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army,
        to Harosheth of the Gentiles:  and all the army of Sisera
        fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
004:017 However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael
        the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin
        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
004:018 Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord,
        turn in to me; don't be afraid.  He came in to her into the tent,
        and she covered him with a rug.
004:019 He said to her, Please give me a little water to drink;
        for I am thirsty.  She opened a bottle of milk, and gave
        him drink, and covered him.
004:020 He said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be,
        when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there
        any man here? that you shall say, No.
004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer
        in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin
        into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground;
        for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
004:022 Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
        and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.
        He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent
        peg was in his temples.
004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before
        the children of Israel.
004:024 The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more
        against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed
        Jabin king of Canaan.
005:001 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
005:002 Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people
        offered themselves willingly, be blessed, Yahweh!
005:003 Hear, you kings!  Give ear, you princes!  I, [even] I,
        will sing to Yahweh.  I will sing praise to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel.
005:004 Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, when you marched out
        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
        Yes, the clouds dropped water.
005:005 The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, even Sinai,
        at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
        the highways were unoccupied.  The travelers walked through byways.
005:007 The rulers ceased in Israel.  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
        Until I arose a mother in Israel.
005:008 They chose new gods.  Then war was in the gates.  Was there
        a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered
        themselves willingly among the people.  Bless Yahweh!
005:010 Tell [of it], you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit
        on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.
005:011 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing
        water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts
        of Yahweh, [Even] the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
        Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah!  Awake, awake, utter a song!
        Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.
005:013 Then a remnant of the nobles [and] the people came down.
        Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.
005:014 Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you,
        Benjamin, among your peoples.  Governors come down out of Machir.
        Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zebulun.
005:015 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.  As was Issachar,
        so was Barak.  They rushed into the valley at his feet.
        By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.
005:016 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling
        for the flocks?  At the watercourses of Reuben There were
        great searchings of heart.
005:017 Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.  Why did Dan remain in ships?
        Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.
005:018 Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths;
        Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
005:019 The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at
        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.  They took no plunder of silver.
005:020 From the sky the stars fought.  From their courses,
        they fought against Sisera.
005:021 The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river,
        the river Kishon.  My soul, march on with strength.
005:022 Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings,
        the prancings of their strong ones.
005:023 Curse Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh.  Curse bitterly
        its inhabitants, because they didn't come to help Yahweh,
        to help Yahweh against the mighty.
005:024 Jael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Heber the Kenite;
        blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
005:025 He asked for water.  She gave him milk.  She brought him butter
        in a lordly dish.
005:026 She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to
        the workmen's hammer.  With the hammer she struck Sisera.
        She struck through his head.  Yes, she pierced and struck
        through his temples.
005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.  At her feet he bowed,
        he fell.  Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
005:028 Through the window she looked out, and cried:  Sisera's mother
        looked through the lattice.  Why is his chariot so long in coming?
        Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?
005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,
005:030 Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?  A lady,
        two ladies to every man; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,
        A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments
        embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
005:031 So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love
        him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength.
        The land had rest forty years.
006:001 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of
        Midian seven years.
006:002 The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of
        Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are
        in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
006:003 So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
        and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came
        up against them;
006:004 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase
        of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance
        in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
006:005 For they came up with their livestock and their tents;
        they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their
        camels were without number:  and they came into the land
        to destroy it.
006:006 Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children
        of Israel cried to Yahweh.
006:007 It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh
        because of Midian,
006:008 that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel:
        and he said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I
        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
        the house of bondage;
006:009 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
        and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them
        out from before you, and gave you their land;
006:010 and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not
        fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.
        But you have not listened to my voice.
006:011 The angel of Yahweh came, and sat under the oak which
        was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite:
        and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress,
        to hide it from the Midianites.
006:012 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him, and said to him,
        Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor.
006:013 Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then
        has all this happened to us? and where are all his wondrous
        works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Yahweh
        bring us up from Egypt? but now Yahweh has cast us off,
        and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
006:014 Yahweh looked at him, and said, Go in this your might,
        and save Israel from the hand of Midian:  have not I sent you?
006:015 He said to him, Oh, Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold,
        my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least
        in my father's house.
006:016 Yahweh said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall
        strike the Midianites as one man.
006:017 He said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight,
        then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
006:018 Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out
        my present, and lay it before you.  He said, I will wait
        until you come again.
006:019 Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
        of an ephah of meal:  the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
        the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak,
        and presented it.
006:020 The angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
        cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.
        He did so.
006:021 Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was
        in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes;
        and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh
        and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Yahweh departed
        out of his sight.
006:022 Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said,
        Alas, Lord Yahweh! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh
        face to face.
006:023 Yahweh said to him, Peace be to you; don't be afraid:
        you shall not die.
006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it
        Yahweh is Peace{or, Yahweh Shalom}: to this day it is still
        in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
006:025 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him,
        Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven years old,
        and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has,
        and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
006:026 and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold,
        in the orderly manner, and take the second bull, and offer
        a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you
        shall cut down.
006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh
        had spoken to him:  and it happened, because he feared his
        father's household and the men of the city, so that he could
        not do it by day, that he did it by night.
006:028 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
        the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut
        down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on
        the altar that was built.
006:029 They said one to another, Who has done this thing?
        When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son
        of Joash has done this thing.
006:030 Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son,
        that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal,
        and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
006:031 Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend
        for Baal?  Or will you save him? he who will contend for him,
        let him be put to death while [it is yet] morning:
        if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has
        broken down his altar.
006:032 Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
        contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.
006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children
        of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over,
        and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
006:034 But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet;
        and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
006:035 He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were
        gathered together after him:  and he sent messengers to Asher,
        and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
006:036 Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand,
        as you have spoken,
006:037 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor;
        if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground,
        then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand,
        as you have spoken.
006:038 It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed
        the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece,
        a bowl full of water.
006:039 Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me,
        and I will speak but this once:  Please let me make a trial
        just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on
        the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.
006:040 God did so that night:  for it was dry on the fleece only,
        and there was dew on all the ground.
007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him,
        rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod:
        and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them,
        by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
007:002 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are
        too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand,
        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand
        has saved me.
007:003 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is
        fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.
        There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there
        remained ten thousand.
007:004 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them
        down to the water, and I will try them for you there:
        and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you,
        the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you,
        This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
007:005 So he brought down the people to the water:  and Yahweh said
        to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue,
        as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise everyone
        who bows down on his knees to drink.
007:006 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
        was three hundred men:  but all the rest of the people bowed
        down on their knees to drink water.
007:007 Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped
        will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand;
        and let all the people go every man to his place.
007:008 So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets;
        and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent,
        but retained the three hundred men:  and the camp of Midian
        was beneath him in the valley.
007:009 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you
        down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
007:010 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant
        down to the camp:
007:011 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall
        your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp.
        Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost
        part of the armed men who were in the camp.
007:012 The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude;
        and their camels were without number, as the sand which is
        on the seashore for multitude.
007:013 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream
        to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream;
        and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp
        of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell,
        and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.
007:014 His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword
        of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:  into his hand
        God has delivered Midian, and all the army.
007:015 It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,
        and the interpretation of it, that he worshiped; and he returned
        into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has
        delivered into your hand the army of Midian.
007:016 He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put
        into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers,
        with torches within the pitchers.
007:017 He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise:  and behold,
        when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that,
        as I do, so shall you do.
007:018 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow
        you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say,
        For Yahweh and for Gideon.
007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him,
        came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning
        of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch:
        and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers
        that were in their hands.
007:020 The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers,
        and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets
        in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried,
        The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.
007:021 They stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.
007:022 They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every
        man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army;
        and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah,
        as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.
007:023 The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out
        of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
007:024 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country
        of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before
        them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
        So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took
        the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
007:025 They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they
        killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian:
        and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon
        beyond the Jordan.
008:001 The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you
        didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian?  They did
        chide with him sharply.
008:002 He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you?
        Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer?
008:003 God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb:  and what was I able to do in comparison with you?
        Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
008:004 Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
008:005 He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread
        to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am
        pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
008:006 The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
        now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?
008:007 Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna
        into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns
        of the wilderness and with briers.
008:008 He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner;
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of
        Succoth had answered.
008:009 He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again
        in peace, I will break down this tower.
008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them,
        about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army
        of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty
        thousand men who drew sword.
008:011 Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents
        on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army;
        for the army was secure.
008:012 Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them;
        and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna,
        and confused all the army.
008:013 Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from
        the ascent of Heres.
008:014 He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him:
        and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders
        of it, seventy-seven men.
008:015 He came to the men of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna,
        concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands
        of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give
        bread to your men who are weary?
008:016 He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness
        and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
008:017 He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
008:018 Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom you killed at Tabor?  They answered, As you are,
        so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
008:019 He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother:
        as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would
        not kill you.
008:020 He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them.
        But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he feared,
        because he was yet a youth.
008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us;
        for as the man is, so is his strength.  Gideon arose,
        and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that
        were on their camels' necks.
008:022 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us,
        both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you
        have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
008:023 Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall
        my son rule over you:  Yahweh shall rule over you.
008:024 Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you,
        that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil.
        (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
008:025 They answered, We will willingly give them.  They spread a garment,
        and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil.
008:026 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand
        and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, besides the crescents,
        and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on
        the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about
        their camels' necks.
008:027 Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah:
        and all Israel played the prostitute after it there;
        and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
008:028 So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they
        lifted up their heads no more.  The land had rest forty years
        in the days of Gideon.
008:029 Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
008:030 Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body;
        for he had many wives.
008:031 His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son,
        and he named him Abimelech.
008:032 Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried
        in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
008:033 It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
        Israel turned again, and played the prostitute after the Baals,
        and made Baal Berith their god.
008:034 The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God,
        who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies
        on every side;
008:035 neither shown they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
        [who is] Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
        shown to Israel.
009:001 Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his
        mother's brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family
        of the house of his mother's father, saying,
009:002 Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is
        better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are
        seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?
        Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
009:003 His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men
        of Shechem all these words:  and their hearts inclined
        to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
009:004 They gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of
        Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows,
        who followed him.
009:005 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers
        the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone:
        but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
        for he hid himself.
009:006 All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together,
        and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king,
        by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
009:007 When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top
        of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried,
        and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God
        may listen to you.
009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them;
        and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.
009:009 But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness,
        with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back
        and forth over the trees?
009:010 The trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
009:011 But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness,
        and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
009:012 The trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
009:013 The vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers
        God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
009:014 Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you,
        and reign over us.
009:015 The bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me
        king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade;
        and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour
        the cedars of Lebanon.
009:016 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously,
        in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt
        well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him
        according to the deserving of his hands
009:017 (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life,
        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
009:018 and you are risen up against my father's house this day,
        and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone,
        and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant,
        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
009:019 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal
        and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech,
        and let him also rejoice in you:
009:020 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour
        the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come
        out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
        and devour Abimelech.
009:021 Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there,
        for fear of Abimelech his brother.
009:022 Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
009:023 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;
        and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
009:024 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come,
        and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother,
        who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened
        his hands to kill his brothers.
009:025 The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains,
        and they robbed all who came along that way by them:
        and it was told Abimelech.
009:026 Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over
        to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
009:027 They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards,
        and trod [the grapes], and held festival, and went into the house
        of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
009:028 Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,
        that we should serve him?  Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul
        his officer? serve you the men of Hamor the father of Shechem:
        but why should we serve him?
009:029 Would that this people were under my hand! then would I
        remove Abimelech.  He said to Abimelech, Increase your army,
        and come out.
009:030 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
009:031 He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the
        son of Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and behold,
        they constrain the city [to take part] against you.
009:032 Now therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you,
        and lie in wait in the field:
009:033 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up,
        you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold,
        when he and the people who are with him come out against you,
        then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.
009:034 Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night,
        and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
009:035 Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of
        the gate of the city:  and Abimelech rose up, and the people
        who were with him, from the ambush.
009:036 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
        people down from the tops of the mountains.  Zebul said to him,
        You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
009:037 Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there come people down
        by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way
        of the oak of Meonenim.
009:038 Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, that you said,
        Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this
        the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray,
        and fight with them.
009:039 Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
009:040 Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell
        many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
009:041 Abimelech lived at Arumah:  and Zebul drove out Gaal and
        his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
009:042 It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field;
        and they told Abimelech.
009:043 He took the people, and divided them into three companies,
        and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold,
        the people came forth out of the city; He rose up against them,
        and struck them.
009:044 Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward,
        and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city:
        and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field,
        and struck them.
009:045 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
        the city, and killed the people who were therein:
        and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
009:046 When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it,
        they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
009:047 It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem
        were gathered together.
009:048 Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people
        who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,
        and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up,
        and laid it on his shoulder:  and he said to the people
        who were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste,
        and do as I have done.
009:049 All the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
        and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold,
        and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the men
        of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
        and took it.
009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled
        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut
        themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.
009:052 Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew
        near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
009:053 A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head,
        and broke his skull.
009:054 Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer,
        and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say
        of me, A woman killed him.  His young man thrust him through,
        and he died.
009:055 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
        every man to his place.
009:056 Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
        to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;
009:057 and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite
        on their heads:  and on them came the curse of Jotham
        the son of Jerubbaal.
010:001 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah,
        the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in Shamir
        in the hill country of Ephraim.
010:002 He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was
        buried in Shamir.
010:003 After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged
        Israel twenty-two years.
010:004 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they
        had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day,
        which are in the land of Gilead.
010:005 Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
010:006 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods
        of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods
        of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines;
        and they forsook Yahweh, and didn't serve him.
010:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand
        of the children of Ammon.
010:008 They vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year:
        eighteen years [oppressed they] all the children of Israel
        that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites,
        which is in Gilead.
010:009 The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also
        against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house
        of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
010:010 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, We have
        sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God,
        and have served the Baals.
010:011 Yahweh said to the children of Israel, Didn't I save you from
        the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon,
        and from the Philistines?
010:012 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
        did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out
        of their hand.
010:013 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods:
        therefore I will save you no more.
010:014 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save
        you in the time of your distress.
010:015 The children of Israel said to Yahweh, We have sinned:
        do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us,
        we pray you, this day.
010:016 They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh;
        and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
        in Gilead.  The children of Israel assembled themselves together,
        and encamped in Mizpah.
010:018 The people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another,
        What man is he who will begin to fight against the children
        of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor,
        and he was the son of a prostitute:  and Gilead became
        the father of Jephthah.
011:002 Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up,
        they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit
        in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman.
011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob:
        and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they
        went out with him.
011:004 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made
        war against Israel.
011:005 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
        the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
011:006 and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we
        may fight with the children of Ammon.
011:007 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Didn't you hate me,
        and drive me out of my father's house? and why are you come
        to me now when you are in distress?
011:008 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we
        turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight
        with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over
        all the inhabitants of Gilead.
011:009 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home
        again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver
        them before me, shall I be your head?
011:010 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness
        between us; surely according to your word so will we do.
011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
        made him head and chief over them:  and Jephthah spoke all
        his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
011:012 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,
        saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come to me
        to fight against my land?
011:013 The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers
        of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out
        of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan:
        now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.
011:014 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;
011:015 and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah:  Israel didn't take
        away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
011:016 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went
        through the wilderness to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        and came to Kadesh;
011:017 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let
        me pass through your land; but the king of Edom didn't listen.
        In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not:
        and Israel abode in Kadesh.
011:018 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land
        of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
        of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side
        of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab,
        for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
011:019 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass,
        we pray you, through your land to my place.
011:020 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border;
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz,
        and fought against Israel.
011:021 Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his
        people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them:
        so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants
        of that country.
011:022 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon
        even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
011:023 So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites
        from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?
011:024 Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?
        So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us,
        them will we possess.
011:025 Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor,
        king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did
        he ever fight against them?
011:026 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer
        and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side
        of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover
        them within that time?
011:027 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong
        to war against me:  Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day
        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
011:028 However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen
        to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
011:029 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed
        over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
011:030 Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
        deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
011:031 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors
        of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
        of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up
        for a burnt offering.
011:032 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight
        against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
011:033 He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty
        cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter.
        So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
011:034 Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter
        came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances:
        and she was his only child; besides her he had neither
        son nor daughter.
011:035 It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes,
        and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low,
        and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened
        my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go back.
011:036 She said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh;
        do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth,
        because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies,
        even on the children of Ammon.
011:037 She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me:
        let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on
        the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
011:038 He said, Go.  He sent her away for two months:
        and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her
        virginity on the mountains.
011:039 It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father,
        who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed:
        and she was a virgin.  It was a custom in Israel,
011:040 that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter
        of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
012:001 The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward;
        and they said to Jephthah, Why did you pass over to fight
        against the children of Ammon, and didn't call us to go
        with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.
012:002 Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife
        with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't
        save me out of their hand.
012:003 When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand,
        and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh
        delivered them into my hand:  why then are you come up to me
        this day, to fight against me?
012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead,
        and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim,
        because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites,
        in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.
012:005 The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites.
        It was so, that when [any of] the fugitives of Ephraim said,
        Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you
        an Ephraimite?  If he said, No;
012:006 then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth;
        for he couldn't manage to pronounce it right:  then they laid
        hold on him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan.
        There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.
012:007 Jephthah judged Israel six years.  Then died Jephthah the Gileadite,
        and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gilead.
012:008 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
012:009 He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad,
        and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons.
        He judged Israel seven years.
012:010 Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
012:011 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged
        Israel ten years.
012:012 Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
        land of Zebulun.
012:013 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
012:014 He had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, who rode on seventy
        donkey colts:  and he judged Israel eight years.
012:015 Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried
        in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country
        of the Amalekites.
013:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in
        the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand
        of the Philistines forty years.
013:002 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
        whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and didn't bear.
013:003 The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and said to her,
        See now, you are barren, and don't bear; but you shall conceive,
        and bear a son.
013:004 Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink,
        and don't eat any unclean thing:
013:005 for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
        shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite
        to God from the womb:  and he shall begin to save Israel
        out of the hand of the Philistines.
013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
        came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel
        of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him whence he was,
        neither did he tell me his name:
013:007 but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son;
        and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any
        unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God
        from the womb to the day of his death.
013:008 Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, Oh, Lord, please let
        the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach
        us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.
013:009 God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
        came again to the woman as she sat in the field:
        but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her.
013:010 The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said
        to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me
        the [other] day.
013:011 Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,
        and said to him, Are you the man who spoke to the woman?
        He said, I am.
013:012 Manoah said, Now let your words happen:  what shall be the ordering
        of the child, and [how] shall we do to him?
013:013 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said
        to the woman let her beware.
013:014 She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let
        her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing;
        all that I commanded her let her observe.
013:015 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you,
        that we may make ready a kid for you.
013:016 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me,
        I won't eat of your bread; and if you will make ready
        a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.
        For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of Yahweh.
013:017 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, What is your name,
        that when your words happen, we may honor you?
013:018 The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why do you ask after my name,
        seeing it is wonderful?
013:019 So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered
        it on the rock to Yahweh:  and [the angel] did wondrously,
        and Manoah and his wife looked on.
013:020 For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky
        from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in
        the flame of the altar:  and Manoah and his wife looked on;
        and they fell on their faces to the ground.
013:021 But the angel of Yahweh did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife.
        Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh.
013:022 Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we
        have seen God.
013:023 But his wife said to him, If Yahweh were pleased to kill us,
        he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering
        at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things,
        nor would at this time have told such things as these.
013:024 The woman bore a son, and named him Samson:  and the child grew,
        and Yahweh blessed him.
013:025 The Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan,
        between Zorah and Eshtaol.
014:001 Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of
        the daughters of the Philistines.
014:002 He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
        I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines:
        now therefore get her for me as wife.
014:003 Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there
        never a woman among the daughters of your brothers,
        or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of
        the uncircumcised Philistines?  Samson said to his father,
        Get her for me; for she pleases me well.
014:004 But his father and his mother didn't know that it was of Yahweh;
        for he sought an occasion against the Philistines.
        Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother,
        to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah:  and behold,
        a young lion roared against him.
014:006 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him
        as he would have torn a kid; and he had nothing in his hand:
        but he didn't tell his father or his mother what he had done.
014:007 He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
014:008 After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside
        to see the carcass of the lion:  and behold, there was a swarm
        of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
014:009 He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went;
        and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them,
        and they ate:  but he didn't tell them that he had taken
        the honey out of the body of the lion.
014:010 His father went down to the woman:  and Samson made there a feast;
        for so used the young men to do.
014:011 It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
        companions to be with him.
014:012 Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you:
        if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast,
        and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments
        and thirty changes of clothing;
014:013 but if you can't declare it to me, then shall you give me
        thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.
        They said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.
014:014 He said to them, Out of the eater came forth food.
        Out of the strong came forth sweetness.  They couldn't
        in three days declare the riddle.
014:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife,
        Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle,
        lest we burn you and your father's house with fire:
        have you called us to impoverish us? is it not [so]?
014:016 Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me,
        and don't love me:  you have put forth a riddle
        to the children of my people, and haven't told it me.
        He said to her, Behold, I haven't told it my father nor my mother,
        and shall I tell you?
014:017 She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:
        and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her,
        because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle
        to the children of her people.
014:018 The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun
        went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than
        a lion?  He said to them, If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,
        you wouldn't have found out my riddle.
014:019 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down
        to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
        and gave the changes [of clothing] to those who declared the riddle.
        His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
014:020 But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had
        used as his friend.
015:001 But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest,
        that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
        I will go in to my wife into the chamber.  But her father
        wouldn't allow him to go in.
015:002 Her father said, I most certainly thought that you had
        utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion:
        isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she?
        Please take her, instead.
015:003 Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard
        of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
015:004 Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
        and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst
        between every two tails.
015:005 When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
        the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both
        the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who has done this?  They said, Samson,
        the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife,
        and given her to his companion.  The Philistines came up,
        and burnt her and her father with fire.
015:007 Samson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I
        will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
015:008 He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter:
        and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread
        themselves in Lehi.
015:010 The men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us?
        They said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him
        as he has done to us.
015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock
        of Etam, and said to Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines
        are rulers over us?  What then is this that you have done to us?"
        He said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
015:012 They said to him, We have come down to bind you, that we
        may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.
        Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall
        on me yourselves.
015:013 They spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast,
        and deliver you into their hand:  but surely we will not kill you.
        They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up
        from the rock.
015:014 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him:
        and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and the ropes
        that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire,
        and his bands dropped from off his hands.
015:015 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand,
        and took it, and struck a thousand men therewith.
015:016 Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps,
        With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.
015:017 It happened, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast
        away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was
        called Ramath Lehi.
015:018 He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, You have
        given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant;
        and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand
        of the uncircumcised.
015:019 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out
        of it.  When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived:
        therefore the name of it was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi,
        to this day.
015:020 He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
016:001 Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went
        in to her.
016:002 [It was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here.
        They compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate
        of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, [Let be]
        until morning light, then we will kill him.
016:003 Samson lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid
        hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts,
        and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders,
        and carried them up to the top of the mountain that
        is before Hebron.
016:004 It came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley
        of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
016:005 The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her,
        Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies,
        and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind
        him to afflict him:  and we will each give you of us eleven
        hundred [pieces] of silver.
016:006 Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, Please, in which your great
        strength lies, and with which you might be bound to afflict you.
016:007 Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green cords
        that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be
        as another man.
016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
        cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
016:009 Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner chamber.
        She said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!"  He broke
        the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire.
        So his strength was not known.
016:010 Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies:
        now tell me, Please, with which you might be bound.
016:011 He said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes with
        which no work has been done, then shall I become weak,
        and be as another man.
016:012 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith,
        and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson.
        The ambush was waiting in the inner chamber.  He broke them
        off his arms like a thread.
016:013 Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me,
        and told me lies:  tell me with which you might be bound.
        He said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head
        with the web.
016:014 She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines
        are on you, Samson.  He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked
        away the pin of the beam, and the web.
016:015 She said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart
        is not with me? you have mocked me these three times,
        and have not told me in which your great strength lies.
016:016 It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words,
        and urged him, that his soul was vexed to death.
016:017 He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever
        come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my
        mother's womb.  If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me,
        and I will become weak, and be like any other man."
016:018 When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart,
        she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying,
        Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.
        Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought
        the money in their hand.
016:019 She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man,
        and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began
        to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
016:020 She said, The Philistines are on you, Samson.  He awoke out
        of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times,
        and shake myself free.  But he didn't know that Yahweh had
        departed from him.
016:021 The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they
        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
        and he ground at the mill in the prison.
016:022 However the hair of his head began to grow again after
        he was shaved.
016:023 The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer
        a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice;
        for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy
        into our hand.
016:024 When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said,
        Our god has delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer
        of our country, who has slain many of us.
016:025 It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
        Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.  They called
        for Samson out of the prison; and he made sport before them.
        They set him between the pillars:
016:026 and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, Allow me
        that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house rests,
        that I may lean on them.
016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
        of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about
        three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson made sport.
016:028 Samson called to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, remember me,
        Please, and strengthen me, Please, only this once, God, that I
        may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
016:029 Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the
        house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand,
        and the other with his left.
016:030 Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.
        He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell
        on the lords, and on all the people who were therein.
        So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those
        who he killed in his life.
016:031 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down,
        and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between
        Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father.
        He judged Israel twenty years.
017:001 There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
017:002 He said to his mother, The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver
        that were taken from you, about which you did utter a curse,
        and did also speak it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me;
        I took it.  His mother said, Blessed be my son of Yahweh.
017:003 He restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother;
        and his mother said, I most certainly dedicate the silver
        to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image
        and a molten image:  now therefore I will restore it to you.
017:004 When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took
        two hundred [pieces] of silver, and gave them to the founder,
        who made of it an engraved image and a molten image:
        and it was in the house of Micah.
017:005 The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,
        and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.
017:007 There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family
        of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
017:008 The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah,
        to sojourn where he could find [a place], and he came
        to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah,
        as he traveled.
017:009 Micah said to him, Whence come you?  He said to him, I am
        a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I go to sojourn where I
        may find [a place].
017:010 Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father
        and a priest, and I will give you ten [pieces] of silver
        by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your food.
        So the Levite went in.
017:011 The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
        man was to him as one of his sons.
017:012 Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest,
        and was in the house of Micah.
017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that Yahweh will do me good,
        seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel:  and in those days
        the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in;
        for to that day [their] inheritance had not fallen to them
        among the tribes of Israel.
018:002 The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
        whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,
        to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them,
        Go, search the land.  They came to the hill country of Ephraim,
        to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice
        of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there,
        and said to him, Who brought you here? and what do you in this
        place? and what have you here?
018:004 He said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me,
        and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.
018:005 They said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we
        may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
018:006 The priest said to them, Go in peace:  before Yahweh is your
        way wherein you go.
018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw
        the people who were therein, how they lived in security,
        after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure;
        for there was none in the land, possessing authority,
        that might put [them] to shame in anything, and they were far
        from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
018:008 They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol:
        and their brothers said to them, What [say] you?
018:009 They said, Arise, and let us go up against them;
        for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good:
        and are you still? don't be slothful to go and to enter
        in to possess the land.
018:010 When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land
        is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place
        where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.
018:011 There set forth from there of the family of the Danites,
        out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with
        weapons of war.
018:012 They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah:
        therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day;
        behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.
018:013 They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came
        to the house of Micah.
018:014 Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered,
        and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in
        these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image,
        and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.
018:015 They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young
        man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him
        of his welfare.
018:016 The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were
        of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
018:017 The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came
        in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod,
        and the teraphim, and the molten image:  and the priest stood
        by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt
        with weapons of war.
018:018 When these went into Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image,
        the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest
        said to them, What do you?
018:019 They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth,
        and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
        is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man,
        or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
018:020 The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim,
        and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.
018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and
        the livestock and the goods before them.
018:022 When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who
        were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together,
        and overtook the children of Dan.
018:023 They cried to the children of Dan.  They turned their faces,
        and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with
        such a company?
018:024 He said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest,
        and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say
        you to me, What ails you?
018:025 The children of Dan said to him, "Don't let your voice be heard
        among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life,
        with the lives of your household."
018:026 The children of Dan went their way:  and when Micah saw
        that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
        to his house.
018:027 They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom
        he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure,
        and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt
        the city with fire.
018:028 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon,
        and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in
        the valley that lies by Beth Rehob.  They built the city,
        and lived therein.
018:029 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
        their father, who was born to Israel:  however the name
        of the city was Laish at the first.
018:030 The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image:
        and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his
        sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day
        of the captivity of the land.
018:031 So they set them up Micah's engraved image which he made,
        all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
019:001 It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
        that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side
        of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine
        out of Bethlehem Judah.
019:002 His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went
        away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem Judah,
        and was there the space of four months.
019:003 Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her,
        to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple
        of donkeys:  and she brought him into her father's house;
        and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced
        to meet him.
019:004 His father-in-law, the young lady's father, retained him;
        and he abode with him three days:  so they ate and drink,
        and lodged there.
019:005 It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning,
        and he rose up to depart:  and the young lady's father said
        to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread,
        and afterward you shall go your way.
019:006 So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together:
        and the young lady's father said to the man, Please be pleased
        to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.
019:007 The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him,
        and he lodged there again.
019:008 He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
        and the young lady's father said, Please strengthen your heart
        and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.
019:009 When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine,
        and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady's father,
        said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening,
        please stay all night:  behold, the day grows to an end,
        lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get
        you early on your way, that you may go home.
019:010 But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed,
        and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem):
        and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled;
        his concubine also was with him.
019:011 When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant
        said to his master, Please come and let us turn aside into
        this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
019:012 His master said to him, We won't turn aside into the city
        of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel;
        but we will pass over to Gibeah.
019:013 He said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one
        of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
019:014 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
        on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
019:015 They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah:
        and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city;
        for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.
019:016 Behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even:
        now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned
        in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
019:017 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street
        of the city; and the old man said, Where go you? and
        whence come you?
019:018 He said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther
        side of the hill country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went
        to Bethlehem Judah:  and I am [now] going to the house of Yahweh;
        and there is no man who takes me into his house.
019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys;
        and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid,
        and for the young man who is with your servants:
        there is no want of anything.
019:020 The old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants
        lie on me; only don't lodge in the street.
019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder;
        and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.
019:022 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
        the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about,
        beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house,
        the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house,
        that we may know him.
019:023 The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said
        to them, No, my brothers, please don't act so wickedly;
        seeing that this man is come into my house, don't do this folly.
019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine;
        them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do
        with them what seems good to you:  but to this man don't
        do any such folly.
019:025 But the men wouldn't listen to him:  so the man laid hold
        on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they
        knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning:
        and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell
        down at the door of the man's house where her lord was,
        until it was light.
019:027 Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
        the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman
        his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house,
        with her hands on the threshold.
019:028 He said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered:
        then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up,
        and got him to his place.
019:029 When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on
        his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces,
        and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
019:030 It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed
        done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came
        up out of the land of Egypt to this day:  consider it,
        take counsel, and speak.
020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
        was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.
020:002 The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,
        presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,
        four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.
020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
        had gone up to Mizpah.)  The children of Israel said, Tell us,
        how was this wickedness brought to pass?
020:004 The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered,
        answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and
        my concubine, to lodge.
020:005 The men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
        round about me by night; me they thought to have slain,
        and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.
020:006 I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
        throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel;
        for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
020:007 Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your
        advice and counsel.
020:008 All the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us
        go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.
020:009 But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah:
        [we will go up] against it by lot;
020:010 and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all
        the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand,
        and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people,
        that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,
        according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.
020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city,
        knit together as one man.
020:012 The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
        saying, What wickedness is this that is happen among you?
020:013 Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah,
        that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.
        But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers
        the children of Israel.
020:014 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
        out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against
        the children of Israel.
020:015 The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out
        of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword,
        besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven
        hundred chosen men.
020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen
        men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth,
        and not miss.
020:017 The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred
        thousand men who drew sword:  all these were men of war.
020:018 The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked
        counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first
        to battle against the children of Benjamin?  Yahweh said,
        Judah [shall go up] first.
020:019 The children of Israel rose up in the morning,
        and encamped against Gibeah.
020:020 The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin;
        and the men of Israel set the battle in array against
        them at Gibeah.
020:021 The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah,
        and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day
        Twenty-two thousand men.
020:022 The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves,
        and set the battle again in array in the place where they
        set themselves in array the first day.
020:023 The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until even;
        and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near
        to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?
        Yahweh said, Go up against him.
020:024 The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin
        the second day.
020:025 Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day,
        and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel
        again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
        and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh,
        and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt
        offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
020:027 The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant
        of God was there in those days,
020:028 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before
        it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle
        against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?
        Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him
        into your hand.
020:029 Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.
020:030 The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin
        on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah,
        as at other times.
020:031 The children of Benjamin went out against the people,
        and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike
        and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways,
        of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah,
        in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
020:032 The children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us,
        as at the first.  But the children of Israel said, Let us flee,
        and draw them away from the city to the highways.
020:033 All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set
        themselves in array at Baal Tamar:  and the ambushers of Israel
        broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.
020:034 There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out
        of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they didn't know
        that evil was close on them.
020:035 Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel
        destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men:
        all these drew the sword.
020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck;
        for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they
        trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
020:037 The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers
        drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge
        of the sword.
020:038 Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers
        was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up
        out of the city.
020:039 The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began
        to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons;
        for they said, Surely they are struck down before us,
        as in the first battle.
020:040 But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar
        of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold,
        the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.
020:041 The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed;
        for they saw that evil had come on them.
020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
        to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard
        after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed
        them in the midst of it.
020:043 They enclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them,
        [and] trod them down at [their] resting place, as far as over
        against Gibeah toward the sunrise.
020:044 There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were]
        men of valor.
020:045 They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon:
        and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men,
        and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them
        two thousand men.
020:046 So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five
        thousand men who drew the sword; all these [were] men of valor.
020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to
        the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
020:048 The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin,
        and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the
        entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found:
        moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall
        not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife.
021:002 The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God,
        and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.
021:003 They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel,
        that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?
021:004 It happened on the next day that the people rose early,
        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings.
021:005 The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes
        of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh?  For they
        had made a great oath concerning him who didn't come up
        to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
021:006 The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother,
        and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
021:007 How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we
        have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our
        daughters to wives?
021:008 They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't
        come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?  Behold, there came none
        to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.
021:009 For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none
        of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.
021:010 The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant,
        and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants
        of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women
        and the little ones.
021:011 This is the thing that you shall do:  you shall utterly destroy
        every male, and every woman who has lain by man.
021:012 They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred
        young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him;
        and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in
        the land of Canaan.
021:013 The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin
        who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
021:014 Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women
        whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead:
        and yet so they weren't enough for them.
021:015 The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made
        a breach in the tribes of Israel.
021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
        wives for those who remain, seeing the women are destroyed
        out of Benjamin?
021:017 They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped
        of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.
021:018 However we may not give them wives of our daughters,
        for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be
        he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
021:019 They said, Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year
        in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east
        side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem,
        and on the south of Lebonah.
021:020 They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie
        in wait in the vineyards,
021:021 and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out
        to dance in the dances, then come you out of the vineyards,
        and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh,
        and go to the land of Benjamin.
021:022 It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain
        to us, that we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us,
        because we didn't take for each man his wife in battle,
        neither did you give them to them, else would you now be guilty.
021:023 The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to
        their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off:
        and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built
        the cities, and lived in them.
021:024 The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man
        to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there
        every man to his inheritance.
021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.
Book 08 Ruth
001:001 It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there
        was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah
        went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife,
        and his two sons.
001:002 The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi,
        and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
        Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab,
        and continued there.
001:003 Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left,
        and her two sons.
001:004 They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name
        of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth:
        and they lived there about ten years.
001:005 Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left
        of her two children and of her husband.
001:006 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
        from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab
        how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.
001:007 She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two
        daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return
        to the land of Judah.
001:008 Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each
        of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you,
        as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
001:009 Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house
        of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept.
001:010 They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.
001:011 Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me?
        have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have
        a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even
        have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;
001:013 would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you
        therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters,
        for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh
        is gone forth against me.
001:014 They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed
        her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.
001:015 She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people,
        and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.
001:016 Ruth said, "Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return
        from following after you, for where you go, I will go;
        and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people,
        and your God my God;
001:017 where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried:
        Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part
        you and me."
001:018 When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her,
        she left off speaking to her.
001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened,
        when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved
        about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?
001:020 She said to them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara;
        for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
001:021 I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty;
        why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me,
        and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,
        with her, who returned out of the country of Moab:
        and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
002:001 Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
        of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
002:002 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field,
        and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight
        I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.
002:003 She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
        and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging
        to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
002:004 Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers,
        Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.
002:005 Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers,
        Whose young lady is this?
002:006 The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite
        lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
002:007 She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers
        among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even
        from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little
        in the house.
002:008 Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter?
        Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence,
        but abide here fast by my maidens.
002:009 Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them:
        haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch
        you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink
        of that which the young men have drawn.
002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight,
        that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
002:011 Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you
        have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband;
        and how you have left your father and your mother,
        and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you
        didn't know before.
002:012 Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come
        to take refuge.
002:013 Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord,
        because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly
        to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.
002:014 At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread,
        and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers,
        and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed,
        and left of it.
002:015 When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his
        young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves,
        and don't reproach her.
002:016 Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it,
        and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.
002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that
        which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
002:018 She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law
        saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave
        to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
002:019 Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and
        where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you.
        She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said,
        The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
002:020 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh,
        who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.
        Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us,
        one of our near kinsmen.
002:021 Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep
        fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
002:022 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter,
        that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you
        in any other field.
002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived
        with her mother-in-law.
003:001 Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I
        not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
003:002 Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were?
        Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.
003:003 Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing
        on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't
        make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done
        eating and drinking.
003:004 It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place
        where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet,
        and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
003:005 She said to her, All that you say I will do.
003:006 She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all
        that her mother-in-law told her.
003:007 When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,
        he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain:
        and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
003:008 It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself;
        and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
003:009 He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid:
        spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are
        a near kinsman.
003:010 He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter:
        you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at
        the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men,
        whether poor or rich.
003:011 Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that
        you say; for all the city of my people does know that you
        are a worthy woman.
003:012 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is
        a kinsman nearer than I.
003:013 Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
        perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the
        kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you,
        then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives:
        lie down until the morning.
003:014 She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before
        one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known
        that the woman came to the threshing floor.
003:015 He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it;
        and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley,
        and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.
003:016 When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you,
        my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.
003:017 She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said,
        "Don't go empty to your mother-in-law."
003:018 Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how
        the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has
        finished the thing this day."
004:001 Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there:
        and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by;
        to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.
        He turned aside, and sat down.
004:002 He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you
        down here.  They sat down.
004:003 He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out
        of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land,
        which was our brother Elimelech's:
004:004 I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before
        those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.
        If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not
        redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there
        is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.
        He said, I will redeem it.
004:005 Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi,
        you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead,
        to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.
004:006 The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you;
        for I can't redeem it.
004:007 Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things:
        a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor;
        and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.
004:008 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself.
        He drew off his shoe.
004:009 Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses
        this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's,
        and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead
        on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off
        from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place:
        you are witnesses this day.
004:011 All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We
        are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house
        like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel:
        and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
004:012 and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar
        bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you
        of this young woman.
004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her,
        and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.
004:014 The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left
        you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be
        famous in Israel.
004:015 He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you
        in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you,
        who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.
004:016 Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse to it.
004:017 The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son
        born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father
        of Jesse, the father of David.
004:018 Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became
        the father of Hezron,
004:019 and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became
        the father of Amminadab,
004:020 and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became
        the father of Salmon,
004:021 and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became
        the father of Obed,
004:022 and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became
        the father of David.
Book 09 1 Samuel
001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim,
        of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah,
        the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu,
        the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
001:002 and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah,
        and the name of other Peninnah:  and Peninnah had children,
        but Hannah had no children.
001:003 This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship
        and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh.  The two sons
        of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.
001:004 When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah
        his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
001:005 but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah,
        but Yahweh had shut up her womb.
001:006 Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh
        had shut up her womb.
001:007 [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
        of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept,
        and did not eat.
001:008 Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why
        don't you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better
        to you than ten sons?
001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
        they had drunk.  Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat
        by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.
001:010 She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh,
        and wept sore.
001:011 She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed
        look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me,
        and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid
        a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life,
        and there shall no razor come on his head.
001:012 It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli
        marked her mouth.
001:013 Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved,
        but her voice was not heard:  therefore Eli thought she
        had been drunken.
001:014 Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your
        wine from you.
001:015 Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit:
        I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured
        out my soul before Yahweh.
001:016 Don't count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out
        of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have
        I spoken hitherto.
001:017 Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant
        your petition that you have asked of him.
001:018 She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.
        So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression
        wasn't sad any more.
001:019 They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh,
        and returned, and came to their house to Ramah:
        and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.
001:020 It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived,
        and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I
        have asked him of Yahweh.
001:021 The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh
        the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
001:022 But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not
        go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him,
        that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.
001:023 Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good;
        wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word.
        So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.
001:024 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her,
        with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle
        of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh:
        and the child was young.
001:025 They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.
001:026 She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am
        the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.
001:027 For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition
        which I asked of him:
001:028 therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives
        he is granted to Yahweh.  He worshiped Yahweh there.
002:001 Hannah prayed, and said:  My heart exults in Yahweh!  My horn
        is exalted in Yahweh.  My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,
        because I rejoice in your salvation.
002:002 There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you,
        nor is there any rock like our God.
002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly.  Don't let arrogance
        come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.
        By him actions are weighed.
002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken.  Those who stumbled
        are girded with strength.
002:005 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.
        Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]. Yes, the barren
        has borne seven.  She who has many children languishes.
002:006 Yahweh kills, and makes alive.  He brings down to Sheol,
        and brings up.
002:007 Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.  He brings low,
        he also lifts up.
002:008 He raises up the poor out of the dust.  He lifts up the needy
        from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit
        the throne of glory, for the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's.
        He has set the world on them.
002:009 He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put
        to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.
002:010 Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.
        He will thunder against them in the sky.  Yahweh will judge
        the ends of the earth.  He will give strength to his king,
        and exalt the horn of his anointed.
002:011 Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.  The child did minister
        to Yahweh before Eli the priest.
002:012 Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.
002:013 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man
        offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh
        was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
002:014 and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
        all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith.
        So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
002:015 Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said
        to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;
        for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.
002:016 If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first,
        and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say,
        No, but you shall give it me now:  and if not, I will take
        it by force.
002:017 The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh;
        for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.
002:018 But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child,
        girded with a linen ephod.
002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it
        to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband
        to offer the yearly sacrifice.
002:020 Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed
        of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.
        They went to their own home.
002:021 Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons
        and two daughters.  The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.
002:022 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did
        to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served
        at the door of the tent of meeting.
002:023 He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your
        evil dealings from all this people.
002:024 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear:
        you make Yahweh's people to disobey.
002:025 If one man sin against another, God shall judge him;
        but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?
        Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father,
        because Yahweh was minded to kill them.
002:026 The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh,
        and also with men.
002:027 There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says
        Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father,
        when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?
002:028 and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be
        my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear
        an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father
        all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
002:029 Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have
        commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me,
        to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings
        of Israel my people?
002:030 Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed
        that your house, and the house of your father, should walk
        before me forever:  but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me;
        for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise
        me shall be lightly esteemed.
002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm
        of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man
        in your house.
002:032 You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth
        which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old
        man in your house forever.
002:033 The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar,
        [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart;
        and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower
        of their age.
002:034 This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons,
        on Hophni and Phinehas:  in one day they shall die both of them.
002:035 I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
        according to that which is in my heart and in my mind:
        and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before
        my anointed forever.
002:036 It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall
        come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf
        of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests'
        offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
003:001 The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli.
        The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was
        no frequent vision.
003:002 It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place
        (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),
003:003 and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had laid
        down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark
        of God was;
003:004 that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.
003:005 He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.
        He said, I didn't call; lie down again.  He went and lay down.
003:006 Yahweh called yet again, Samuel.  Samuel arose and went to Eli,
        and said, Here am I; for you called me.  He answered,
        I didn't call, my son; lie down again.
003:007 Now Samuel didn't yet know Yahweh, neither was the word
        of Yahweh yet revealed to him.
003:008 Yahweh called Samuel again the third time.  He arose
        and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.
        Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.
003:009 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down:  and it shall be,
        if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your
        servant hears.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
003:010 Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.
        Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.
003:011 Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
        at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken
        concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever,
        for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring
        a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them.
003:014 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity
        of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice
        nor offering forever.
003:015 Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house
        of Yahweh.  Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.
        He said, Here am I.
003:017 He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you?
        Please don't hide it from me.  God do so to you, and more also,
        if you hide anything from me of all the things that he
        spoke to you."
003:018 Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.
        He said, It is Yahweh:  let him do what seems him good.
003:019 Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his
        words fall to the ground.
003:020 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
        established to be a prophet of Yahweh.
003:021 Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself
        to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.
004:001 The word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out
        against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer:
        and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
004:002 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
        and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before
        the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field
        about four thousand men.
004:003 When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said,
        Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines?  Let us
        get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us,
        that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand
        of our enemies.
004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits [above] the cherubim:
        and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there
        with the ark of the covenant of God.
004:005 When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp,
        all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
004:006 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
        What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of
        the Hebrews?  They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come
        into the camp.
004:007 The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
        into the camp.  They said, Woe to us! for there has not been
        such a thing heretofore.
004:008 Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
        gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all
        manner of plagues in the wilderness.
004:009 Be strong, and behave yourselves like men, O you Philistines,
        that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
        quit yourselves like men, and fight.
004:010 The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled
        every man to his tent:  and there was a very great slaughter;
        for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
004:011 The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
        and Phinehas, were slain.
004:012 There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh
        the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.
004:013 When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the
        road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God.
        When the man came into the city, and told it, all the
        city cried out.
004:014 When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means
        the noise of this tumult?  The man hurried, and came
        and told Eli.
004:015 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set,
        so that he could not see.
004:016 The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled
        today out of the army.  He said, How went the matter, my son?
004:017 He who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before
        the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter
        among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas,
        are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
004:018 It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli]
        fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate;
        and his neck broke, and he died:  for he was an old man, and heavy.
        He had judged Israel forty years.
004:019 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,
        near to be delivered:  and when she heard the news that
        the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her
        husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth;
        for her pains came on her.
004:020 About the time of her death the women who stood by her said
        to her, Don't be afraid; for you have brought forth a son.
        But she didn't answer, neither did she regard it.
004:021 She named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
        from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because
        of her father-in-law and her husband.
004:022 She said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark
        of God is taken.
005:001 Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought
        it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
005:002 The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into
        the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
005:003 When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was
        fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh.
        They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
005:004 When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was
        fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh;
        and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay]
        cut off on the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was
        left to him.
005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into
        Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,
        to this day.
005:006 But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod,
        and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod
        and the borders of it.
005:007 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said,
        The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us;
        for his hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.
005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
        to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God
        of Israel?  They answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel
        be carried about to Gath.  They carried the ark of the God
        of Israel [there].
005:009 It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand
        of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion:
        and he struck the men of the city, both small and great;
        and tumors broke out on them.
005:010 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  It happened, as the ark
        of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
        They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us,
        to kill us and our people.
005:011 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of
        the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God
        of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it
        not kill us and our people.  For there was a deadly confusion
        throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
005:012 The men who didn't die were struck with the tumors;
        and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
006:001 The ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
006:002 The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
        saying, "What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh?  Show us
        with which we shall send it to its place."
006:003 They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don't send
        it empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering:
        then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why
        his hand is not removed from you."
006:004 Then they said, "What shall be the trespass offering which we
        shall return to him?"  They said, "Five golden tumors,
        and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords
        of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all,
        and on your lords.
006:005 Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your
        mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God
        of Israel:  peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you,
        and from off your gods, and from off your land.
006:006 Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh
        hardened their hearts?  When he had worked wonderfully among them,
        didn't they let the people go, and they departed?
006:007 Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart,
        and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie
        the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
006:008 and take the ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put
        the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering,
        in a coffer by the side of it; and send it away, that it may go.
006:009 Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to
        Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil:  but if not,
        then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us;
        it was a chance that happened to us."
006:010 The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart,
        and shut up their calves at home;
006:011 and they put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer
        with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
006:012 The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh;
        they went along the highway, lowing as they went,
        and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left;
        and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border
        of Beth Shemesh.
006:013 They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley;
        and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced
        to see it.
006:014 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh,
        and stood there, where there was a great stone:
        and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows
        for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
006:015 The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that
        was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them
        on the great stone:  and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt
        offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.
006:016 When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned
        to Ekron the same day.
006:017 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for
        a trespass offering to Yahweh:  for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,
        for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
006:018 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
        of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified
        cities and of country villages, even to the great stone,
        whereon they set down the ark of Yahweh, [which stone remains]
        to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
006:019 He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked
        into the ark of Yahweh, he struck of the people fifty thousand
        seventy men; and the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck
        the people with a great slaughter.
006:020 The men of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Yahweh,
        this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
006:021 They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim,
        saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Yahweh;
        come you down, and bring it up to you.
007:001 The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Yahweh,
        and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,
        and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Yahweh.
007:002 It happened, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath Jearim,
        that the time was long; for it was twenty years:
        and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
007:003 Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you
        do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away
        the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you,
        and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only;
        and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth,
        and served Yahweh only.
007:005 Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray
        for you to Yahweh."
007:006 They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured
        it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there,
        "We have sinned against Yahweh."  Samuel judged the children
        of Israel in Mizpah.
007:007 When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
        gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went
        up against Israel.  When the children of Israel heard it,
        they were afraid of the Philistines.
007:008 The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Don't cease to cry
        to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand
        of the Philistines."
007:009 Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt
        offering to Yahweh:  and Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel;
        and Yahweh answered him.
007:010 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
        drew near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a
        great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them;
        and they were struck down before Israel.
007:011 The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines,
        and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.
007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen,
        and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto has
        Yahweh helped us.
007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within
        the border of Israel:  and the hand of Yahweh was against
        the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
007:014 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
        restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the border
        of it did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines.
        There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
007:015 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
007:016 He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal,
        and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
007:017 His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there
        he judged Israel:  and he built there an altar to Yahweh.
008:001 It happened, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
        judges over Israel.
008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of
        his second, Abijah:  they were judges in Beersheba.
008:003 His sons didn't walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
        and took bribes, and perverted justice.
008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
        and came to Samuel to Ramah;
008:005 and they said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons
        don't walk in your ways:  now make us a king to judge us
        like all the nations.
008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king
        to judge us.  Samuel prayed to Yahweh.
008:007 Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people
        in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you,
        but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.
008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
        that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day,
        in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods,
        so do they also to you.
008:009 Now therefore listen to their voice:  however you shall protest
        solemnly to them, and shall show them the manner of the king
        who shall reign over them.
008:010 Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked
        of him a king.
008:011 He said, This will be the manner of the king who shall reign
        over you:  he will take your sons, and appoint them to him,
        for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run
        before his chariots;
008:012 and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands,
        and captains of fifties; and [he will set some] to plow his ground,
        and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war,
        and the instruments of his chariots.
008:013 He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks,
        and to be bakers.
008:014 He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves,
        even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
008:015 He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
        and give to his officers, and to his servants.
008:016 He will take your male servants, and your female servants,
        and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them
        to his work.
008:017 He will take the tenth of your flocks:  and you shall
        be his servants.
008:018 You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall
        have chosen you; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.
008:019 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel;
        and they said, No:  but we will have a king over us,
008:020 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king
        may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
008:021 Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
        them in the ears of Yahweh.
008:022 Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king.
        Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go you every man to his city.
009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
        of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son
        of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
009:002 He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man;
        and there was not among the children of Israel a better
        person than he.  From his shoulders and upward he was higher
        than any of the people.
009:003 The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost.  Kish said
        to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you,
        and arise, go seek the donkeys.
009:004 He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed
        through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them:
        then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they
        weren't there:  and he passed through the land of the Benjamites,
        but they didn't find them.
009:005 When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
        who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father
        leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.
009:006 He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God,
        and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes
        surely to pass:  now let us go there; peradventure he can
        tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
        we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
        and there is not a present to bring to the man of God:
        what have we?
009:008 The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
        in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver:
        that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
009:009 (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God,
        thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is
        now called a Prophet was before called a Seer.)
009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.
        So they went to the city where the man of God was.
009:011 As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens
        going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
009:012 They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you:
        make haste now, for he is come today into the city;
        for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:
009:013 as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately
        find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat;
        for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless
        the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat who are invited.
        Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find him.
009:014 They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city,
        behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
009:015 Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
009:016 Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land
        of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my
        people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand
        of the Philistines:  for I have looked on my people,
        because their cry is come to me.
009:017 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man
        of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority
        over my people.
009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said,
        Tell me, Please, where the seer's house is.
009:019 Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before
        me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today:
        and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all
        that is in your heart.
009:020 As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago,
        don't set your mind on them; for they are found.
        For whom is all that is desirable in Israel?  Is it not for you,
        and for all your father's house?
009:021 Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest
        of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all
        the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you
        to me after this manner?
009:022 Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
        the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among
        those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.
009:023 Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you,
        of which I said to you, Set it by you.
009:024 The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it
        before Saul.  [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved!
        set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has
        it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people.
        So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
009:025 When they were come down from the high place into the city,
        he talked with Saul on the housetop.
009:026 They arose early:  and it happened about the spring of the day,
        that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I
        may send you away.  Saul arose, and they went out both of them,
        he and Samuel, abroad.
009:027 As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said
        to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on),
        but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear
        the word of God.
010:001 Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head,
        and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed
        you to be prince over his inheritance?
010:002 When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men
        by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they
        will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found;
        and behold, your father has left off caring for the donkeys,
        and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
010:003 Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall
        come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there
        three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids,
        and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying
        a bottle of wine:
010:004 and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread,
        which you shall receive of their hand.
010:005 After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is
        the garrison of the Philistines:  and it shall happen,
        when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a band
        of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery,
        and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
        and they will be prophesying:
010:006 and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall
        prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
010:007 Let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do
        as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.
010:008 You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come
        down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice
        sacrifices of peace offerings:  seven days shall you wait,
        until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.
010:009 It was so, that when he had turned his back to go
        from Samuel, God gave him another heart:  and all those signs
        happened that day.
010:010 When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets
        met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him,
        and he prophesied among them.
010:011 It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold,
        he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one
        to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish?  Is Saul
        also among the prophets?
010:012 One of the same place answered, Who is their father?
        Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
010:013 When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
010:014 Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you?
        He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they
        were not found, we came to Samuel.
010:015 Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.
010:016 Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys
        were found.  But concerning the matter of the kingdom,
        of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.
010:017 Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;
010:018 and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt,
        and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
        and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:
010:019 but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves
        you out of all your calamities and your distresses;
        and you have said to him, [No], but set a king over us.
        Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes,
        and by your thousands.
010:020 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe
        of Benjamin was taken.
010:021 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families;
        and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son
        of Kish was taken:  but when they sought him, he could
        not be found.
010:022 Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man
        to come here?  Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself
        among the baggage.
010:023 They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among
        the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
        shoulders and upward.
010:024 Samuel said to all the people, "You see him whom Yahweh
        has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?"
        All the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.
010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom,
        and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh.
        Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
010:026 Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him
        the army, whose hearts God had touched.
010:027 But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us?
        They despised him, and brought him no present.
        But he held his peace.
011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead:
        and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant
        with us, and we will serve you.
011:002 Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I
        make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out;
        and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.
011:003 The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we
        may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then,
        if there be none to save us, we will come out to you.
011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these
        words in the ears of the people:  and all the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept.
011:005 Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field;
        and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep?
        They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
011:006 The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words,
        and his anger was kindled greatly.
011:007 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent
        them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand
        of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn't come forth after
        Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.
        The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out
        as one man.
011:008 He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were
        three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
011:009 They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell
        the men of Jabesh Gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot,
        you shall have deliverance.  The messengers came and told
        the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you,
        and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.
011:011 It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in
        three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the
        morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day:
        and it happened, that those who remained were scattered,
        so that no two of them were left together.
011:012 The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign
        over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
011:013 Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day;
        for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.
011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
        and renew the kingdom there.
011:015 All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
        before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices
        of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all
        the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
012:001 Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice
        in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.
012:002 Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old
        and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you:
        and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.
012:003 Here I am:  witness against me before Yahweh, and before
        his anointed:  whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I
        taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed?
        or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes
        therewith? and I will restore it you.
012:004 They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
        neither have you taken anything of any man's hand.
012:005 He said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed
        is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.
        They said, He is witness.
012:006 Samuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron,
        and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you
        before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh,
        which he did to you and to your fathers.
012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh,
        then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your
        fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
012:009 But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand
        of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand
        of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab;
        and they fought against them.
012:010 They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have
        forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth:
        but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we
        will serve you.
012:011 Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,
        and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side;
        and you lived in safety.
012:012 When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came
        against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us;
        when Yahweh your God was your king.
012:013 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you
        have asked for:  and behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.
012:014 If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice,
        and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you
        and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh
        your God, [well]:
012:015 but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel
        against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh
        be against you, as it was against your fathers.
012:016 Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh
        will do before your eyes.
012:017 Isn't it wheat harvest today?  I will call to Yahweh,
        that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see
        that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight
        of Yahweh, in asking you a king.
012:018 So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain
        that day:  and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.
012:019 All the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Yahweh
        your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins
        [this] evil, to ask us a king.
012:020 Samuel said to the people, "Don't be afraid; you have indeed
        done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following Yahweh,
        but serve Yahweh with all your heart:
012:021 and don't turn aside; for [then would you go] after vain things
        which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
012:022 For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake,
        because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself.
012:023 Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against
        Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you:  but I will instruct you
        in the good and the right way.
012:024 Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart;
        for consider how great things he has done for you.
012:025 But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed,
        both you and your king."
013:001 Saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign;
        and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, of which two
        thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel,
        and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin:
        and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
013:003 Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba:
        and the Philistines heard of it.  Saul blew the trumpet
        throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
013:004 All Israel heard say that Saul had struck the garrison of
        the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination
        with the Philistines.  The people were gathered together
        after Saul to Gilgal.
013:005 The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel,
        thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
        and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude:
        and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.
013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait
        (for the people were distressed), then the people did
        hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks,
        and in coverts, and in pits.
013:007 Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land
        of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal,
        and all the people followed him trembling.
013:008 He stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
        [had appointed]: but Samuel didn't come to Gilgal;
        and the people were scattered from him.
013:009 Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the
        peace offerings.  He offered the burnt offering.
013:010 It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering
        the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out
        to meet him, that he might greet him.
013:011 Samuel said, What have you done?  Saul said, Because I saw
        that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't
        come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
        assembled themselves together at Michmash;
013:012 therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me
        to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of Yahweh:  I forced
        myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.
013:013 Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept
        the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you:
        for now would Yahweh have established your kingdom
        on Israel forever.
013:014 But now your kingdom shall not continue:  Yahweh has sought
        him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him
        to be prince over his people, because you have not kept
        that which Yahweh commanded you.
013:015 Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.
        Saul numbered the people who were present with him,
        about six hundred men.
013:016 Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present
        with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin:  but the Philistines
        encamped in Michmash.
013:017 The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
        three companies:  one company turned to the way that leads
        to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
013:018 and another company turned the way to Beth Horon;
        and another company turned the way of the border that looks
        down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel;
        for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
        swords or spears:
013:020 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
        every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;
013:021 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares,
        and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
        sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who
        were with Saul and Jonathan:  but with Saul and with Jonathan
        his son was there found.
013:023 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
014:001 Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said
        to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go
        over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side.
        But he didn't tell his father.
014:002 Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate
        tree which is in Migron:  and the people who were with him
        were about six hundred men;
014:003 and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas,
        the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.
        The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.
014:004 Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to
        the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side,
        and a rocky crag on the other side:  and the name of the one
        was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
014:005 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash,
        and the other on the south in front of Geba.
014:006 Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come,
        and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised:
        it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no
        restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.
014:007 His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart:
        turn you, behold, I am with you according to your heart.
014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men,
        and we will disclose ourselves to them.
014:009 If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we
        will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
014:010 But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up;
        for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand:  and this shall
        be the sign to us.
014:011 Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines:
        and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
        out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
014:012 The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer,
        and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.
        Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me;
        for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
014:013 Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his
        armor bearer after him:  and they fell before Jonathan;
        and his armor bearer killed them after him.
014:014 That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made,
        was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length
        in an acre of land.
014:015 There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all
        the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled;
        and the earth quaked:  so there was an exceeding great trembling.
014:016 The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold,
        the multitude melted away, and they went [here] and there.
014:017 Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now,
        and see who is gone from us.  When they had numbered, behold,
        Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
014:018 Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God.  For the ark
        of God was [there] at that time with the children of Israel.
014:019 It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult
        that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased:
        and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.
014:020 Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together,
        and came to the battle:  and behold, every man's sword was
        against his fellow, [and there was] a very great confusion.
014:021 Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before,
        and who went up with them into the camp, [from the country]
        round about, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites
        who were with Saul and Jonathan.
014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill
        country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled,
        even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
014:023 So Yahweh saved Israel that day:  and the battle passed over
        by Beth Aven.
014:024 The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had
        adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any
        food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies.
        So none of the people tasted food.
014:025 All the people came into the forest; and there was honey
        on the ground.
014:026 When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped:
        but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people
        feared the oath.
014:027 But Jonathan didn't hear when his father charged the people
        with the oath:  therefore he put forth the end of the rod
        who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put
        his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly
        charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
        who eats food this day.  The people were faint.
014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land.
        Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I
        tasted a little of this honey.
014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today
        of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has
        there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.
014:031 They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon.
        The people were very faint;
014:032 and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
        and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people
        ate them with the blood.
014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin
        against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood.
        He said, you have dealt treacherously:  roll a great stone
        to me this day.
014:034 Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them,
        Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
        and kill them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh
        in eating with the blood.  All the people brought every man
        his ox with him that night, and killed them there.
014:035 Saul built an altar to Yahweh:  the same was the first altar
        that he built to Yahweh.
014:036 Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
        and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not
        leave a man of them.  They said, Do whatever seems good to you.
        Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.
014:037 Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?
        will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?  But he didn't
        answer him that day.
014:038 Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people;
        and know and see in which this sin has been this day.
014:039 For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan
        my son, he shall surely die.  But there was not a man among
        all the people who answered him.
014:040 Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side,
        and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.
        The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.
014:041 Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right.
        Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.
014:042 Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son.
        Jonathan was taken.
014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done.
        Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little
        honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold,
        I must die.
014:044 Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall
        surely die, Jonathan.
014:045 The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has
        worked this great salvation in Israel?  Far from it:
        as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head
        fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day.
        So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn't die.
014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines;
        and the Philistines went to their own place.
014:047 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought
        against all his enemies on every side, against Moab,
        and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom,
        and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines:
        and wherever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.
014:048 He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered
        Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.
014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua;
        and the names of his two daughters were these:  the name
        of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
014:050 and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.
        The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son
        of Ner, Saul's uncle.
014:051 Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
        the son of Abiel.
014:052 There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
        and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man,
        he took him to him.
015:001 Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king
        over his people, over Israel:  now therefore listen you
        to the voice of the words of Yahweh.
015:002 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek
        did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way,
        when he came up out of Egypt.
015:003 Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
        and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman,
        infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.
015:004 Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim,
        two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
015:005 Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
015:006 Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among
        the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you shown kindness
        to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.
        So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
015:007 Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur,
        that is before Egypt.
015:008 He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
        destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
        and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all
        that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them:  but everything
        that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
015:010 Then came the word of Yahweh to Samuel, saying,
015:011 It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned
        back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.
        Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.
015:012 Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it
        was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold,
        he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on,
        and went down to Gilgal.
015:013 Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed are you
        by Yahweh:  I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.
015:014 Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears,
        and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
015:015 Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:
        for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,
        to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we
        have utterly destroyed.
015:016 Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh
        has said to me this night.  He said to him, Say on.
015:017 Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight,
        weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel?  Yahweh anointed
        you king over Israel;
015:018 and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly
        destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
        until they are consumed.'
015:019 Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil,
        and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"
015:020 Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh,
        and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag
        the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
        of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.
015:022 Samuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings
        and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?  Behold, to obey
        is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
        as idolatry and teraphim.  Because you have rejected the word
        of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.
015:024 Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed
        the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared
        the people, and obeyed their voice.
015:025 Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me,
        that I may worship Yahweh.
015:026 Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you
        have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected
        you from being king over Israel.
015:027 As Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt
        of his robe, and it tore.
015:028 Samuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel
        from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours
        who is better than you.
015:029 Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent;
        for he is not a man, that he should repent.
015:030 Then he said, I have sinned:  yet honor me now, Please, before the
        elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me,
        that I may worship Yahweh your God.
015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.
015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king
        of the Amalekites.  Agag came to him cheerfully.
        Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
015:033 Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall
        your mother be childless among women.  Samuel hewed Agag
        in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.
015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house
        to Gibeah of Saul.
015:035 Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death;
        for Samuel mourned for Saul:  and Yahweh grieved that he had
        made Saul king over Israel.
016:001 Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I
        have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill your horn
        with oil, and go:  I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite;
        for I have provided me a king among his sons.
016:002 Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
        Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come
        to sacrifice to Yahweh.
016:003 Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do:
        and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.
016:004 Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem.
        The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said,
        Come you peaceably?
016:005 He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh:
        sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.
        He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
016:006 It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab,
        and said, Surely Yahweh's anointed is before him.
016:007 But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don't look on his face, or on
        the height of his stature; because I have rejected him:
        for [Yahweh sees] not as man sees; for man looks at the
        outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."
016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
        He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.
016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  He said, Neither has
        Yahweh chosen this.
016:010 Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
        Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.
016:011 Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children?
        He said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is
        keeping the sheep.  Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him;
        for we will not sit down until he come here.
016:012 He sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy,
        and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on.
        Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
        of his brothers:  and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily
        on David from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up,
        and went to Ramah.
016:014 Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
        from Yahweh troubled him.
016:015 Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from
        God troubles you.
016:016 Let our lord now command your servants who are before you,
        to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp:
        and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you,
        that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.
016:017 Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well,
        and bring him to me.
016:018 Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen
        a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing,
        and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent
        in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.
016:019 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me
        David your son, who is with the sheep.
016:020 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine,
        and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
016:021 David came to Saul, and stood before him:  and he loved him greatly;
        and he became his armor bearer.
016:022 Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me;
        for he has found favor in my sight.
016:023 It happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul,
        that David took the harp, and played with his hand:
        so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit
        departed from him.
017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle;
        and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah,
        and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
017:002 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,
        and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
        against the Philistines.
017:003 The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side,
        and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side:
        and there was a valley between them.
017:004 There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
        named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
017:005 He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a
        coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand
        shekels of brass.
017:006 He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass
        between his shoulders.
017:007 The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam;
        and his spear's head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron:
        and his shield bearer went before him.
017:008 He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them,
        Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am I not
        a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you,
        and let him come down to me.
017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we
        be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
        then shall you be our servants, and serve us.
017:010 The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
        give me a man, that we may fight together.
017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
        they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah,
        whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons:  and the man was
        an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.
017:013 The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle:
        and the names of his three sons who went to the battle
        were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab,
        and the third Shammah.
017:014 David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
017:015 Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's
        sheep at Bethlehem.
017:016 The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
        himself forty days.
017:017 Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers
        an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves,
        and carry [them] quickly to the camp to your brothers;
017:018 and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand,
        and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.
017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley
        of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
017:020 David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
        a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
        and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was
        going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
017:021 Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array,
        army against army.
017:022 David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage,
        and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.
017:023 As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
        the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks
        of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words:
        and David heard them.
017:024 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
        and were sore afraid.
017:025 The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come
        up? surely to defy Israel is he come up:  and it shall be,
        that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him
        with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make
        his father's house free in Israel.
017:026 David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall
        be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away
        the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine,
        that he should defy the armies of the living God?
017:027 The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall
        it be done to the man who kills him.
017:028 Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's
        anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why are you come down?
        and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?
        I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart;
        for you have come down that you might see the battle.
017:029 David said, What have I now done?  Is there not a cause?
017:030 He turned away from him toward another, and spoke after
        the same manner:  and the people answered him again after
        the former manner.
017:031 When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed
        them before Saul; and he sent for him.
017:032 David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him;
        your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
017:033 Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this
        Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth,
        and he a man of war from his youth.
017:034 David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father's sheep;
        and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out
        of the flock,
017:035 I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out
        of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him
        by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.
017:036 Your servant struck both the lion and the bear:
        and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them,
        seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.
017:037 David said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion,
        and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand
        of this Philistine.  Saul said to David, Go, and Yahweh shall
        be with you.
017:038 Saul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass
        on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
017:039 David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go;
        for he had not proved it.  David said to Saul, I can't go with these;
        for I have not proved them.  David put them off him.
017:040 He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
        out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which
        he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand:
        and he drew near to the Philistine.
017:041 The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man
        who bore the shield went before him.
017:042 When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him;
        for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.
017:043 The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me
        with sticks?  The Philistine cursed David by his gods.
017:044 The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
        your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals
        of the field.
017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword,
        and with a spear, and with a javelin:  but I come to you in
        the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel,
        whom you have defied.
017:046 This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will
        strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give
        the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day
        to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth;
        that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
017:047 and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't
        save with sword and spear:  for the battle is Yahweh's,
        and he will give you into our hand.
017:048 It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near
        to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army
        to meet the Philistine.
017:049 David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone,
        and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead;
        and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face
        to the earth.
017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and
        with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him;
        but there was no sword in the hand of David.
017:051 Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword,
        and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him,
        and cut off his head therewith.  When the Philistines saw
        that their champion was dead, they fled.
017:052 The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued
        the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron.
        The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,
        even to Gath, and to Ekron.
017:053 The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines,
        and they plundered their camp.
017:054 David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem;
        but he put his armor in his tent.
017:055 When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner,
        the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth?
        Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell.
017:056 The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"
017:057 As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
        took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
        the Philistine in his hand.
017:058 Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man?
        David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
018:001 It happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul,
        that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
        and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
018:002 Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
        to his father's house.
018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
        as his own soul.
018:004 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him,
        and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword,
        and to his bow, and to his sash.
018:005 David went out wherever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely:
        and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight
        of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
018:006 It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter
        of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities
        of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
        with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.
018:007 The women sang one to another as they played, and said,
        Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands.
018:008 Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him;
        and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands,
        and to me they have ascribed but thousands:  and what can
        he have more but the kingdom?
018:009 Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
018:010 It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came
        mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house:
        and David played with his hand, as he did day by day.
        Saul had his spear in his hand;
018:011 and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David
        even to the wall.  David avoided out of his presence twice.
018:012 Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him,
        and was departed from Saul.
018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
        over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
018:014 David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh
        was with him.
018:015 When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood
        in awe of him.
018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came
        in before them.
018:017 Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give
        you as wife:  only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh's battles.
        For Saul said, Don't let my hand be on him, but let the hand
        of the Philistines be on him.
018:018 David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my
        father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law
        to the king?
018:019 But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter,
        should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel
        the Meholathite as wife.
018:020 Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David:  and they told Saul,
        and the thing pleased him.
018:021 Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him,
        and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
        Therefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son-in-law
        a second time.
018:022 Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly,
        and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his
        servants love you:  now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
018:023 Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David.
        David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be the king's
        son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
018:024 The servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
018:025 Saul said, Thus shall you tell David, The king desires
        no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines,
        to be avenged of the king's enemies.  Now Saul thought to make
        David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
018:026 When his servants told David these words, it pleased David
        well to be the king's son-in-law. The days were not expired;
018:027 and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed
        of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought
        their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king,
        that he might be the king's son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal
        his daughter as wife.
018:028 Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David;
        and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
018:029 Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was
        David's enemy continually.
018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth:
        and it happened, as often as they went forth, that David
        behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul;
        so that his name was much set by.
019:001 Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
        that they should kill David.  But Jonathan, Saul's son,
        delighted much in David.
019:002 Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you:
        now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning,
        and live in a secret place, and hide yourself:
019:003 and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
        where you are, and I will commune with my father of you;
        and if I see anything, I will tell you.
019:004 Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him,
        Don't let the king sin against his servant, against David;
        because he has not sinned against you, and because his works
        have been very good toward you:
019:005 for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine,
        and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel:  you saw it,
        and did rejoice; why then will you sin against innocent blood,
        to kill David without a cause?
019:006 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan:  and Saul swore,
        As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.
019:007 Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.
        Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence,
        as before.
019:008 There was war again:  and David went out, and fought with
        the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter;
        and they fled before him.
019:009 An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house
        with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.
019:010 Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear;
        but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he struck
        the spear into the wall:  and David fled, and escaped that night.
019:011 Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him,
        and to kill him in the morning:  and Michal, David's wife,
        told him, saying, If you don't save your life tonight,
        tomorrow you will be slain.
019:012 So Michal let David down through the window:  and he went,
        and fled, and escaped.
019:013 Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put
        a pillow of goats' [hair] at the head of it, and covered it
        with the clothes.
019:014 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
019:015 Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up
        to me in the bed, that I may kill him.
019:016 When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed,
        with the pillow of goats' [hair] at the head of it.
019:017 Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my
        enemy go, so that he is escaped?  Michal answered Saul, He said
        to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?
019:018 Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
        and told him all that Saul had done to him.  He and Samuel
        went and lived in Naioth.
019:019 It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
019:020 Saul sent messengers to take David:  and when they saw the company
        of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head
        over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul,
        and they also prophesied.
019:021 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
        also prophesied.  Saul sent messengers again the third time,
        and they also prophesied.
019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well
        that is in Secu:  and he asked and said, Where are Samuel
        and David?  One said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
019:023 He went there to Naioth in Ramah:  and the Spirit of God came
        on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came
        to Naioth in Ramah.
019:024 He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied
        before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
        Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
020:001 David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said
        before Jonathan, "What have I done?  What is my iniquity?"
        and "What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"
020:002 He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die:  behold, my father
        does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it
        to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me?
        It is not so."
020:003 David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows
        well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says,
        'Don't let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:'
        but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is
        but a step between me and death."
020:004 Then said Jonathan to David, "Whatever your soul desires,
        I will even do it for you."
020:005 David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,
        and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go,
        that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.
020:006 If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly
        asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city;
        for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'
020:007 If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace:
        but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.
020:008 Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have
        brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you:
        but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why
        should you bring me to your father?"
020:009 Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all
        know that evil were determined by my father to come on you,
        then wouldn't I tell you that?"
020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance
        your father answer you roughly?"
020:011 Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field."
        They both went out into the field.
020:012 Jonathan said to David, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]:
        when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow,
        [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David,
        shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?
020:013 Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my
        father to do you evil, if I don't disclose it to you, and send
        you away, that you may go in peace:  and Yahweh be with you,
        as he has been with my father.
020:014 You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness
        of Yahweh, that I not die;
020:015 but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever;
        no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone
        from the surface of the earth."
020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying],
        Yahweh will require it at the hand of David's enemies.
020:017 Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had
        to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
020:018 Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon:
        and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
020:019 When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly,
        and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the
        business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
020:020 I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot
        at a mark.
020:021 Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows.
        If I tell the boy, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you;
        take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt,
        as Yahweh lives.
020:022 But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you;
        go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.
020:023 As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold,
        Yahweh is between you and me forever.
020:024 So David hid himself in the field:  and when the new moon was come,
        the king sat him down to eat food.
020:025 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat
        by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side:
        but David's place was empty.
020:026 Nevertheless Saul didn't say anything that day:
        for he thought, Something has happened to him.  He is not clean.
        Surely he is not clean.
020:027 It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was]
        the second [day], that David's place was empty:  and Saul said
        to Jonathan his son, Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to meat,
        neither yesterday, nor today?
020:028 Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
        to go to Bethlehem:
020:029 and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice
        in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to
        be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes,
        let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers.
        Therefore he is not come to the king's table.
020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
        to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don't I know
        that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame,
        and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall
        not be established, nor your kingdom.  Therefore now send
        and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.
020:032 Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should
        he be put to death?  What has he done?"
020:033 Saul cast his spear at him to strike him.  By this Jonathan
        knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food
        the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David,
        because his father had done him shame.
020:035 It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field
        at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.
020:036 He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.
        As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
020:037 When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which
        Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said,
        Isn't the arrow beyond you?
020:038 Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast!  Hurry!  Don't delay!
        Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
020:039 But the boy didn't know anything:  only Jonathan and David
        knew the matter.
020:040 Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go,
        carry them to the city.
020:041 As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place]
        toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground,
        and bowed himself three times:  and they kissed one another,
        and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
020:042 Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn
        both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be
        between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.
        He arose and departed:  and Jonathan went into the city.
021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest:
        and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him,
        Why are you alone, and no man with you?
021:002 David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me
        a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the
        business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you:
        and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.
021:003 Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves
        of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.
021:004 The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
        under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young
        men have kept themselves from women.
021:005 David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth
        women have been kept from us about these three days;
        when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy,
        though it was but a common journey; how much more then today
        shall their vessels be holy?
021:006 So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread
        there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh,
        to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
        detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite,
        the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
021:008 David said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear
        or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons
        with me, because the king's business required haste.
021:009 The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
        whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here
        wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod:  if you will take that,
        take it; for there is no other except that here.
        David said, There is none like that; give it me.
021:010 David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
        to Achish the king of Gath.
021:011 The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David
        the king of the land?  Didn't they sing one to another
        about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands,
        David his ten thousands?'"
021:012 David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid
        of Achish the king of Gath.
021:013 He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad
        in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
        and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
021:014 Then said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad;
        why then have you brought him to me?
021:015 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play
        the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
022:001 David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam:
        and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it,
        they went down there to him.
022:002 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt,
        and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him;
        and he became captain over them:  and there were with him
        about four hundred men.
022:003 David went there to Mizpeh of Moab:  and he said to the king
        of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth,
        [and be] with you, until I know what God will do for me.
022:004 He brought them before the king of Moab:  and they lived
        with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
022:005 The prophet Gad said to David, Don't stay in the stronghold;
        depart, and get you into the land of Judah.  Then David departed,
        and came into the forest of Hereth.
022:006 Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him:
        now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree
        in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants
        were standing about him.
022:007 Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now,
        you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give everyone of you
        fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands
        and captains of hundreds,
022:008 that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
        who discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son
        of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me,
        or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant
        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants
        of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob,
        to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
022:010 He inquired of Yahweh for him, and gave him food, and gave
        him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub,
        and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob:
        and they came all of them to the king.
022:012 Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub.  He answered,
        Here I am, my lord.
022:013 Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me,
        you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread,
        and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should
        rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, Who among all your
        servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law,
        and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?
022:015 Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me:
        don't let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to
        all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing
        of all this, less or more.
022:016 The king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all
        your father's house.
022:017 The king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill
        the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David,
        and because they knew that he fled, and didn't disclose it to me.
        But the servants of the king wouldn't put forth their hand
        to fall on the priests of Yahweh.
022:018 The king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests.
        Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests,
        and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore
        a linen ephod.
022:019 Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of
        the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies,
        and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
022:020 One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,
        escaped, and fled after David.
022:021 Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh's priests.
022:022 David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite
        was there, that he would surely tell Saul:  I have occasioned
        [the death] of all the persons of your father's house.
022:023 Abide you with me, don't be afraid; for he who seeks my life
        seeks your life:  for with me you shall be in safeguard.
023:001 They told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting
        against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.
023:002 Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike
        these Philistines?  Yahweh said to David, Go, and strike
        the Philistines, and save Keilah.
023:003 David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah:
        how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies
        of the Philistines?
023:004 Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again.  Yahweh answered him,
        and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver
        the Philistines into your hand.
023:005 David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines,
        and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a
        great slaughter.  So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
023:006 It happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David
        to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
023:007 It was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.  Saul said,
        God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in,
        by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
023:008 Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah,
        to besiege David and his men.
023:009 David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him;
        and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.
023:010 Then said David, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has
        surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy
        the city for my sake.
023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?
        will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?
        Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.
        Yahweh said, He will come down.
023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me
        and my men into the hand of Saul?  Yahweh said, They will
        deliver you up.
023:013 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and
        departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go.
        It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
        and he gave up going there.
023:014 David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds,
        and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph.
        Saul sought him every day, but God didn't deliver him
        into his hand.
023:015 David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life:
        and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
023:016 Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the wood,
        and strengthened his hand in God.
023:017 He said to him, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father
        shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I
        shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.
023:018 They two made a covenant before Yahweh:  and David abode
        in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David
        hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood,
        in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire
        of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver
        him up into the king's hand.
023:021 Saul said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had
        compassion on me.
023:022 Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place
        where his haunt is, [and] who has seen him there; for it
        is told me that he deals very subtly.
023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
        where he hides himself, and come you again to me of a certainty,
        and I will go with you:  and it shall happen, if he be in the land,
        that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
023:024 They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul:  but David and his men
        were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south
        of the desert.
023:025 Saul and his men went to seek him.  When David was told,
        he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.
        When Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the
        wilderness of Maon.
023:026 Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men
        on that side of the mountain:  and David made haste to get
        away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
        and his men round about to take them.
023:027 But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come;
        for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.
023:028 So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
        against the Philistines:  therefore they called that
        place Sela Hammahlekoth.
023:029 David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds
        of En Gedi.
024:001 It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines,
        that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness
        of En Gedi.
024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
        and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.
024:003 He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave;
        and Saul went in to relieve himself.  Now David and his men
        were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
024:004 The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh
        said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand,
        and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.
        Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.
024:005 It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him,
        because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
024:006 He said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing
        to my lord, Yahweh's anointed, to put forth my hand against him,
        seeing he is Yahweh's anointed.
024:007 So David checked his men with these words, and didn't allow
        them to rise against Saul.  Saul rose up out of the cave,
        and went on his way.
024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave,
        and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king.  When Saul
        looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth,
        and did obeisance.
024:009 David said to Saul, Why listen you to men's words, saying,
        Behold, David seeks your hurt?
024:010 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh
        had delivered you today into my hand in the cave:
        and some bade me kill you; but [my eye] spared you;
        and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord;
        for he is Yahweh's anointed.
024:011 Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe
        in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe,
        and didn't kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil
        nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you,
        though you hunt after my life to take it.
024:012 Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you;
        but my hand shall not be on you.
024:013 As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes
        forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.
024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you
        pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
024:015 Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you,
        and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.
024:016 It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
        these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice,
        my son David?  Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
024:017 He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have
        rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.
024:018 You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me,
        because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand,
        you didn't kill me.
024:019 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed?
        Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you
        have done to me this day.
024:020 Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that
        the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
024:021 Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut
        off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name
        out of my father's house.
024:022 David swore to Saul.  Saul went home; but David and his men
        got them up to the stronghold.
025:001 Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together,
        and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.
        David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
025:002 There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
        and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
        and a thousand goats:  and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail;
        and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face:
        but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was
        of the house of Caleb.
025:004 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
025:005 David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men,
        Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
025:006 and thus shall you tell him who lives [in prosperity],
        Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be
        to all that you have.
025:007 Now I have heard that you have shearers:  your shepherds have
        now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there
        anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
025:008 Ask your young men, and they will tell you:  therefore let
        the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day.
        Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants,
        and to your son David.
025:009 When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according
        to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
025:010 Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
        and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants who break
        away from their masters these days.
025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I
        have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don't
        know where they come from?
025:012 So David's young men turned on their way, and went back,
        and came and told him according to all these words.
025:013 David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword.
        They girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on
        his sword:  and there went up after David about four hundred men;
        and two hundred abode by the baggage.
025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife,
        saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness
        to Greet our master; and he railed at them.
025:015 But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt,
        neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them,
        when we were in the fields:
025:016 they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we
        were with them keeping the sheep.
025:017 Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil
        is determined against our master, and against all his house:
        for he is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to him.
025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves,
        and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
        measures of parched grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins,
        and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
025:019 She said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.
        But she didn't tell her husband, Nabal.
025:020 It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert
        of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down
        toward her; and she met them.
025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
        fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all
        that pertained to him:  and he has returned me evil for good.
025:022 God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave
        of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much
        as one who urinates on a wall.{or, male.}
025:023 When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey,
        and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself
        to the ground.
025:024 She fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be
        the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears.
        Hear the words of your handmaid.
025:025 Please don't let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal;
        for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly
        is with him:  but I your handmaid didn't see the young men
        of my lord, whom you did send.
025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives,
        seeing Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness,
        and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore
        let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord,
        be as Nabal.
025:027 Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord,
        let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
025:028 Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid:  for Yahweh
        will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord
        fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found
        in you all your days.
025:029 Though men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul,
        yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life
        with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies,
        them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.
025:030 It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my lord
        according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you,
        and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,
025:031 that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart
        to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause,
        or that my lord has avenged himself.  When Yahweh shall
        have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.
025:032 David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        who sent you this day to meet me:
025:033 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have
        kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging
        myself with my own hand.
025:034 For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has
        withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried
        and come to meet me, surely there wouldn't have been left
        to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates
        on a wall.{or, male.}
025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him:
        and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have
        listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.
025:036 Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house,
        like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him,
        for he was very drunken:  therefore she told him nothing,
        less or more, until the morning light.
025:037 It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal,
        that his wife told him these things, and his heart died
        within him, and he became as a stone.
025:038 It happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal,
        so that he died.
025:039 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh,
        who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand
        of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil:
        and the evil-doing of Nabal has Yahweh returned on his own head.
        David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to
        him as wife.
025:040 When the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
        they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take
        you to him as wife.
025:041 She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth,
        and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet
        of the servants of my lord.
025:042 Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies
        of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers
        of David, and became his wife.
025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both
        of them his wives.
025:044 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife,
        to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
026:001 The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide
        himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
        having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
        David in the wilderness of Ziph.
026:003 Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert,
        by the way.  But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw
        that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
        come of a certainty.
026:005 David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped;
        and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,
        the captain of his army:  and Saul lay within the place
        of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.
026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite,
        and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab,
        saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?
        Abishai said, I will go down with you.
026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night:
        and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons,
        with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner
        and the people lay round about him.
026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy
        into your hand this day:  now therefore please let me strike
        him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will
        not strike him the second time.
026:009 David said to Abishai, Don't destroy him; for who can put forth
        his hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be guiltless?
026:010 David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day
        shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
026:011 Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against
        Yahweh's anointed:  but now please take the spear that is at
        his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.
026:012 So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head;
        and they got them away:  and no man saw it, nor knew it,
        neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep
        sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.
026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
        of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
026:014 and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
        saying, Don't you answer, Abner?  Then Abner answered,
        Who are you who cries to the king?
026:015 David said to Abner, Aren't you a [valiant] man? and who is like
        you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord,
        the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy
        the king your lord.
026:016 This thing isn't good that you have done.  As Yahweh lives,
        you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over
        your lord, Yahweh's anointed.  Now see where the king's spear is,
        and the jar of water that was at his head.
026:017 Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice,
        my son David?  David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
026:018 He said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? for what
        have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
026:019 Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words
        of his servant.  If it be Yahweh that has stirred you
        up against me, let him accept an offering:  but if it
        be the children of men, cursed be they before Yahweh:
        for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling
        to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.
026:020 Now therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away
        from the presence of Yahweh:  for the king of Israel is
        come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge
        in the mountains.
026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned:  return, my son David;
        for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious
        in your eyes this day:  behold, I have played the fool,
        and have erred exceedingly.
026:022 David answered, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of
        the young men come over and get it.
026:023 Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and
        his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today,
        and I wouldn't put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed.
026:024 Behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes,
        so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let
        him deliver me out of all oppression.
026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David:
        you shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail.
        So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
027:001 David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand
        of Saul:  there is nothing better for me than that I should
        escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair
        of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel:
        so shall I escape out of his hand.
027:002 David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men
        who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
027:003 David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
        with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam
        the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
027:004 It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath:  and he sought
        no more again for him.
027:005 David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes,
        let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country,
        that I may dwell there:  for why should your servant dwell
        in the royal city with you?
027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day:  why Ziklag pertains
        to the kings of Judah to this day.
027:007 The number of the days that David lived in the country
        of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
027:008 David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites,
        and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those [nations] were
        the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur,
        even to the land of Egypt.
027:009 David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive,
        and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys,
        and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned,
        and came to Achish.
027:010 Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today?
        David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South
        of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
027:011 David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath,
        saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David,
        and so has been his manner all the while he has lived
        in the country of the Philistines.
027:012 Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel
        utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever.
028:001 It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered
        their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.
        Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go
        out with me in the army, you and your men.
028:002 David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant
        will do.  Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you
        keeper of my head for ever.
028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him,
        and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.  Saul had
        put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        out of the land.
028:004 The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
        encamped in Shunem:  and Saul gathered all Israel together,
        and they encamped in Gilboa.
028:005 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid,
        and his heart trembled greatly.
028:006 When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn't answer him,
        neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
028:007 Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who has
        a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.
        His servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has
        a familiar spirit at Endor.
028:008 Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went,
        he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night:
        and he said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit,
        and bring me up whoever I shall name to you.
028:009 The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done,
        how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        out of the land:  why then lay you a snare for my life,
        to cause me to die?
028:010 Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives,
        there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.
028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you?
        He said, Bring me up Samuel.
028:012 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice;
        and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived
        me? for you are Saul.
028:013 The king said to her, Don't be afraid:  for what do you see?
        The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
028:014 He said to her, What form is he of?  She said, An old man
        comes up; and he is covered with a robe.  Saul perceived
        that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground,
        and did obeisance.
028:015 Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up?
        Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
        make war against me, and God is departed from me,
        and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
        therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me
        what I shall do.
028:016 Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed
        from you, and is become your adversary?
028:017 Yahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me:  and Yahweh has torn
        the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor,
        even to David.
028:018 Because you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn't execute
        his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this
        thing to you this day.
028:019 Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand
        of the Philistines; and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me:
        Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand
        of the Philistines.
028:020 Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth,
        and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel:
        and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread
        all the day, nor all the night.
028:021 The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
        and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice,
        and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your
        words which you spoke to me.
028:022 Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid,
        and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat,
        that you may have strength, when you go on your way.
028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat.  But his servants,
        together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened
        to their voice.  So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.
028:024 The woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried,
        and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did
        bake unleavened bread of it:
028:025 and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants;
        and they ate.  Then they rose up, and went away that night.
029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
        and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.
029:002 The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands;
        and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do]
        these Hebrews [here]?  Achish said to the princes of
        the Philistines, Isn't this David, the servant of Saul the king
        of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather]
        these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell
        away [to me] to this day?
029:004 But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him;
        and the princes of the Philistines said to him,
        Make the man return, that he may go back to his place
        where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us
        to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us:
        for with what should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his
        lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?
029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
        saying, Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?
029:006 Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives,
        you have been upright, and your going out and your coming
        in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found
        evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day:
        nevertheless the lords don't favor you.
029:007 Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease
        the lords of the Philistines.
029:008 David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you
        found in your servant so long as I have been before you
        to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies
        of my lord the king?
029:009 Achish answered David, I know that you are good in my sight,
        as an angel of God:  notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines
        have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
029:010 Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants
        of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up
        early in the morning, and have light, depart.
029:011 So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in
        the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines.
        The Philistines went up to Jezreel.
030:001 It happened, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on
        the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South,
        and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
030:002 and had taken captive the women [and all] who were therein,
        both small and great:  they didn't kill any, but carried them off,
        and went their way.
030:003 When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned
        with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters,
        were taken captive.
030:004 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their
        voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
030:005 David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
        and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
030:006 David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him,
        because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man
        for his sons and for his daughters:  but David strengthened
        himself in Yahweh his God.
030:007 David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Please bring
        me here the ephod.  Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.
030:008 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop,
        shall I overtake them?  He answered him, Pursue; for you shall
        surely overtake [them], and shall without fail recover [all].
030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,
        and came to the brook Besor, where those who were
        left behind stayed.
030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred
        stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over
        the brook Besor.
030:011 They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David,
        and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.
030:012 They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins:
        and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him;
        for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days
        and three nights.
030:013 David said to him, To whom belong you? and whence are you?
        He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;
        and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
030:014 We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on
        that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb;
        and we burned Ziklag with fire.
030:015 David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop?
        He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me,
        nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring
        you down to this troop.
030:016 When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad
        over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing,
        because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of
        the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
030:017 David struck them from the twilight even to the evening
        of the next day:  and there not a man of them escaped,
        except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.
030:018 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David
        rescued his two wives.
030:019 There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
        neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything
        that they had taken to them:  David brought back all.
030:020 David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove
        before those [other] livestock, and said, This is David's spoil.
030:021 David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they
        could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide
        at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David,
        and to meet the people who were with him:  and when David
        came near to the people, he greeted them.
030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who
        went with David, and said, Because they didn't go with us,
        we will not give them anything of the spoil that we
        have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children,
        that he may lead them away, and depart.
030:023 Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers,
        with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us,
        and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
030:024 Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is
        who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries
        by the baggage:  they shall share alike.
030:025 It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
        and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
030:026 When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders
        of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present
        for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:
030:027 To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth
        of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,
030:028 and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth,
        and to those who were in Eshtemoa,
030:029 and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities
        of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities
        of the Kenites,
030:030 and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan,
        and to those who were in Athach,
030:031 and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where
        David himself and his men used to stay.
031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel:  and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        on Mount Gilboa.
031:002 The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons;
        and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua,
        the sons of Saul.
031:003 The battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him;
        and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
031:004 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust
        me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust
        me through, and abuse me.  But his armor bearer would not;
        for he was sore afraid.  Therefore Saul took his sword,
        and fell on it.
031:005 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell
        on his sword, and died with him.
031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer,
        and all his men, that same day together.
031:007 When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley,
        and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men
        of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
        and lived in them.
031:008 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip
        the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen
        on Mount Gilboa.
031:009 They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent
        into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the news
        to the house of their idols, and to the people.
031:010 They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they
        fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
031:011 When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him
        that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
031:012 all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body
        of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan;
        and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
031:013 They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree
        in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
Book 10 2 Samuel
001:001 It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned
        from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode
        two days in Ziklag;
001:002 it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of
        the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head:
        and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth,
        and did obeisance.
001:003 David said to him, From whence come you?  He said to him,
        Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
001:004 David said to him, How went the matter?  Please tell me.
        He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many
        of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan
        his son are dead also.
001:005 David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul
        and Jonathan his son are dead?
001:006 The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on
        Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold,
        the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
001:007 When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me.
        I answered, Here am I.
001:008 He said to me, Who are you?  I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
001:009 He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me;
        for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet
        whole in me.
001:010 So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was
        sure that he could not live after that he was fallen:
        and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet
        that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them;
        and likewise all the men who were with him:
001:012 and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh,
        and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen
        by the sword.
001:013 David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you?
        He answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.
001:014 David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your
        hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?
001:015 David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
        and fall on him.  He struck him, so that he died.
001:016 David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has
        testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.
001:017 David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son
001:018 (and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of]
        the bow:  behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
001:019 Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!
        How the mighty have fallen!
001:020 Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't publish it in the streets
        of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
        lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
001:021 You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you,
        neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of
        the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul was not
        anointed with oil.
001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
        Jonathan's bow didn't turn back.  Saul's sword didn't return empty.
001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
        In their death, they were not divided.  They were swifter
        than eagles.  They were stronger than lions.
001:024 You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
        Jonathan is slain on your high places.
001:026 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.  You have
        been very pleasant to me.  Your love to me was wonderful,
        passing the love of women.
001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
002:001 It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying,
        Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?  Yahweh said
        to him, Go up.  David said, Where shall I go up?
        He said, To Hebron.
002:002 So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam
        the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
002:003 His men who were with him did David bring up, every man
        with his household:  and they lived in the cities of Hebron.
002:004 The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah.  They told David, saying, The men
        of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.
002:005 David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said
        to them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have shown this
        kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
002:006 Now Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you:
        and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have
        done this thing.
002:007 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant;
        for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah
        have anointed me king over them.
002:008 Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
002:009 and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites,
        and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin,
        and over all Israel.
002:010 Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began
        to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.
        But the house of Judah followed David.
002:011 The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah
        was seven years and six months.
002:012 Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
        of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
002:013 Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
        and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down,
        the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other
        side of the pool.
002:014 Abner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play
        before us.  Joab said, Let them arise.
002:015 Then they arose and went over by number:  twelve for Benjamin,
        and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the
        servants of David.
002:016 They caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust]
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim,
        which is in Gibeon.
002:017 The battle was very severe that day:  and Abner was beaten,
        and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
002:018 The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel:
        and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.
002:019 Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn
        to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel?
        He answered, It is I.
002:021 Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left,
        and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor.
        But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
002:022 Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me:
        why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold
        up my face to Joab your brother?
002:023 However he refused to turn aside:  therefore Abner with the hinder
        end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came
        out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place:
        and it happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel
        fell down and died stood still.
002:024 But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner:  and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
002:025 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
        and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever?
        Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
        How long shall it be then, before you bid the people return
        from following their brothers?"
002:027 Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then
        in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed
        everyone his brother.
002:028 So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still,
        and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
002:029 Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah;
        and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron,
        and came to Mahanaim.
002:030 Joab returned from following Abner:  and when he had gathered
        all the people together, there lacked of David's servants
        nineteen men and Asahel.
002:031 But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men,
        [so that] three hundred sixty men died.
002:032 They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father,
        which was in Bethlehem.  Joab and his men went all night,
        and the day broke on them at Hebron.
003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
        of David:  and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house
        of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
003:002 To David were sons born in Hebron:  and his firstborn was Amnon,
        of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
003:003 and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
        and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai
        king of Geshur;
003:004 and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
        Shephatiah the son of Abital;
003:005 and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife.
        These were born to David in Hebron.
003:006 It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul
        and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        in the house of Saul.
003:007 Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
        of Aiah:  and [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone
        in to my father's concubine?
003:008 Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said,
        Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?  This day do I show
        kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand
        of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault
        concerning this woman.
003:009 God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn
        to David, I don't do even so to him;
003:010 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set
        up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan
        even to Beersheba.
003:011 He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
003:012 Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is
        the land? saying [also], Make your league with me, and behold,
        my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.
003:013 He said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing
        I require of you:  that is, you shall not see my face,
        except you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come
        to see my face.
003:014 David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me
        for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
003:015 Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Paltiel the son of Laish.
003:016 Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed
        her to Bahurim.  Then said Abner to him, Go, return:
        and he returned.
003:017 Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        In times past you sought for David to be king over you:
003:018 now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand
        of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand
        of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
003:019 Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin:  and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.
        David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.
003:021 Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel
        to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you,
        and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.
        David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
003:022 Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray,
        and brought in a great spoil with them:  but Abner was not
        with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
        gone in peace.
003:023 When Joab and all the army who was with him had come,
        they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king,
        and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold,
        Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away,
        and he is quite gone?
003:025 You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you,
        and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know
        all that you do.
003:026 When Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah:
        but David didn't know it.
003:027 When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into
        the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck
        him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood
        of Asahel his brother.
003:028 Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner:
003:029 let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house;
        and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has
        an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff,
        or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.
003:030 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had
        killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
003:031 David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him,
        Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner.  King David followed the bier.
003:032 They buried Abner in Hebron:  and the king lifted up his voice,
        and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
003:033 The king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die
        as a fool dies?
003:034 Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters.
        As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.
        All the people wept again over him.
003:035 All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day;
        but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also,
        if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down.
003:036 All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them;
        as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
003:037 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
        was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.
003:038 The king said to his servants, "Don't you know that there
        a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
003:039 I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
        the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me.  May Yahweh reward
        the evil-doer according to his wickedness."
004:001 When [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron,
        his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
004:002 [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men who were captains of bands:
        the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
        the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin
        (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
004:003 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners
        there until this day).
004:004 Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet.
        He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan
        out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled:
        and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
        and became lame.  His name was Mephibosheth.
004:005 The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
        and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth,
        as he took his rest at noon.
004:006 They came there into the midst of the house, as though they
        would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body:
        and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
004:007 Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed
        in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him,
        and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way
        of the Arabah all night.
004:008 They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron,
        and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth,
        the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life;
        and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul,
        and of his seed.
004:009 David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons
        of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives,
        who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
004:010 when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
        brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag,
        which was the reward I gave him for his news.
004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
        in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood
        of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
004:012 David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut
        off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside
        the pool in Hebron.  But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
        and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron,
        and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
005:002 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you
        who led out and brought in Israel:  and Yahweh said to you,
        You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall
        be prince over Israel.
005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
        and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh:
        and they anointed David king over Israel.
005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned forty years.
005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months;
        and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all
        Israel and Judah.
005:006 The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites,
        the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying,
        Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not
        come in here; thinking, David can't come in here.
005:007 Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is
        the city of David.
005:008 David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites,
        let him get up to the watercourse, and [strike]
        the lame and the blind, who are hated of David's soul.
        Therefore they say, There are the blind and the lame;
        he can't come into the house.
005:009 David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David.
        David built round about from Millo and inward.
005:010 David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies,
        was with him.
005:011 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
        and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
005:012 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel,
        and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
005:013 David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
        after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons
        and daughters born to David.
005:014 These are the names of those who were born to him
        in Jerusalem:  Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
005:015 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
005:016 and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
005:017 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
        over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David;
        and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
005:018 Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the
        valley of Rephaim.
005:019 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against
        the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand?
        Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver
        the Philistines into your hand.
005:020 David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said,
        Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.
        Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
005:021 They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
005:022 The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
        in the valley of Rephaim.
005:023 When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You shall not go up:
        make a circuit behind them, and come on them over against
        the mulberry trees.
005:024 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops
        of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself;
        for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the army
        of the Philistines.
005:025 David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines
        from Geba until you come to Gezer.
006:001 David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
        thirty thousand.
006:002 David arose, and went with all the people who were with him,
        from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God,
        which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies
        who sits [above] the cherubim.
006:003 They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it
        out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill:
        and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
006:004 They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill,
        with the ark of God:  and Ahio went before the ark.
006:005 David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all
        manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, and with harps,
        and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines,
        and with castanets, and with cymbals.
006:006 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put
        forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it;
        for the oxen stumbled.
006:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck
        him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
006:008 David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah;
        and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.
006:009 David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How shall
        the ark of Yahweh come to me?
006:010 So David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into
        the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house
        of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
006:011 The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom
        the Gittite three months:  and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom,
        and all his house.
006:012 It was told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house
        of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark
        of God.  David went and brought up the ark of God from the house
        of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.
006:013 It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone
        six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
006:014 David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was
        girded with a linen ephod.
006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh
        with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
006:016 It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David,
        that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window,
        and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh;
        and she despised him in her heart.
006:017 They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place,
        in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David
        offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
006:018 When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering
        and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name
        of Yahweh of Armies.
006:019 He dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
        of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a cake
        of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.
        So all the people departed everyone to his house.
006:020 Then David returned to bless his household.
        Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said,
        How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered
        himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants,
        as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
006:021 David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me
        above your father, and above all his house, to appoint
        me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel:
        therefore will I play before Yahweh.
006:022 I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my
        own sight:  but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken,
        they shall honor me.
006:023 Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
007:001 It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh
        had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
007:002 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
        in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
007:003 Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart;
        for Yahweh is with you.
007:004 It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came
        to Nathan, saying,
007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh, Shall you
        build me a house for me to dwell in?
007:006 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought
        up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day,
        but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.
007:007 In all places in which I have walked with all the children
        of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
        whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying,
        Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
007:008 Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says
        Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following
        the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel;
007:009 and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all
        your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name,
        like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
007:010 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
        that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more;
        neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,
        as at the first,
007:011 and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies.
        Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.
007:012 When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers,
        I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out
        of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
007:013 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish
        the throne of his kingdom forever.
007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son:
        if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men,
        and with the stripes of the children of men;
007:015 but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took
        it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
007:016 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you:
        your throne shall be established forever.
007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
        so did Nathan speak to David.
007:018 Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh;
        and he said, Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house,
        that you have brought me thus far?
007:019 This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have
        spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come;
        and this [too] after the manner of men, Lord Yahweh!
007:020 What can David say more to you? for you know your servant,
        Lord Yahweh.
007:021 For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you
        worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
007:022 Therefore you are great, Yahweh God:  for there is none like you,
        neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we
        have heard with our ears.
007:023 What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make
        him a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things
        for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to you
        out of Egypt, [from] the nations and their gods?
007:024 You did establish to yourself your people Israel to be a people
        to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
007:025 Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning
        your servant, and concerning his house, confirm you it forever,
        and do as you have spoken.
007:026 Let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies
        is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall
        be established before you.
007:027 For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed
        to your servant, saying, I will build you a house:
        therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this
        prayer to you.
007:028 Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth,
        and you have promised this good thing to your servant:
007:029 now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant,
        that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh,
        have spoken it:  and with your blessing let the house of your
        servant be blessed forever.
008:001 After this it happened that David struck the Philistines,
        and subdued them:  and David took the bridle of the mother
        city out of the hand of the Philistines.
008:002 He struck Moab, and measured them with the line,
        making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two
        lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive.
        The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
008:003 David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
        as he went to recover his dominion at the River.
008:004 David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty
        thousand footmen:  and David hamstrung all the chariot horses,
        but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
008:005 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king
        of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the
        Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
008:007 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
008:008 From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
        took exceeding much brass.
008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all
        the army of Hadadezer,
008:010 then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to Greet him,
        and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer
        and struck him:  for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.
        [Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold,
        and vessels of brass:
008:011 These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver
        and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
008:012 of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
        the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
        son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
008:013 David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians
        in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
008:014 He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
        and all the Edomites became servants to David.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
008:015 David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice
        and righteousness to all his people.
008:016 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;
008:017 and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,
        were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
008:018 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.
009:001 David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul,
        that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
009:002 There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba,
        and they called him to David; and the king said to him,
        Are you Ziba?  He said, Your servant is he.
009:003 The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I
        may show the kindness of God to him?  Ziba said to the king,
        Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.
009:004 The king said to him, Where is he?  Ziba said to the king,
        Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel,
        in Lo Debar.
009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir
        the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
009:006 Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
        came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance.
        David said, Mephibosheth.  He answered, Behold, your servant!
009:007 David said to him, "Don't be afraid of him; for I will
        surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake,
        and will restore you all the land of Saul your father;
        and you shall eat bread at my table continually."
009:008 He did obeisance, and said, "What is your servant, that you
        should look on such a dead dog as I am?"
009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him,
        "All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given
        to your master's son.
009:010 You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons,
        and your servants; and you shall bring in [the fruits],
        that your master's son may have bread to eat:  but Mephibosheth
        your master's son shall eat bread always at my table."
        Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
009:011 Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord
        the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do.
        As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table,
        as one of the king's sons.
009:012 Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
        All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
009:013 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually
        at the king's table.  He was lame in both his feet.
010:001 It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died,
        and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
010:002 David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,
        as his father shown kindness to me.  So David sent
        by his servants to comfort him concerning his father.
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
010:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun
        their lord, Do you think that David honors your father,
        in that he has sent comforters to you?  Hasn't David sent
        his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out,
        and to overthrow it?
010:004 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half
        of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,
        even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
010:005 When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men
        were greatly ashamed.  The king said, Wait at Jericho until
        your beards be grown, and then return.
010:006 When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious
        to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians
        of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen,
        and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men
        of Tob twelve thousand men.
010:007 When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army
        of the mighty men.
010:008 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
        at the entrance of the gate:  and the Syrians of Zobah and
        of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves
        in the field.
010:009 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians:
010:010 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai
        his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
010:011 He said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall
        help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you,
        then I will come and help you.
010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people,
        and for the cities of our God:  and Yahweh do that which
        seems him good.
010:013 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle
        against the Syrians:  and they fled before him.
010:014 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city.
        Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon,
        and came to Jerusalem.
010:015 When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
        they gathered themselves together.
010:016 Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond
        the River:  and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain
        of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
010:017 It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam.  The Syrians
        set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
010:018 The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians
        [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen,
        and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that
        he died there.
010:019 When all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they
        were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel,
        and served them.  So the Syrians feared to help the children
        of Ammon any more.
011:001 It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go
        out [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him,
        and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon,
        and besieged Rabbah.  But David stayed at Jerusalem.
011:002 It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed,
        and walked on the roof of the king's house:  and from the roof
        he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful
        to look on.
011:003 David send and inquired after the woman.  One said,
        Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife
        of Uriah the Hittite?
011:004 David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him,
        and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness);
        and she returned to her house.
011:005 The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said,
        I am with child.
011:006 David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite.
        Joab sent Uriah to David.
011:007 When Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did,
        and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
011:008 David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet.
        Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed
        him a mess [of food] from the king.
011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all
        the servants of his lord, and didn't go down to his house.
011:010 When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house,
        David said to Uriah, Haven't you come from a journey? why
        did you not go down to your house?
011:011 Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
        abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
        are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house,
        to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live,
        and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
011:012 David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I
        will let you depart.  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
        and the next day.
011:013 When David had called him, he ate and drink before him;
        and he made him drunk:  and at even he went out to lie on
        his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn't go down
        to his house.
011:014 It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab,
        and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
011:015 He wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront
        of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may
        be struck, and die.
011:016 It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned
        Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.
011:017 The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab:
        and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David;
        and Uriah the Hittite died also.
011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
011:019 and he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end
        of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,
011:020 it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he tells you,
        'Why did you go so near to the city to fight?  Didn't you
        know that they would shoot from the wall?
011:021 who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  Didn't a woman
        cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died
        at Thebez?  Why did you go so near the wall?' then shall you say,
        'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shown David all that Joab
        had sent him for.
011:023 The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us,
        and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even
        to the entrance of the gate.
011:024 The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall;
        and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant
        Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
011:025 Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don't let
        this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well
        as another; make your battle more strong against the city,
        and overthrow it:  and encourage you him.
011:026 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,
        she made lamentation for her husband.
011:027 When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home
        to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.
        But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.
012:001 Yahweh sent Nathan to David.  He came to him, and said
        to him, "There were two men in one city; the one rich,
        and the other poor.
012:002 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
012:003 but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb,
        which he had bought and raised.  It grew up together with him,
        and with his children.  It ate of his own food, drank of his
        own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.
012:004 A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his
        own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
        man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb,
        and dressed it for the man who had come to him."
012:005 David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said
        to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is
        worthy to die!
012:006 He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,
        and because he had no pity!"
012:007 Nathan said to David, "You are the man.  This is what Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, says:  'I anointed you king over Israel,
        and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
012:008 I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into
        your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah;
        and if that would have been too little, I would have added
        to you many more such things.
012:009 Why have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which
        is evil in his sight?  You have struck Uriah the Hittite
        with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife,
        and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
012:010 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house,
        because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah
        the Hittite to be your wife.'
012:011 This is what Yahweh says:  'Behold, I will raise up evil
        against you out of your own house; and I will take your
        wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor,
        and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
012:012 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel,
        and before the sun.'"
012:013 David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh."
        Nathan said to David, "Yahweh also has put away your sin.
        You will not die.
012:014 However, because by this deed you have given great occasion
        to Yahweh's enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born
        to you shall surely die."
012:015 Nathan departed to his house.  Yahweh struck the child that
        Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
012:016 David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted,
        and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
012:017 The elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him,
        to raise him up from the earth:  but he would not, neither did
        he eat bread with them.
012:018 It happened on the seventh day, that the child died.
        The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead;
        for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive,
        we spoke to him, and he didn't listen to our voice:
        how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
        child is dead!
012:019 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together,
        David perceived that the child was dead; and David said
        to his servants, Is the child dead?  They said, He is dead.
012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,
        and changed his clothing; and he came into the house
        of Yahweh, and worshiped:  then he came to his own house;
        and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
012:021 Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have
        done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;
        but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
012:022 He said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
        for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me,
        that the child may live?
012:023 But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again?
        I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
012:024 David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay
        with her:  and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon.
        Yahweh loved him;
012:025 and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named
        him Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.
012:026 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and took the royal city.
012:027 Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
        against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of waters.
012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together,
        and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city,
        and it be called after my name.
012:029 David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
        and fought against it, and took it.
012:030 He took the crown of their king from off his head;
        and the weight of it was a talent of gold, and [in it
        were] precious stones; and it was set on David's head.
        He brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
012:031 He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them
        under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes
        of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln:
        and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
013:001 It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had
        a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son
        of David loved her.
013:002 Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar;
        for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do
        anything to her.
013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son
        of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
013:004 He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day
        to day?  Won't you tell me?  Amnon said to him, I love Tamar,
        my brother Absalom's sister.
013:005 Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign
        yourself sick:  and when your father comes to see you,
        tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread
        to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it,
        and eat it from her hand.
013:006 So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick:  and when the king
        was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her
        sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight,
        that I may eat from her hand.
013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother
        Amnon's house, and dress him food.
013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.
        She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight,
        and did bake the cakes.
013:009 She took the pan, and poured them out before him;
        but he refused to eat.  Amnon said, Have out all men from me.
        They went out every man from him.
013:010 Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may
        eat from your hand.  Tamar took the cakes which she had made,
        and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
013:011 When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her,
        and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
013:012 She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such
        thing ought to be done in Israel.  Don't you do this folly.
013:013 I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be
        as one of the fools in Israel.  Now therefore, please speak
        to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
013:014 However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger
        than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
013:015 Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred
        with which he hated her was greater than the love with which
        he had loved her.  Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
013:016 She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting
        me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me.
        But he would not listen to her.
013:017 Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said,
        Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
013:018 She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such
        robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed.
        Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
013:019 Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various
        colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head,
        and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
013:020 Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother
        been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister:
        he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart.
        So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
013:022 Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom
        hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
013:023 It happened after two full years, that Absalom had
        sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim:
        and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
013:024 Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant
        has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants
        go with your servant.
013:025 The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go,
        lest we be burdensome to you.  He pressed him:
        however he would not go, but blessed him.
013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.
        The king said to him, Why should he go with you?
013:027 But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's
        sons go with him.
013:028 Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now,
        when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you,
        Smite Amnon, then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I
        commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
013:029 The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
        Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up
        on his mule, and fled.
013:030 It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came
        to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons,
        and there is not one of them left.
013:031 Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth;
        and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
013:032 Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, Don't let
        my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men
        the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment
        of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced
        his sister Tamar.
013:033 Now therefore don't let my lord the king take the thing
        to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead;
        for Amnon only is dead.
013:034 But Absalom fled.  The young man who kept the watch lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming
        by way of the hillside behind him.
013:035 Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are come:
        as your servant said, so it is.
013:036 It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold,
        the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept:
        and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur,
        king of Geshur.  [David] mourned for his son every day.
013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
013:039 [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom:
        for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
        was toward Absalom.
014:002 Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman,
        and said to her, please act like a mourner, and put on
        mourning clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil,
        but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead:
014:003 and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him.
        So Joab put the words in her mouth.
014:004 When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face
        to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
014:005 The king said to her, What ails you?  She answered, Of a truth
        I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
014:006 Your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field,
        and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other,
        and killed him.
014:007 Behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid,
        and they say, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we
        may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed,
        and so destroy the heir also.  Thus will they quench my coal
        which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor
        remainder on the surface of the earth.
014:008 The king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give
        charge concerning you.
014:009 The woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king,
        the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king
        and his throne be guiltless.
014:010 The king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me,
        and he shall not touch you any more.
014:011 Then said she, Please let the king remember Yahweh your God,
        that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they
        destroy my son.  He said, As Yahweh lives, there shall not
        one hair of your son fall to the earth.
014:012 Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word
        to my lord the king.  He said, Say on.
014:013 The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against
        the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is
        as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home
        again his banished one.
014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground,
        which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take
        away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be
        an outcast from him.
014:015 Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my
        lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
        and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king;
        it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand
        of the man who would destroy me and my son together out
        of the inheritance of God.
014:017 Then your handmaid said, Please let the word of my lord the king
        be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king
        to discern good and bad:  and Yahweh your God be with you.
014:018 Then the king answered the woman, Please don't hide anything
        from me that I shall ask you.  The woman said, Let my lord
        the king now speak.
014:019 The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?
        The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord the king,
        none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything
        that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab,
        he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth
        of your handmaid;
014:020 to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done
        this thing:  and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom
        of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
014:021 The king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
        go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
014:022 Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance,
        and blessed the king:  and Joab said, Today your servant knows
        that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that
        the king has performed the request of his servant.
014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
014:024 The king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him
        not see my face.  So Absalom turned to his own house,
        and didn't see the king's face.
014:025 Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom
        for his beauty:  from the sole of his foot even to the crown
        of his head there was no blemish in him.
014:026 When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end
        that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it);
        he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels,
        after the king's weight.
014:027 To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
        whose name was Tamar:  she was a woman of a beautiful face.
014:028 Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see
        the king's face.
014:029 Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king;
        but he would not come to him:  and he sent again a second time,
        but he would not come.
014:030 Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's field is
        near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.
        Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said
        to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
014:032 Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here,
        that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come
        from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still.
        Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be
        iniquity in me, let him kill me.
014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called
        for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face
        to the ground before the king:  and the king kissed Absalom.
015:001 It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot
        and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
015:002 Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
        and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should
        come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him,
        and said, Of what city are you?  He said, Your servant is
        of one of the tribes of Israel.
015:003 Absalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right;
        but there is no man deputized of the king to hear you.
015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
        that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me,
        and I would do him justice!
015:005 It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance,
        he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
015:006 In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king
        for judgment:  so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
015:007 It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said
        to the king, please let me go and pay my vow, which I have
        vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.
015:008 For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
        saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem,
        then I will serve Yahweh.
015:009 The king said to him, Go in peace.  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet,
        then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
015:011 With Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited,
        and went in their simplicity; and they didn't know anything.
015:012 Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor,
        from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering
        the sacrifices.  The conspiracy was strong; for the people
        increased continually with Absalom.
015:013 There came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men
        of Israel are after Absalom.
015:014 David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise,
        and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom:
        make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring
        down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
015:015 The king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants
        are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.
015:016 The king went forth, and all his household after him.
        The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.
015:017 The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they
        stayed in Beth Merhak.
015:018 All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
        and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men
        who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with
        us? return, and abide with the king:  for you are a foreigner,
        and also an exile; [return] to your own place.
015:020 Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go
        up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? return you,
        and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.
015:021 Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my
        lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king
        shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will
        your servant be.
015:022 David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.  Ittai the Gittite
        passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who
        were with him.
015:023 All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
        passed over:  the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron,
        and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
015:024 Behold, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him,
        bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down
        the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people
        had done passing out of the city.
015:025 The king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city:
        if I shall find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring
        me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
015:026 but if he say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I,
        let him do to me as seems good to him.
015:027 The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer?
        Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
        Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
015:028 Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word
        comes from you to inform me."
015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again
        to Jerusalem:  and they abode there.
015:030 David went up by the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept
        as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot:
        and all the people who were with him covered every man his head,
        and they went up, weeping as they went up.
015:031 One told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
        with Absalom.  David said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel
        of Ahithophel into foolishness.
015:032 It happened that when David had come to the top [of the ascent],
        where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came
        to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.
015:033 David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be
        a burden to me:
015:034 but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be
        your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant
        in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you
        defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
015:035 Don't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you?
        therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear
        out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and
        Abiathar the priests.
015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons,
        Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them
        you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.
015:037 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom
        came into Jerusalem.
016:001 When David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold,
        Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple
        of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread,
        and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits,
        and a bottle of wine.
016:002 The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these?
        Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on;
        and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat;
        and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
016:003 The king said, Where is your master's son?  Ziba said
        to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said,
        Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
        of my father.
016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains
        to Mephibosheth is yours.  Ziba said, I do obeisance;
        let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.
016:005 When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of
        the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera.
        He came out, and cursed still as he came.
016:006 He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
        and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right
        hand and on his left.
016:007 Thus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man
        of blood, and base fellow:
016:008 Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul,
        in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered
        the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and behold,
        you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a
        man of blood.
016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king,
        "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?
        Please let me go over and take off his head."
016:010 The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons
        of Zeruiah?  Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said
        to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?
016:011 David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold,
        my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life:
        how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone,
        and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.
016:012 It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me,
        and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing
        of me this day.
016:013 So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along
        on the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went,
        and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
016:014 The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary;
        and he refreshed himself there.
016:015 Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
        and Ahithophel with him.
016:016 It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come
        to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king,
        [Long] live the king.
016:017 Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend?
        Why didn't you go with your friend?
016:018 Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people,
        and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be,
        and with him will I abide.
016:019 Again, whom should I serve?  Shouldn't I serve in the presence
        of his son? as I have served in your father's presence,
        so will I be in your presence.
016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what
        we shall do.
016:021 Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines,
        that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear
        that you are abhorred of your father:  then will the hands
        of all who are with you be strong.
016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house;
        and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight
        of all Israel.
016:023 The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days,
        was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God:  so was all
        the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose
        out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after
        David this night:
017:002 and I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will
        make him afraid; and all the people who are with him shall flee;
        and I will strike the king only;
017:003 and I will bring back all the people to you:  the man whom
        you seek is as if all returned:  [so] all the people shall
        be in peace.
017:004 The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
        us hear likewise what he says.
017:006 When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him,
        saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner:
        shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak up.
017:007 Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given
        this time is not good.
017:008 Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men,
        that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds,
        as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father
        is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place:
        and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first,
        that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among
        the people who follow Absalom.
017:010 Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
        will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father
        is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
017:011 But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea
        for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
017:012 So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found,
        and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground;
        and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not
        leave so much as one.
017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
        bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
        until there not be one small stone found there.
017:014 Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
        the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
        For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel,
        to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.
017:015 Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
        thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
        and thus and thus have I counseled.
017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge
        this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means
        pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people
        who are with him.
017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female
        servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David:
        for they might not be seen to come into the city.
017:018 But a boy saw them, and told Absalom:  and they went both of them
        away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim,
        who had a well in his court; and they went down there.
017:019 The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth,
        and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.
017:020 Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said,
        Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?  The woman said to them,
        They have gone over the brook of water.  When they had sought
        and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
017:021 It happened, after they had departed, that they came up
        out of the well, and went and told king David; and they
        said to David, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water;
        for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.
017:022 Then David arose, and all the people who were with him,
        and they passed over the Jordan:  by the morning light there
        lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.
017:023 When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,
        he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city,
        and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died,
        and was buried in the tomb of his father.
017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim.  Absalom passed over the Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.
017:025 Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab.
        Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra
        the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
017:026 Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
017:027 It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
        the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai
        the Gileadite of Rogelim,
017:028 brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat,
        and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans,
        and lentils, and parched [pulse],
017:029 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd,
        for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat:
        for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty,
        in the wilderness.
018:001 David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains
        of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
018:002 David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son
        of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand
        of Ittai the Gittite.  The king said to the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.
018:003 But the people said, You shall not go forth:  for if we flee away,
        they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
        will they care for us:  but you are worth ten thousand of us;
        therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us
        out of the city.
018:004 The king said to them, What seems you best I will do.
        The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out
        by hundreds and by thousands.
018:005 The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
        gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        All the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.
018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel:
        and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
018:007 The people of Israel were struck there before the servants
        of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day
        of twenty thousand men.
018:008 For the battle was there spread over the surface of all
        the country; and the forest devoured more people that day
        than the sword devoured.
018:009 Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.
        Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under
        the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold
        of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth;
        and the mule that was under him went on.
018:010 A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
        Absalom hanging in an oak.
018:011 Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it,
        and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? and I
        would have given you ten [pieces of] silver, and a sash.
018:012 The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        [pieces of] silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth
        my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king
        charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.
018:013 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there
        is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would
        have set yourself against [me].
018:014 Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you.  He took three darts
        in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
        while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
018:015 Ten young men who bore Joab's armor compassed about and
        struck Absalom, and killed him.
018:016 Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
        after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
018:017 They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest,
        and raised over him a very great heap of stones:
        and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.
018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up
        for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale;
        for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory:
        and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called
        Absalom's monument, to this day.
018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.
018:020 Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day,
        but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall
        bear no news, because the king's son is dead.
018:021 Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen.
        The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come
        what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite.
        Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will
        have no reward for the news?
018:023 But come what may, [said he], I will run.  He said to him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
018:024 Now David was sitting between the two gates:  and the watchman
        went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
018:025 The watchman cried, and told the king.  The king said,
        If he be alone, there is news in his mouth.  He came apace,
        and drew near.
018:026 The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called
        to the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone.
        The king said, He also brings news.
018:027 The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is
        like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.  The king said,
        He is a good man, and comes with good news.
018:028 Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well.
        He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth,
        and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up
        the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
018:029 The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?
        Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant,
        even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know
        what it was.
018:030 The king said, Turn aside, and stand here.  He turned aside,
        and stood still.
018:031 Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my
        lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all
        those who rose up against you.
018:032 The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young
        man Absalom?  The Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord
        the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt,
        be as that young man is.
018:033 The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,
        and wept:  and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom,
        my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom,
        my son, my son!
019:001 It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
019:002 The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people;
        for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.
019:003 The people got them by stealth that day into the city,
        as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
019:004 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
        my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!
019:005 Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed
        this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved
        your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters,
        and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
019:006 in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you.
        For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are
        nothing to you:  for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived,
        and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably
        to your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't
        go forth, there will not stay a man with you this night:
        and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has
        happened to you from your youth until now.
019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  They told to all
        the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate:
        and all the people came before the king.  Now Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.
019:009 All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
        of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of
        our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines;
        and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
019:010 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
        Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing
        the king back?
019:011 King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
        Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last
        to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all
        Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house.
019:012 You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh:
        why then are you the last to bring back the king?
019:013 Say you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain
        of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.
019:014 He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of]
        one man; so that they sent to the king, [saying], Return you,
        and all your servants.
019:015 So the king returned, and came to the Jordan.  Judah came to Gilgal,
        to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
019:016 Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim,
        hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
019:017 There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan
        in the presence of the king.
019:018 A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household,
        and to do what he thought good.  Shimei the son of Gera fell
        down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
019:019 He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me,
        neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely
        the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,
        that the king should take it to his heart.
019:020 For your servant does know that I have sinned:  therefore, behold,
        I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go
        down to meet my lord the king.
019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be
        put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?
019:022 David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah,
        that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there
        any man be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know
        that I am this day king over Israel?
019:023 The king said to Shimei, You shall not die.  The king
        swore to him.
019:024 Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king;
        and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard,
        nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until
        the day he came home in peace.
019:025 It happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
        that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?
019:026 He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me:
        for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may
        ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.
019:027 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord
        the king is as an angel of God:  do therefore what is good
        in your eyes.
019:028 For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king;
        yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table.
        What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more
        to the king?
019:029 The king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters?
        I say, You and Ziba divide the land.
019:030 Mephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all,
        because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.
019:031 Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went
        over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old:
        and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay
        at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
019:033 The king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I
        will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.
019:034 Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years
        of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
019:035 I am this day eighty years old:  can I discern between good
        and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
        can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
        women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my
        lord the king?
019:036 Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
019:037 Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die
        in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother.
        But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord
        the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.
019:038 The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me,
        and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you:
        and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
019:039 All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over:
        and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned
        to his own place.
019:040 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him:
        and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half
        the people of Israel.
019:041 Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king,
        Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away,
        and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan,
        and all David's men with him?
019:042 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king
        is a close relative to us:  why then are you angry for this
        matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or has
        he given us any gift?
019:043 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
        We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right]
        in David than you:  why then did you despise us, that our
        advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?
        The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words
        of the men of Israel.
020:001 There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba,
        the son of Bichri, a Benjamite:  and he blew the trumpet,
        and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance
        in the son of Jesse:  every man to his tents, Israel.
020:002 So all the men of Israel went up from following David,
        and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah
        joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
020:003 David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
        women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house,
        and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance,
        but didn't go in to them.  So they were shut up to the day
        of their death, living in widowhood.
020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together
        within three days, and be here present.
020:005 So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
020:006 David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us
        more harm than did Absalom:  take your lord's servants,
        and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities,
        and escape out of our sight.
020:007 There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went
        out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came
        to meet them.  Joab was girded with his apparel of war that
        he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened
        on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
020:009 Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother?
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels
        to the ground, and didn't strike him again; and he died.
        Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:011 There stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who
        favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.
020:012 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway.
        When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa
        out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him,
        when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
        on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:014 He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah,
        and all the Berites:  and they were gathered together,
        and went also after him.
020:015 They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast
        up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart;
        and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall,
        to throw it down.
020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear!
        Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
020:017 He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab?  He answered,
        I am.  Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid.
        He answered, I do hear.
020:018 Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in
        old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel:
        and so they ended [the matter].
020:019 I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
        why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?
020:020 Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should
        swallow up or destroy.
020:021 The matter is not so:  but a man of the hill country
        of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted
        up his hand against the king, even against David;
        deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.
        The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown
        to you over the wall.
020:022 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom.
        They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri,
        and threw it out to Joab.  He blew the trumpet, and they
        were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent.
        Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
020:023 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
020:024 and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor;
        and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
020:025 and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
020:026 and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
021:001 There was a famine in the days of David three years,
        year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh.
        Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house,
        because he put to death the Gibeonites.
021:002 The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites
        were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of
        the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them:
        and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children
        of Israel and Judah);
021:003 and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
        And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless
        the inheritance of Yahweh?
021:004 The Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold
        between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put
        any man to death in Israel.  He said, What you shall say,
        that will I do for you.
021:005 They said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised
        against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the borders of Israel,
021:006 let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang
        them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.
        The king said, I will give them.
021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel
        the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
021:009 He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
        hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell [all]
        seven together.  They were put to death in the days of harvest,
        in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
021:010 Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
        was poured on them from the sky; and she allowed neither
        the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals
        of the field by night.
021:011 It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
        of Saul, had done.
021:012 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
        his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from
        the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them,
        in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;
021:013 and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son:  and they gathered the bones of those
        who were hanged.
021:014 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country
        of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father:
        and they performed all that the king commanded.
        After that God was entreated for the land.
021:015 The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down,
        and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines.
        David grew faint;
021:016 and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight,
        he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.
021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck
        the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David swore
        to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle,
        that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.
021:018 It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the
        Philistines at Gob:  then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph,
        who was of the sons of the giant.
021:019 There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan
        the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath
        the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like
        a weaver's beam.
021:020 There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
        who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes,
        four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
021:021 When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother,
        killed him.
021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell
        by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
022:001 David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day
        that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,
        and out of the hand of Saul:
022:002 and he said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
        even mine;
022:003 God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield,
        and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge.
        My savior, you save me from violence.
022:004 I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
        So shall I be saved from my enemies.
022:005 For the waves of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
        made me afraid.
022:006 The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death caught me.
022:007 In my distress I called on Yahweh.  Yes, I called to my God.
        He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry [came] into his ears.
022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations of heaven
        quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
022:009 Smoke went up out of his nostrils.  Fire out of his mouth devoured.
        Coals were kindled by it.
022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
        was under his feet.
022:011 He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he was seen on the wings
        of the wind.
022:012 He made darkness pavilions around himself:  gathering of waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.
022:013 At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.
022:014 Yahweh thundered from heaven.  The Most High uttered his voice.
022:015 He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
022:016 Then the channels of the sea appeared.  The foundations of
        the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast
        of the breath of his nostrils.
022:017 He sent from on high and he took me.  He drew me out
        of many waters.
022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me,
        for they were too mighty for me.
022:019 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
        was my support.
022:020 He also brought me out into a large place.  He delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.
022:021 Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
        He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
022:022 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.
022:023 For all his ordinances were before me.  As for his statutes,
        I did not depart from them.
022:024 I was also perfect toward him.  I kept myself from my iniquity.
022:025 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
        According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
022:026 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
        With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.
022:027 With the pure you will show yourself pure.  With the crooked
        you will show yourself shrewd.
022:028 You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on
        the haughty, that you may bring them down.
022:029 For you are my lamp, Yahweh.  Yahweh will light up my darkness.
022:030 For by you, I run against a troop.  By my God, I leap over a wall.
022:031 As for God, his way is perfect.  The word of Yahweh is tested.
        He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
022:032 For who is God, besides Yahweh?  Who is a rock, besides our God?
022:033 God is my strong fortress.  He makes my way perfect.
022:034 He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], and sets me on
        my high places.
022:035 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
022:036 You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
        Your gentleness has made me great.
022:037 You have enlarged my steps under me.  My feet have not slipped.
022:038 I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.  I didn't turn
        again until they were consumed.
022:039 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they
        can't arise.  Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
022:040 For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
        You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
022:041 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
        might cut off those who hate me.
022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh,
        but he didn't answer them.
022:043 Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
        I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
022:044 You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
        You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
        A people whom I have not known will serve me.
022:045 The foreigners will submit themselves to me.  As soon as they
        hear of me, they will obey me.
022:046 The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out
        of their close places.
022:047 Yahweh lives!  Blessed be my rock!  Exalted be God, the rock
        of my salvation,
022:048 even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down
        peoples under me,
022:049 who brings me away from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up
        above those who rise up against me.  You deliver me from
        the violent man.
022:050 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
        Will sing praises to your name.
022:051 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness
        to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.
023:001 Now these are the last words of David.  David the son of Jesse says,
        the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God
        of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:
023:002 The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me.  His word was on my tongue.
023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
        one who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,
023:004 [He shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,
        a morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs]
        out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.
023:005 Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made
        with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things,
        and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire,
        although he doesn't make it grow.
023:006 But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,
        because they can't be taken with the hand,
023:007 But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and
        the staff of a spear.  They shall be utterly burned with fire
        in [their] place.
023:008 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:
        Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains;
        the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain
        at one time.
023:009 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite,
        one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied
        the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle,
        and the men of Israel were gone away.
023:010 He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary,
        and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great
        victory that day; and the people returned after him only
        to take spoil.
023:011 After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite.
        The Philistines were gathered together into a troop,
        where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people
        fled from the Philistines.
023:012 But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it,
        and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.
023:013 Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David
        in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop
        of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
023:014 David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
023:015 David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink
        of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
023:016 The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines,
        and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was
        by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
        but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.
023:017 He said, Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this:
        [shall I drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy
        of their lives? therefore he would not drink it.
        These things did the three mighty men.
023:018 Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
        of the three.  He lifted up his spear against three hundred
        and killed them, and had a name among the three.
023:019 Wasn't he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made
        their captain:  however he didn't attain to the [first] three.
023:020 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
        who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel
        of Moab:  he went down also and killed a lion in the midst
        of a pit in time of snow.
023:021 He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man:  and the Egyptian had
        a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff,
        and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son
        of Dodo of Bethlehem,
023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
023:027 Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai
        of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
023:030 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam
        the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
023:035 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers
        to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
023:038 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
023:039 Uriah the Hittite:  thirty-seven in all.
024:001 Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved
        David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
024:002 The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him,
        Go now back and forth through all the tribes of Israel,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people,
        that I may know the sum of the people.
024:003 Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh your God add to the people,
        however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes
        of my lord the king see it:  but why does my lord the king
        delight in this thing?
024:004 Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab,
        and against the captains of the army.  Joab and the captains
        of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number
        the people of Israel.
024:005 They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right
        side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad,
        and to Jazer:
024:006 then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi;
        and they came to Dan Jaan, and round about to Sidon,
024:007 and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities
        of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out
        to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
024:008 So when they had gone back and forth through all the land,
        they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
024:009 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king:
        and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.
024:010 David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people.
        David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I
        have done:  but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity
        of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
024:011 When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came
        to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
024:012 Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things:
        choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven
        years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee
        three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall
        there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you,
        and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
024:014 David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let us fall
        now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great;
        and let me not fall into the hand of man.
024:015 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even
        to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan
        even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
024:016 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem
        to destroy it, Yahweh repented him of the evil, and said
        to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough;
        now stay your hand.  The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing
        floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:017 David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people,
        and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely;
        but these sheep, what have they done?  Please let your hand
        be against me, and against my father's house.
024:018 Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar
        to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:019 David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
024:020 Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him:  and Araunah went out, and bowed himself
        before the king with his face to the ground.
024:021 Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?
        David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar
        to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
024:022 Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
        what seems good to him:  behold, the oxen for the burnt offering,
        and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen
        for the wood:
024:023 all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.  Araunah said
        to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.
024:024 The king said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly
        buy it of you at a price.  Neither will I offer burnt
        offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.
        So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty
        shekels of silver.
024:025 David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings.  So Yahweh was entreated for the land,
        and the plague was stayed from Israel.
Book 11 1 Kings
001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he got no heat.
001:002 Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin:  and let her stand before
        the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom,
        that my lord the king may keep warm.
001:003 So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all
        the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite,
        and brought her to the king.
001:004 The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king,
        and ministered to him; but the king didn't know her intimately.
001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying,
        I will be king:  and he prepared him chariots and horsemen,
        and fifty men to run before him.
001:006 His father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why have you done so? and he was also a very goodly man;
        and he was born after Absalom.
001:007 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
        the priest:  and they following Adonijah helped him.
001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty
        men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
001:009 Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all
        his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah,
        the king's servants:
001:010 but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men,
        and Solomon his brother, he didn't call.
001:011 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
        Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns,
        and David our lord doesn't know it?
001:012 Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you
        may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
001:013 Go and get you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you,
        my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon
        your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
        why then does Adonijah reign?
001:014 Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will
        come in after you, and confirm your words.
001:015 Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber:  and the king
        was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering
        to the king.
001:016 Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king.  The king said,
        What would you?
001:017 She said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God
        to your handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon your son shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
001:018 Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king,
        don't know it:
001:019 and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
        and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest,
        and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called
        Solomon your servant.
001:020 You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you,
        that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him.
001:021 Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall
        be counted offenders.
001:022 Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet came in.
001:023 They told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet.
        When he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.
001:024 Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, Adonijah shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
001:025 For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings
        and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons,
        and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest;
        and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,
        [Long] live king Adonijah.
001:026 But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest,
        and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.
001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown
        to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord
        the king after him?
001:028 Then king David answered, Call to me Bathsheba.
        She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
001:029 The king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed
        my soul out of all adversity,
001:030 most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me,
        and he shall sit on my throne in my place; most certainly
        so will I do this day.
001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance
        to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.
001:032 King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.  They came
        before the king.
001:033 The king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
        and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring
        him down to Gihon:
001:034 and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel; and blow you the trumpet, and say,
        [Long] live king Solomon.
001:035 Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit
        on my throne; for he shall be king in my place; and I have
        appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
001:036 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,
        and said, Amen:  Yahweh, the God of my lord the king,
        say so [too].
001:037 As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be
        he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne
        of my lord king David.
001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites,
        went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule,
        and brought him to Gihon.
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
001:044 and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused
        him to ride on the king's mule;
001:045 and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
        king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing,
        so that the city rang again.  This is the noise that
        you have heard.
001:046 Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
001:047 Moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord
        king David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon better
        than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne:
        and the king bowed himself on the bed.
001:048 Also thus said the king, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes
        even seeing it.
001:049 All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went
        every man his way.
001:050 Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went,
        and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
001:051 It was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon;
        for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar,
        saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not
        kill his servant with the sword.
001:052 Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall
        not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found
        in him, he shall die.
001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
        He came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said
        to him, Go to your house.
002:001 Now the days of David drew near that he should die;
        and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
002:002 I am going the way of all the earth:  be you strong therefore,
        and show yourself a man;
002:003 and keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways,
        to keep his statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances,
        and his testimonies, according to that which is written
        in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do,
        and wherever you turn yourself.
002:004 That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me,
        saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk
        before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
        there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
002:005 Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
        even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel,
        to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether,
        whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put
        the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist,
        and in his shoes that were on his feet.
002:006 Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let his gray
        head go down to Sheol in peace.
002:007 But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
        and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they
        came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
002:008 Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
        of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I
        went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan,
        and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, I will not put you
        to death with the sword.
002:009 Now therefore don't hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man;
        and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall
        bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.
002:010 David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
002:011 The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years;
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty-three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.
002:012 Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
        was established greatly.
002:013 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba
        the mother of Solomon.  She said, Come you peaceably?
        He said, Peaceably.
002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to tell you.
        She said, Say on.
002:015 He said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all
        Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign:
        however the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's;
        for it was his from Yahweh.
002:016 Now I ask one petition of you; don't deny me.  She said
        to him, Say on.
002:017 He said, "Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell
        you 'no'), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife."
002:018 Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.
002:019 Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him
        for Adonijah.  The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself
        to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be
        set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
002:020 Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; don't deny me.
        The king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.
002:021 She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
        your brother as wife.
002:022 King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag
        the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also;
        for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
        the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
002:023 Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me,
        and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against
        his own life.
002:024 Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me,
        and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made
        me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put
        to death this day.
002:025 King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell
        on him, so that he died.
002:026 To Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth,
        to your own fields; for you are worthy of death:
        but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bear
        the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because
        you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.
002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh,
        that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke
        concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
002:028 The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
        though he didn't turn after Absalom.  Joab fled to the Tent
        of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
002:029 It was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh,
        and behold, he is by the altar.  Then Solomon sent Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.
002:030 Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says
        the king, Come forth.  He said, No; but I will die here.
        Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,
        and thus he answered me.
002:031 The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him,
        and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab
        shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.
002:032 Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell
        on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed
        them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it,
        [to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel,
        and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.
002:033 So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on
        the head of his seed forever:  but to David, and to his seed,
        and to his house, and to his throne, shall there be peace
        for ever from Yahweh.
002:034 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him,
        and killed him; and he was buried in his own house
        in the wilderness.
002:035 The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army;
        and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
002:036 The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him,
        Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there,
        and don't go forth from there any where.
002:037 For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron,
        know you for certain that you shall surely die:
        your blood shall be on your own head.
002:038 Shimei said to the king, The saying is good:
        as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.
        Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
002:039 It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants
        of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath.
        They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.
002:040 Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish,
        to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his
        servants from Gath.
002:041 It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
        and was come again.
002:042 The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Didn't I
        adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain,
        that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where,
        you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I
        have heard is good.
002:043 Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment
        that I have charged you with?
002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness
        which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father:
        therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.
002:045 But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
        shall be established before Yahweh forever.
002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
        and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died.
        The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
003:001 Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
        Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
        until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house
        of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
003:002 Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there
        was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.
003:003 Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father:
        only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
003:004 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
        the great high place:  a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
        offer on that altar.
003:005 In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night;
        and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
003:006 Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father
        great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth,
        and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you;
        and you have kept for him this great loving kindness,
        that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it
        is this day.
003:007 Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead
        of David my father:  and I am but a little child; I don't
        know how to go out or come in.
003:008 Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen,
        a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.
003:009 Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge
        your people, that I may discern between good and evil;
        for who is able to judge this your great people?
003:010 The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
003:011 God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have
        not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches
        for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies,
        but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;
003:012 behold, I have done according to your word:  behold, I have
        given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there
        has been none like you before you, neither after you shall
        any arise like you.
003:013 I have also given you that which you have not asked,
        both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among
        the kings like you, all your days.
003:014 If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments,
        as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.
003:015 Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream:  and he came
        to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings,
        and made a feast to all his servants.
003:016 Then there came two women who were prostitutes, to the king,
        and stood before him.
003:017 The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house;
        and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
003:018 It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this
        woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no
        stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
003:019 This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it.
003:020 She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
        while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom,
        and laid her dead child in my bosom.
003:021 When I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead;
        but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was
        not my son, whom I bore.
003:022 The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead
        is your son.  This said, No; but the dead is your son,
        and the living is my son.  Thus they spoke before the king.
003:023 Then said the king, The one says, This is my son who lives,
        and your son is the dead:  and the other says, No; but your
        son is the dead, and my son is the living.
003:024 The king said, Get me a sword.  They brought a sword
        before the king.
003:025 The king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
        to the one, and half to the other.
003:026 Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king,
        for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord,
        give her the living child, and in no way kill it.
        But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.
003:027 Then the king answered, Give her the living child, and in no
        way kill it:  she is the mother of it.
003:028 All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
        and they feared the king:  for they saw that the wisdom of God
        was in him, to do justice.
004:001 King Solomon was king over all Israel.
004:002 These were the princes whom he had:  Azariah the son
        of Zadok, the priest;
004:003 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the
        son of Ahilud, the recorder;
004:004 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok
        and Abiathar were priests;
004:005 and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud
        the son of Nathan was chief minister, [and] the king's friend;
004:006 and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son
        of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor.
004:007 Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided
        food for the king and his household:  each man had to make
        provision for a month in the year.
004:008 These are their names:  Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
004:009 Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh,
        and Elon Beth Hanan;
004:010 Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him [pertained] Socoh, and all
        the land of Hepher);
004:011 Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath
        the daughter of Solomon as wife);
004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all
        Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel,
        from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
004:013 Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him [pertained] the towns
        of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; [even] to
        him [pertained] the region of Argob, which is in Bashan,
        sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
004:015 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter
        of Solomon as wife);
004:016 Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
004:018 Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
004:019 Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country
        of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan;
        and [he was] the only officer who was in the land.
004:020 Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea
        in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
004:021 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to
        the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt:
        they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days
        of his life.
004:022 Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour,
        and sixty measures of meal,
004:023 ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and one
        hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks,
        and fattened fowl.
004:024 For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River,
        from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side
        the River:  and he had peace on all sides round about him.
004:025 Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine
        and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        all the days of Solomon.
004:026 Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
        and twelve thousand horsemen.
004:027 Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all
        who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month;
        they let nothing be lacking.
004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought
        they to the place where [the officers] were, every man
        according to his charge.
004:029 God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
        and very great understanding, even as the sand that is
        on the seashore.
004:030 Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
        of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite,
        and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
        and his fame was in all the nations round about.
004:032 He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were
        one thousand five.
004:033 He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to
        the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals,
        and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
004:034 There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
005:001 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard
        that they had anointed him king in the room of his father:
        for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
005:002 Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
005:003 You know how that David my father could not build a house
        for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about
        him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles
        of his feet.
005:004 But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side;
        there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
005:005 Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh
        my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, Your son,
        whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build
        the house for my name.
005:006 Now therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
        and my servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you
        hire for your servants according to all that you shall say:
        for you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut
        timber like the Sidonians.
005:007 It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
        that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Yahweh this day,
        who has given to David a wise son over this great people.
005:008 Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard [the message]
        which you have sent to me:  I will do all your desire concerning
        timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea;
        and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you
        shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there,
        and you shall receive them; and you shall accomplish my desire,
        in giving food for my household.
005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir
        according to all his desire.
005:011 Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
        food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil:
        thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
005:012 Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there
        was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made
        a league together.
005:013 King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
        was thirty thousand men.
005:014 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses;
        a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home;
        and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.
005:015 Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty
        thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;
005:016 besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work,
        three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people
        who labored in the work.
005:017 The king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones,
        to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.
005:018 Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites
        did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones
        to build the house.
006:001 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after
        the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
        in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel,
        in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began
        to build the house of Yahweh.
006:002 The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, the length of it
        was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty [cubits],
        and the height of it thirty cubits.
006:003 The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
        the length of it, according to the breadth of the house;
        [and] ten cubits was the breadth of it before the house.
006:004 For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.
006:005 Against the wall of the house he built stories round about,
        against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple
        and of the oracle; and he made side chambers round about.
006:006 The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle
        was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad;
        for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house
        round about, that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls
        of the house.
006:007 The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
        ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor
        any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
006:008 The door for the middle side chambers was in the right side
        of the house:  and they went up by winding stairs into
        the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.
006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house
        with beams and planks of cedar.
006:010 He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high:
        and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
006:011 The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,
006:012 Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk
        in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my
        commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word
        with you, which I spoke to David your father.
006:013 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
        my people Israel.
006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
006:015 He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar:
        from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling,
        he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered
        the floor of the house with boards of fir.
006:016 He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house
        with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls [of
        the ceiling]: he built [them] for it within, for an oracle,
        even for the most holy place.
006:017 The house, that is, the temple before [the oracle],
        was forty cubits [long].
006:018 There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and
        open flowers:  all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
006:019 He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within,
        to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
006:020 Within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length,
        and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in
        the height of it; and he overlaid it with pure gold:
        and he covered the altar with cedar.
006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold:
        and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle;
        and he overlaid it with gold.
006:022 The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house
        was finished:  also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle
        he overlaid with gold.
006:023 In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood,
        each ten cubits high.
006:024 Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
        the other wing of the cherub:  from the uttermost part of the one
        wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
006:025 The other cherub was ten cubits:  both the cherubim were of one
        measure and one form.
006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it
        of the other cherub.
006:027 He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings
        of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing
        of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
        cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
        another in the midst of the house.
006:028 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
006:029 He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
        figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers,
        inside and outside.
006:030 The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.
006:031 For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood:
        the lintel [and] door posts were a fifth part [of the wall].
006:032 So [he made] two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them
        carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
        them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim,
        and on the palm trees.
006:033 So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts
        of olive wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];
006:034 and two doors of fir wood:  the two leaves of the one door
        were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
006:035 He carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers;
        and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.
006:036 He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone,
        and a course of cedar beams.
006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid,
        in the month Ziv.
006:038 In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month,
        was the house finished throughout all the parts of it,
        and according to all the fashion of it.  So was he seven
        years in building it.
007:001 Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
        all his house.
007:002 For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it
        was one hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits,
        and the height of it thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars,
        with cedar beams on the pillars.
007:003 It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams,
        that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.
007:004 There were beams in three rows, and window was over against
        window in three ranks.
007:005 All the doors and posts were made square with beams:
        and window was over against window in three ranks.
007:006 He made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits,
        and the breadth of it thirty cubits; and a porch before them;
        and pillars and a threshold before them.
007:007 He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge,
        even the porch of judgment:  and it was covered with cedar
        from floor to floor.
007:008 His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch,
        was of the like work.  He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter
        (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.
007:009 All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone,
        according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside,
        even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside
        to the great court.
007:010 The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
        stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
007:011 Above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure,
        and cedar wood.
007:012 The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone,
        and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house
        of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.
007:013 King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
007:014 He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
        was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with
        wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass.
        He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.
007:015 For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits
        high apiece:  and a line of twelve cubits compassed either
        of them about.
007:016 He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of
        the pillars:  the height of the one capital was five cubits,
        and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
007:017 There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work,
        for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
        seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
007:018 So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about on
        the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top
        of the pillars:  and so did he for the other capital.
007:019 The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch
        were of lily work, four cubits.
007:020 There were capitals above also on the two pillars,
        close by the belly which was beside the network:
        and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about
        on the other capital.
007:021 He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple:
        and he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin;
        and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.
007:022 On the top of the pillars was lily work:  so was the work
        of the pillars finished.
007:023 He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits;
        and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
007:024 Under the brim of it round about there were buds which did
        compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about:
        the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
007:025 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
        and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward
        the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was
        set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
007:026 It was a handbreadth thick:  and the brim of it was worked
        like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily:
        it held two thousand baths.
007:027 He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length
        of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits
        the height of it.
007:028 The work of the bases was on this manner:  they had panels;
        and there were panels between the ledges;
007:029 and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen,
        and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above;
        and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
007:030 Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass;
        and the four feet of it had supports:  beneath the basin
        were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
007:031 The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit:
        and the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal,
        a cubit and a half; and also on the mouth of it were engravings,
        and their panels were foursquare, not round.
007:032 The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles
        of the wheels were in the base:  and the height of a wheel
        was a cubit and half a cubit.
007:033 The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
        their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves,
        were all molten.
007:034 There were four supports at the four corners of each base:
        the supports of it were of the base itself.
007:035 In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high;
        and on the top of the base the stays of it and the panels
        of it were of the same.
007:036 On the plates of the stays of it, and on the panels of it,
        he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to
        the space of each, with wreaths round about.
007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases:  all of them had
        one casting, one measure, and one form.
007:038 He made ten basins of brass:  one basin contained forty baths;
        and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten
        bases one basin.
007:039 He set the bases, five on the right side of the house,
        and five on the left side of the house:  and he set the sea
        on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
007:040 Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins.
        So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked
        for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh:
007:041 the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on
        the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
007:042 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks;
        two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
007:043 and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;
007:044 and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
007:045 and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins:
        even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon,
        in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished brass.
007:046 In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
007:047 Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were
        exceeding many:  the weight of the brass could not be found out.
007:048 Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh:
        the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show
        bread was, of gold;
007:049 and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left,
        before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps,
        and the tongs, of gold;
007:050 and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons,
        and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for
        the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for
        the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.
007:051 Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house
        of Yahweh was finished.  Solomon brought in the things
        which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver,
        and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries
        of the house of Yahweh.
008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the
        children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David,
        which is Zion.
008:002 All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at
        the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
008:003 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
008:004 They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting,
        and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did
        the priests and the Levites bring up.
008:005 King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled
        to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen,
        that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
008:006 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to
        its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,
        even under the wings of the cherubim.
008:007 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles
        of it above.
008:008 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from
        the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside:
        and there they are to this day.
008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone
        which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant
        with the children of Israel, when they came out of the
        land of Egypt.
008:010 It came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place,
        that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,
008:011 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
        the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.
008:012 Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell
        in the thick darkness.
008:013 I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you
        to dwell in forever.
008:014 The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly
        of Israel:  and all the assembly of Israel stood.
008:015 He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke
        with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand
        fulfilled it, saying,
008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out
        of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel
        to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose
        David to be over my people Israel.
008:017 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
        for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
008:018 But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your
        heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it
        was in your heart:
008:019 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who
        shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house
        for my name.
008:020 Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I am risen up
        in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel,
        as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
008:021 There have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant
        of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought
        them out of the land of Egypt.
008:022 Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all
        the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
008:023 and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you,
        in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant
        and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you
        with all their heart;
008:024 who have kept with your servant David my father that which you
        did promise him:  yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have
        fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
008:025 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
        David my father that which you have promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne
        of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way,
        to walk before me as you have walked before me.
008:026 Now therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified,
        which you spoke to your servant David my father.
008:027 But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold,
        heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you;
        how much less this house that I have built!
008:028 Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for
        his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to
        the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;
008:029 that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
        even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall
        be there; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall
        pray toward this place.
008:030 Listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your
        people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place:
        yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when
        you hear, forgive.
008:031 If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him
        to cause him to swear, and he come [and] swear before your
        altar in this house;
008:032 then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants,
        condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head,
        and justifying the righteous, to give him according
        to his righteousness.
008:033 When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you,
        and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you
        in this house:
008:034 then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel,
        and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.
008:035 When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place,
        and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you
        do afflict them:
008:036 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants,
        and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way
        in which they should walk; and send rain on your land,
        which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        if there is blight [or] mildew, locust [or] caterpillar;
        if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities;
        whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;
008:038 whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man,
        [or] by all your people Israel, who shall know every man
        the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands
        toward this house:
008:039 then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive,
        and do, and render to every man according to all his ways,
        whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts
        of all the children of men;)
008:040 that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land
        which you gave to our fathers.
008:041 Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel,
        when he shall come out of a far country for your name's sake
008:042 (for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand,
        and of your outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray
        toward this house;
008:043 hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all
        that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples
        of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as does your
        people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I
        have built is called by my name.
008:044 If your people go out to battle against their enemy,
        by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh
        toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house
        which I have built for your name;
008:045 then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.
008:046 If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin),
        and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy,
        so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy,
        far off or near;
008:047 yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they
        are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication
        to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying,
        We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
008:048 if they return to you with all their heart and with all their
        soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive,
        and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers,
        the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have
        built for your name:
008:049 then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven,
        your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;
008:050 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their
        transgressions in which they have transgressed against you;
        and give them compassion before those who carried them captive,
        that they may have compassion on them
008:051 (for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought
        forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
008:052 that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant,
        and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen
        to them whenever they cry to you.
008:053 For you did separate them from among all the peoples of the earth,
        to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant,
        when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.
008:054 It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
        this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before
        the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands
        spread forth toward heaven.
008:055 He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a
        loud voice, saying,
008:056 Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel,
        according to all that he promised:  there has not failed
        one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
        Moses his servant.
008:057 Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers:
        let him not leave us, nor forsake us;
008:058 that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways,
        and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances,
        which he commanded our fathers.
008:059 Let these my words, with which I have made supplication
        before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night,
        that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause
        of his people Israel, as every day shall require;
008:060 that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God;
        there is none else.
008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God,
        to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments,
        as at this day.
008:062 The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
008:063 Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings,
        which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand oxen,
        and one hundred twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all
        the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.
008:064 The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy
        that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered
        the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat
        of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was
        before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering,
        and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.
008:065 So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him,
        a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook
        of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days,
        even fourteen days.
008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed
        the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart
        for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant,
        and to Israel his people.
009:001 It happened, when Solomon had finished the building of the house
        of Yahweh, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire
        which he was pleased to do,
009:002 that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
        appeared to him at Gibeon.
009:003 Yahweh said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication,
        that you have made before me:  I have made this house holy,
        which you have built, to put my name there forever;
        and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
009:004 As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked,
        in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according
        to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes
        and my ordinances;
009:005 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever,
        according as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall
        not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.
009:006 But if you shall turn away from following me, you or your children,
        and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I
        have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods,
        and worship them;
009:007 then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;
        and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast
        out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword
        among all peoples.
009:008 Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes
        by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say,
        Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
009:009 and they shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God,
        who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
        and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them:
        therefore has Yahweh brought all this evil on them.
009:010 It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had
        built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the king's house
009:011 (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
        trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all
        his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities
        in the land of Galilee.
009:012 Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
        given him; and they didn't please him.
009:013 He said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?
        He called them the land of Cabul to this day.
009:014 Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.
009:015 This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised,
        to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo,
        and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
009:016 Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
        it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city,
        and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
009:017 Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,
009:018 and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
009:019 and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities
        for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that
        which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem,
        and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
009:020 As for all the people who were left of the Amorites,
        the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
        who were not of the children of Israel;
009:021 their children who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy,
        of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants to this day.
009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants;
        but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes,
        and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
009:023 These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work,
        five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored
        in the work.
009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David
        to her house which [Solomon] had built for her:
        then did he build Millo.
009:025 Three times a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
        and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh,
        burning incense therewith, [on the altar] that was before Yahweh.
        So he finished the house.
009:026 King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is
        beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        in the land of Edom.
009:027 Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge
        of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
009:028 They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred
        and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
010:001 When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
        the name of Yahweh, she came to prove him with hard questions.
010:002 She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
        that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones;
        and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all
        that was in her heart.
010:003 Solomon told her all her questions:  there was not anything
        hidden from the king which he didn't tell her.
010:004 When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,
010:005 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing,
        and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up
        to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.
010:006 She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my
        own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.
010:007 However I didn't believe the words, until I came, and my
        eyes had seen it:  and behold, the half was not told me;
        your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
010:008 Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand
        continually before you, [and] who hear your wisdom.
010:009 Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you
        on the throne of Israel:  because Yahweh loved Israel forever,
        therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.
010:010 She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices very great store, and precious stones:
        there came no more such abundance of spices as these which
        the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
010:011 The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
        from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.
010:012 The king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh,
        and for the king's house, harps also and stringed instruments
        for the singers:  there came no such almug trees, nor were seen,
        to this day.
010:013 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of
        his royal bounty.  So she turned, and went to her own land,
        she and her servants.
010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
        hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
010:015 besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic
        of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people,
        and of the governors of the country.
010:016 King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold;
        six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.
010:017 [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas
        of gold went to one shield:  and the king put them in the house
        of the forest of Lebanon.
010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with the finest gold.
010:019 There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was
        round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place
        of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
010:020 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on
        the six steps:  there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.
010:021 All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
        of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold:
        none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the
        days of Solomon.
010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram:
        once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold,
        and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches
        and in wisdom.
010:024 All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom,
        which God had put in his heart.
010:025 They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels
        of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules,
        a rate year by year.
010:026 Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen:
        and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve
        thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities,
        and with the king at Jerusalem.
010:027 The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,
        and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are
        in the lowland, for abundance.
010:028 The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt;
        and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove
        at a price.
010:029 A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
        [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty;
        and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings
        of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
011:001 Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter
        of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians,
        and Hittites;
011:002 of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children
        of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they
        come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart
        after their gods:  Solomon joined to these in love.
011:003 He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines;
        and his wives turned away his heart.
011:004 For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
        away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect
        with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.
011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians,
        and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
011:006 Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
        and didn't go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.
011:007 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination
        of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for
        Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
011:008 So did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and
        sacrificed to their gods.
011:009 Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away
        from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
011:010 and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
        after other gods:  but he didn't keep that which Yahweh commanded.
011:011 Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you,
        and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I
        have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you,
        and will give it to your servant.
011:012 Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David
        your father's sake:  but I will tear it out of the hand
        of your son.
011:013 However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will
        give one tribe to your son, for David my servant's sake,
        and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
011:014 Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
        he was of the king's seed in Edom.
011:015 For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain
        of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck
        every male in Edom
011:016 (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had
        cut off every male in Edom);
011:017 that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
        with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
011:018 They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men
        with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh
        king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food,
        and gave him land.
011:019 Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
        he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister
        of Tahpenes the queen.
011:020 The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
        weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's
        house among the sons of Pharaoh.
011:021 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
        and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said
        to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
011:022 Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me,
        that behold, you seek to go to your own country?
        He answered, Nothing:  however only let me depart.
011:023 God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada,
        who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
011:024 He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop,
        when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus,
        and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.
011:025 He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
        besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel,
        and reigned over Syria.
011:026 Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah,
        a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow,
        he also lifted up his hand against the king.
011:027 This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king:
        Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city
        of David his father.
011:028 The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw
        the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge
        over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
011:029 It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
        that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
        now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they
        two were alone in the field.
011:030 Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore
        it in twelve pieces.
011:031 He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of
        the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you
011:032 (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake
        and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out
        of all the tribes of Israel);
011:033 because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped
        Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god
        of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon;
        and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right
        in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances,
        as did David his father.
011:034 However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand;
        but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David
        my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments
        and my statutes;
011:035 but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
        give it to you, even ten tribes.
011:036 To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
        have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I
        have chosen me to put my name there.
011:037 I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your
        soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.
011:038 It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you,
        and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes,
        to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did;
        that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house,
        as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.
011:039 I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.
011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose,
        and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt
        until the death of Solomon.
011:041 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,
        and his wisdom, aren't they written in the book of the
        acts of Solomon?
011:042 The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
        was forty years.
011:043 Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
        of David his father:  and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
012:001 Rehoboam went to Shechem:  for all Israel were come to Shechem
        to make him king.
012:002 It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it
        (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence
        of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,
012:003 and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly
        of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
012:004 Your father made our yoke grievous:  now therefore make you
        the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke
        which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
012:005 He said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.
        The people departed.
012:006 King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before
        Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel
        give you me to return answer to this people?
012:007 They spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this
        people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak
        good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.
012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
        and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him,
        who stood before him.
012:009 He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer
        to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        that your father did put on us lighter?
012:010 The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying,
        Thus shall you tell this people who spoke to you, saying,
        Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us;
        thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker
        than my father's waist.
012:011 Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
        I will add to your yoke:  my father chastised you with whips,
        but I will chastise you with scorpions.
012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
012:013 The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel
        of the old men which they had given him,
012:014 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke:
        my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
        you with scorpions.
012:015 So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was a thing
        brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word,
        which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat.
012:016 When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we
        in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        to your tents, Israel:  now see to your own house, David.
        So Israel departed to their tents.
012:017 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities
        of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject
        to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones.
        King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot,
        to flee to Jerusalem.
012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
012:020 It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned,
        that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him
        king over all Israel:  there was none who followed the house
        of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
012:021 When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
        of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty
        thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against
        the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon.
012:022 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
012:023 Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
        and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest
        of the people, saying,
012:024 Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your
        brothers the children of Israel:  return every man to his house;
        for this thing is of me.  So they listened to the word of Yahweh,
        and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.
012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim,
        and lived therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.
012:026 Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return
        to the house of David:
012:027 if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house
        of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people
        turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah;
        and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold;
        and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
        see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the
        land of Egypt.
012:029 He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
012:030 This thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship]
        before the one, even to Dan.
012:031 He made houses of high places, and made priests from among
        all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
012:032 Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
        day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went
        up to the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves
        that he had made:  and he placed in Bethel the priests
        of the high places that he had made.
012:033 He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on
        the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month
        which he had devised of his own heart:  and he ordained
        a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar,
        to burn incense.
013:001 Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
        of Yahweh to Beth El:  and Jeroboam was standing by the altar
        to burn incense.
013:002 He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said,
        altar, altar, thus says Yahweh:  Behold, a son shall be born
        to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall
        he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense
        on you, and men's bones shall they burn on you.
013:003 He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
        which Yahweh has spoken:  Behold, the altar shall be torn,
        and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.
013:004 It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God,
        which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam
        put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.
        His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
        so that he could not draw it back again to him.
013:005 The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
        according to the sign which the man of God had given by
        the word of Yahweh.
013:006 The king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh
        your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.
        The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king's hand was
        restored him again, and became as it was before.
013:007 The king said to the man of God, Come home with me,
        and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
013:008 The man of God said to the king, If you will give me half
        your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat
        bread nor drink water in this place;
013:009 for so was it charged me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall
        eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way
        that you came.
013:010 So he went another way, and didn't return by the way that
        he came to Bethel.
013:011 Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons
        came and told him all the works that the man of God had done
        that day in Bethel:  the words which he had spoken to the king,
        them also they told to their father.
013:012 Their father said to them, Which way did he go?
        Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went,
        who came from Judah.
013:013 He said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey.  So they saddled
        him the donkey; and he rode thereon.
013:014 He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak;
        and he said to him, Are you the man of God who came
        from Judah?  He said, I am.
013:015 Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
013:016 He said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you;
        neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
013:017 for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no
        bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way
        that you came.
013:018 He said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel
        spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Bring him back with
        you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.
        [But] he lied to him.
013:019 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house,
        and drank water.
013:020 It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh
        came to the prophet who brought him back;
013:021 and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying,
        Thus says Yahweh, Because you have been disobedient to the mouth
        of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh
        your God commanded you,
013:022 but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place
        of which he said to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water;
        your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.
013:023 It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk,
        that he saddled for him the donkey, [to wit], for the prophet
        whom he had brought back.
013:024 When he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him:
        and his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it;
        the lion also stood by the body.
013:025 Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way,
        and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it
        in the city where the old prophet lived.
013:026 When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it,
        he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the mouth
        of Yahweh:  therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion,
        which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.
013:027 He spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey.
        They saddled it.
013:028 He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey
        and the lion standing by the body:  the lion had not eaten
        the body, nor torn the donkey.
013:029 The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it
        on the donkey, and brought it back; and he came to the city
        of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
013:030 He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
        [saying], Alas, my brother!
013:031 It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons,
        saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which
        the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against
        the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
        places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely happen.
013:033 After this thing Jeroboam didn't return from his evil way, but made
        again from among all the people priests of the high places:
        whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests
        of the high places.
013:034 This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off,
        and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.
014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
014:002 Jeroboam said to his wife, Please get up and disguise yourself,
        that you not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you
        to Shiloh:  behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke
        concerning me that I should be king over this people.
014:003 Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey,
        and go to him:  he will tell you what shall become of the child.
014:004 Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh,
        and came to the house of Ahijah.  Now Ahijah could not see;
        for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
014:005 Yahweh said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes
        to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick:
        thus and thus shall you tell her; for it will be, when she
        comes in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
014:006 It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
        in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam;
        why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you
        with heavy news.
014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Because I
        exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over
        my people Israel,
014:008 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you;
        and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept
        my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart,
        to do that only which was right in my eyes,
014:009 but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone
        and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me
        to anger, and have cast me behind your back:
014:010 therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam,
        and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall,{or,
        male} him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel,
        and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man
        sweeps away dung, until it be all gone.
014:011 Him who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat;
        and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat:
        for Yahweh has spoken it.
014:012 Arise you therefore, get you to your house:  [and] when your
        feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
014:013 All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only
        of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there
        is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in the house of Jeroboam.
014:014 Moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel,
        who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day:
        but what? even now.
014:015 For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water;
        and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave
        to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,
        because they have made their Asherim, provoking Yahweh to anger.
014:016 He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
        which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.
014:017 Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
        [and] as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
014:018 All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
014:019 The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
        he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel.
014:020 The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
        and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned
        in his place.
014:021 Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was
        forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
        seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen
        out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there:
        and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
014:022 Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they
        provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed,
        above all that their fathers had done.
014:023 For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim,
        on every high hill, and under every green tree;
014:024 and there were also sodomites in the land:  they did according
        to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove
        out before the children of Israel.
014:025 It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
        king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
014:026 and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
        and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all:
        and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
014:027 King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
        and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard,
        who kept the door of the king's house.
014:028 It was so, that as often as the king went into the house
        of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into
        the guard chamber.
014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Judah?
014:030 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
014:031 Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
        the city of David:  and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
        Abijam his son reigned in his place.
015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
        began Abijam to reign over Judah.
015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's name
        was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
015:003 He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
        before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God,
        as the heart of David his father.
015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did Yahweh his God give
        him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him,
        and to establish Jerusalem;
015:005 because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,
        and didn't turn aside from anything that he commanded
        him all the days of his life, except only in the matter
        of Uriah the Hittite.
015:006 Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
        of his life.
015:007 The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Judah?  There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
015:008 Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city
        of David:  and Asa his son reigned in his place.
015:009 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa
        to reign over Judah.
015:010 Forty-one years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
015:011 Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did
        David his father.
015:012 He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
        the idols that his fathers had made.
015:013 Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen,
        because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah;
        and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
015:014 But the high places were not taken away:  nevertheless the heart
        of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days.
015:015 He brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father
        had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated,
        silver, and gold, and vessels.
015:016 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
015:017 Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
        that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa
        king of Judah.
015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left
        in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures
        of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand
        of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad,
        the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria,
        who lived at Damascus, saying,
015:019 [There is] a league between me and you, between my father and
        your father:  behold, I have sent to you a present of silver
        and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel,
        that he may depart from me.
015:020 Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of
        his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all
        the land of Naphtali.
015:021 It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off
        building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.
015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted:
        and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it,
        with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith
        Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
015:023 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might,
        and all that he did, and the cities which he built,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Judah?  But in the time of his old age he was diseased
        in his feet.
015:024 Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
        in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son
        reigned in his place.
015:025 Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
        year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
015:026 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made
        Israel to sin.
015:027 Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
        conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon,
        which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
        were laying siege to Gibbethon.
015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha kill him,
        and reigned in his place.
015:029 It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house
        of Jeroboam:  he didn't leave to Jeroboam any who breathed,
        until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh,
        which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
015:030 for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which
        he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which
        he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.
015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?
015:032 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha
        the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah,
        [and reigned] twenty-four years.
015:034 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made
        Israel to sin.
016:001 The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani
        against Baasha, saying,
016:002 Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over
        my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam,
        and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger
        with their sins;
016:003 behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house;
        and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat.
016:004 Him who dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat;
        and him who dies of his in the field shall the birds of
        the sky eat.
016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did,
        and his might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
016:006 Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah;
        and Elah his son reigned in his place.
016:007 Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
        the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his house,
        both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh,
        to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being
        like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.
016:008 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah began
        Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah,
        [and reigned] two years.
016:009 His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
        against him.  Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk
        in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
016:010 and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him,
        in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned
        in his place.
016:011 It happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
        on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha:
        he didn't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall,{or,
        male} neither of his relatives, nor of his friends.
016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
016:013 for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son,
        which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin,
        to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren't they
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
016:015 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
        reign seven days in Tirzah.  Now the people were encamped
        against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
016:016 The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired,
        and has also struck the king:  therefore all Israel made Omri,
        the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
016:017 Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him,
        and they besieged Tirzah.
016:018 It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
        that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt
        the king's house over him with fire, and died,
016:019 for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam,
        and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?
016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts:
        half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make
        him king; and half followed Omri.
016:022 But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people
        who followed Tibni the son of Ginath:  so Tibni died,
        and Omri reigned.
016:023 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
        to reign over Israel, [and reigned] twelve years:
        six years reigned he in Tirzah.
016:024 He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver;
        and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city
        which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of
        the hill, Samaria.
016:025 Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt
        wickedly above all who were before him.
016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
        that he shown, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria;
        and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
016:029 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab
        the son of Omri to reign over Israel:  and Ahab the son
        of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
016:030 Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh above all that were before him.
016:031 It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
        in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife
        Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians,
        and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
016:032 He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
        which he had built in Samaria.
016:033 Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel
        who were before him.
016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho:  he laid
        the foundation of it with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,
        and set up the gates of it with the loss of his youngest
        son Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke
        by Joshua the son of Nun.
017:001 Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead,
        said to Ahab, As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom
        I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years,
        but according to my word.
017:002 The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
017:003 Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself
        by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
017:004 It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have
        commanded the ravens to feed you there.
017:005 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went
        and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
017:006 The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
        and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
017:007 It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there
        was no rain in the land.
017:008 The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
017:009 Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon,
        and dwell there:  behold, I have commanded a widow there
        to sustain you.
017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate
        of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks:
        and he called to her, and said, Please get me a little water
        in a vessel, that I may drink.
017:011 As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said,
        Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
017:012 She said, As Yahweh your God lives, I don't have a cake,
        but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar:
        and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake
        it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
017:013 Elijah said to her, Don't be afraid; go and do as you have said;
        but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it forth to me,
        and afterward make for you and for your son.
017:014 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall
        not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day
        that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.
017:015 She went and did according to the saying of Elijah:
        and she, and he, and her house, ate [many] days.
017:016 The jar of meal didn't empty, neither did the jar of oil fail,
        according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah.
017:017 It happened after these things, that the son of the woman,
        the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was
        so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
017:018 She said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, you man
        of God?  You have come to me to bring my sin to memory,
        and to kill my son!
017:019 He said to her, Give me your son.  He took him out of her bosom,
        and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode,
        and laid him on his own bed.
017:020 He cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, have you also brought
        evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?
017:021 He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh,
        and said, Yahweh my God, please let this child's soul come
        into him again.
017:022 Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child
        came into him again, and he revived.
017:023 Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
        chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother;
        and Elijah said, Behold, your son lives.
017:024 The woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God,
        and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.
018:001 It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came
        to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab;
        and I will send rain on the earth.
018:002 Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.  The famine was
        sore in Samaria.
018:003 Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.
        (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:
018:004 for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh,
        that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
        in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
018:005 Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs
        of water, and to all the brooks:  peradventure we may find
        grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose
        all the animals.
018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
        Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another
        way by himself.
018:007 As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him:
        and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you,
        my lord Elijah?
018:008 He answered him, It is I:  go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is
        here].
018:009 He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your
        servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
018:010 As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom,
        where my lord has not sent to seek you:  and when they said,
        He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation,
        that they didn't find you.
018:011 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].
018:012 It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit
        of Yahweh will carry you I don't know where; and so when I
        come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me:
        but I your servant fear Yahweh from my youth.
018:013 Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets
        of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh's prophets
        by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
018:014 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here];
        and he will kill me.
018:015 Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
        I will surely show myself to him today.
018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went
        to meet Elijah.
018:017 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,
        Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
018:018 He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your
        father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments
        of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel,
        and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets
        of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
018:020 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered
        the prophets together to Mount Carmel.
018:021 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you
        waver between the two sides?  If Yahweh is God, follow him;
        but if Baal, then follow him."  The people answered him
        not a word.
018:022 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet
        of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men.
018:023 Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull
        for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood,
        and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull,
        and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
018:024 You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name
        of Yahweh; and the God who answers by fire, let him be God."
        All the people answered, "It is well said."
018:025 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull
        for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many;
        and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it."
018:026 They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it,
        and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying,
        Baal, hear us.  But there was no voice, nor any who answered.
        They leaped about the altar which was made.
018:027 It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud;
        for he is a god:  either he is musing, or he is gone aside,
        or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleeps and
        must be awakened.
018:028 They cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
        with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.
018:029 It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until
        the time of the offering of the [evening] offering; but there
        was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.
018:030 Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all
        the people came near to him.  He repaired the altar of Yahweh
        that was thrown down.
018:031 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
        of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Yahweh came, saying,
        Israel shall be your name.
018:032 With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh;
        and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
        contain two measures of seed.
018:033 He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces,
        and laid it on the wood.  He said, Fill four jars with water,
        and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.
018:034 He said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time.
        He said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.
018:035 The water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench
        also with water.
018:036 It happened at the time of the offering of the [evening] offering,
        that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Yahweh, the God
        of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this
        day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant,
        and that I have done all these things at your word.
018:037 Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know
        that you, Yahweh, are God, and [that] you have turned their
        heart back again.
018:038 Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering,
        and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up
        the water that was in the trench.
018:039 When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces:
        and they said, Yahweh, he is God; Yahweh, he is God.
018:040 and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; don't let
        one of them escape.  They took them; and Elijah brought them
        down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
018:041 Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there
        is the sound of abundance of rain.
018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink.  Elijah went up to the top
        of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put
        his face between his knees.
018:043 He said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.
        He went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing.
        He said, Go again seven times.
018:044 It happened at the seventh time, that he said, "Behold,
        a small cloud, like a man's hand, is rising out of the sea."
        He said, Go up, tell Ahab, Make ready [your chariot],
        and get you down, that the rain not stop you.
018:045 It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black
        with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.
        Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:
018:046 and the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he girded up his waist,
        and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
019:001 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had
        killed all the prophets with the sword.
019:002 Then Jezebel send a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let
        the gods do to me, and more also, if I don't make your life
        as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
019:003 When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
        to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came
        and sat down under a juniper tree:  and he requested for himself
        that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Yahweh,
        take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
019:005 He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold,
        an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
019:006 He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked
        on the coals, and a jar of water.  He ate and drink,
        and laid him down again.
019:007 The angel of Yahweh came again the second time, and touched him,
        and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.
019:008 He arose, and ate and drink, and went in the strength of that
        food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God.
019:009 He came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold,
        the word of Yahweh came to him, and he said to him, What are
        you doing here, Elijah?
019:010 He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies;
        for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant,
        thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword:
        and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life,
        to take it away.
019:011 He said, Go forth, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.
        Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore
        the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh;
        but Yahweh was not in the wind:  and after the wind an earthquake;
        but Yahweh was not in the earthquake:
019:012 and after the earthquake a fire; but Yahweh was not in the fire:
        and after the fire a still small voice.
019:013 It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
        in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance
        of the cave.  Behold, there came a voice to him, and said,
        What are you doing here, Elijah?
019:014 He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies;
        for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant,
        thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword;
        and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life,
        to take it away.
019:015 Yahweh said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness
        of Damascus:  and when you come, you shall anoint Hazael
        to be king over Syria;
019:016 and Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel;
        and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah shall you anoint
        to be prophet in your room.
019:017 It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael
        shall Jehu kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu
        shall Elisha kill.
019:018 Yet will I leave [me] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
        which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has
        not kissed him.
019:019 So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
        who was plowing, with twelve yoke [of oxen] before him,
        and he with the twelfth:  and Elijah passed over to him,
        and cast his mantle on him.
019:020 He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you,
        kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.
        He said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you?
019:021 He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen,
        and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments
        of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate.
        Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.
020:001 Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together;
        and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots:
        and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
020:002 He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city,
        and said to him, Thus says Ben Hadad,
020:003 Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children,
        even the best, are mine.
020:004 The king of Israel answered, It is according to your saying,
        my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have.
020:005 The messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben Hadad,
        saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall deliver me
        your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;
020:006 but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time,
        and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants;
        and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes,
        they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land,
        and said, Please notice how this man seeks mischief:
        for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children,
        and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn't deny him.
020:008 All the elders and all the people said to him, Don't you
        listen, neither consent.
020:009 Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my
        lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant
        at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.
        The messengers departed, and brought him word again.
020:010 Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me,
        and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls
        for all the people who follow me.
020:011 The king of Israel answered, Tell him, Don't let him who girds
        on [his armor] boast himself as he who puts it off.
020:012 It happened, when [Ben Hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking,
        he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants,
        Set [yourselves in array]. They set [themselves in array]
        against the city.
020:013 Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said,
        Thus says Yahweh, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold,
        I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know
        that I am Yahweh.
020:014 Ahab said, By whom?  He said, Thus says Yahweh, By the young
        men of the princes of the provinces.  Then he said, Who shall
        begin the battle?  He answered, You.
020:015 Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
        and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them
        he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel,
        being seven thousand.
020:016 They went out at noon.  But Ben Hadad was drinking himself
        drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two
        kings who helped him.
020:017 The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;
        and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are
        men come out from Samaria.
020:018 He said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive,
        or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.
020:019 So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes
        of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
020:020 They killed everyone his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel
        pursued them:  and Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on
        a horse with horsemen.
020:021 The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots,
        and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
020:022 The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him,
        Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do;
        for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come
        up against you.
020:023 The servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is
        a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we:
        but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
        shall be stronger than they.
020:024 Do this thing:  take the kings away, every man out of his place,
        and put captains in their room;
020:025 and number you an army, like the army that you have lost,
        horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against
        them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
        He listened to their voice, and did so.
020:026 It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered
        the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
020:027 The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned,
        and went against them:  and the children of Israel encamped
        before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians
        filled the country.
020:028 A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel,
        and said, Thus says Yahweh, Because the Syrians have said,
        Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys;
        therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand,
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
020:029 They encamped one over against the other seven days.
        So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined;
        and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred
        thousand footmen in one day.
020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell
        on twenty-seven thousand men who were left.  Ben Hadad fled,
        and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
020:031 His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that
        the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings:
        let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our bodies,
        and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel:
        peradventure he will save your life.
020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their bodies, and [put] ropes
        on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said,
        Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let me live.
        He said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
020:033 Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether
        it were his mind; and they said, Your brother Ben Hadad.
        Then he said, Go you, bring him.  Then Ben Hadad came forth to him;
        and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
020:034 [Ben Hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took
        from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets
        for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.
        I, [said Ahab], will let you go with this covenant.
        So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
020:035 A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow
        by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me.  The man refused
        to strike him.
020:036 Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice
        of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me,
        a lion shall kill you.  As soon as he was departed from him,
        a lion found him, and killed him.
020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me.
        The man struck him, smiting and wounding him.
020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
        and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
020:039 As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said,
        Your servant went out into the midst of the battle;
        and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me,
        and said, Keep this man:  if by any means he be missing,
        then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay
        a talent of silver.
020:040 As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.
        The king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be;
        yourself have decided it.
020:041 He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes;
        and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
020:042 He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go
        out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction,
        therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people
        for his people.
020:043 The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry,
        and came to Samaria.
021:001 It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
        had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace
        of Ahab king of Samaria.
021:002 Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may
        have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house;
        and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it:
        or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth
        of it in money.
021:003 Naboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give
        the inheritance of my fathers to you.
021:004 Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word
        which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said,
        I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.
        He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face,
        and would eat no bread.
021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your
        spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?
021:006 He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,
        and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else,
        if it please you, I will give you [another] vineyard for it:
        and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.
021:007 Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom
        of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry:
        I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal,
        and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were
        in his city, [and] who lived with Naboth.
021:009 She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
        Naboth on high among the people:
021:010 and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them
        testify against him, saying, You did curse God and the king.
        Then carry him out, and stone him to death.
021:011 The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived
        in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it
        was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
021:013 The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him:
        and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth,
        in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God
        and the king.  Then they carried him forth out of the city,
        and stoned him to death with stones.
021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned,
        and is dead.
021:015 It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
        and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession
        of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused
        to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
021:016 It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
        rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
        to take possession of it.
021:017 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria:
        behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone
        down to take possession of it.
021:019 You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you
        killed and also taken possession?  You shall speak to him,
        saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked
        the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.
021:020 Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy?
        He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself
        to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.
021:021 Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you
        away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against
        a wall,{or, male} and him who is shut up and him who is left
        at large in Israel:
021:022 and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son
        of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah
        for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger,
        and have made Israel to sin.
021:023 Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat
        Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.
021:024 Him who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat;
        and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.
021:025 (But there was none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do
        that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel
        his wife stirred up.
021:026 He did very abominably in following idols, according to
        all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before
        the children of Israel.)
021:027 It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes,
        and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth,
        and went softly.
021:028 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
021:029 See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles
        himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days;
        but in his son's days will I bring the evil on his house.
022:001 They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
022:002 It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
        of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
022:003 The king of Israel said to his servants, "You know that
        Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and don't take it
        out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
022:004 He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to
        Ramoth Gilead?  Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am
        as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
022:005 Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first
        for the word of Yahweh.
022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together,
        about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go
        against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?
        They said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand
        of the king.
022:007 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides,
        that we may inquire of him?
022:008 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man
        by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah:
        but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me,
        but evil.  Jehoshaphat said, "Don't let the king say so."
022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly
        Micaiah the son of Imlah.
022:010 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
        were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes,
        in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria;
        and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
022:011 Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said,
        Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians,
        until they be consumed.
022:012 All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead,
        and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand
        of the king.
022:013 The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now,
        the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth:
        please let your word be like the word of one of them,
        and speak you good.
022:014 Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me,
        that will I speak.
022:015 When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah,
        shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?
        He answered him, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver
        it into the hand of the king.
022:016 The king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you
        speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?
022:017 He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep
        that have no shepherd:  and Yahweh said, These have no master;
        let them return every man to his house in peace.
022:018 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you
        that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
022:019 [Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh:  I saw
        Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven
        standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
022:020 Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up
        and fall at Ramoth Gilead?'  One said on this manner;
        and another said on that manner.
022:021 There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said,
        'I will entice him.'
022:022 Yahweh said to him, 'How?'  He said, 'I will go forth,
        and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.'
        He said, 'You shall entice him, and shall prevail also:
        go forth, and do so.'
022:023 Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in
        the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken
        evil concerning you."
022:024 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah
        on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh
        from me to speak to you?
022:025 Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you
        shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
022:026 The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
        to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
022:027 and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
        until I come in peace.
022:028 Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not
        spoken by me.  He said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.
022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramoth Gilead.
022:030 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
        and go into the battle; but put you on your robes.
        The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
022:031 Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains
        of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great,
        save only with the king of Israel.
022:032 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
        that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they
        turned aside to fight against him:  and Jehoshaphat cried out.
022:033 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was
        not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
022:034 A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck
        the king of Israel between the joints of the armor:
        therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand,
        and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.
022:035 The battle increased that day:  and the king was stayed
        up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even;
        and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
022:036 There went a cry throughout the army about the going down
        of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man
        to his country.
022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
        the king in Samaria.
022:038 They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked
        up his blood (now the prostitutes washed themselves [there]);
        according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke.
022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did,
        and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that
        he built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned
        in his place.
022:041 Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth
        year of Ahab king of Israel.
022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign;
        and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem.
        His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
022:043 He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn't turn aside
        from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh:
        however the high places were not taken away; the people still
        sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
022:044 Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that
        he shown, and how he warred, aren't they written in the book
        of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
022:046 The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his
        father Asa, he put away out of the land.
022:047 There was no king in Edom:  a deputy was king.
022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold:
        but they didn't go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.
022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants
        go with your servants in the ships.  But Jehoshaphat would not.
022:050 Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son
        reigned in his place.
022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
        in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
        and he reigned two years over Israel.
022:052 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother,
        and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made
        Israel to sin.
022:053 He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
Book 12 2 Kings
001:001 Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
001:002 Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber
        that was in Samaria, and was sick:  and he sent messengers,
        and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron,
        whether I shall recover of this sickness.
001:003 But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up
        to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them,
        Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire
        of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?
001:004 Now therefore thus says Yahweh, You shall not come down
        from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.
        Elijah departed.
001:005 The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it
        that you have returned?
001:006 They said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said
        to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you, and tell him,
        Thus says Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel,
        that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?
        therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you
        are gone up, but shall surely die.
001:007 He said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you,
        and told you these words?
001:008 They answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a belt
        of leather about his waist.  He said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
001:009 Then [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
        He went up to him:  and behold, he was sitting on the top
        of the hill.  He spoke to him, man of God, the king
        has said, Come down.
001:010 Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God,
        let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty.
        Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.
001:011 Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty.
        He answered him, man of God, thus has the king said,
        Come down quickly.
001:012 Elijah answered them, If I be a man of God, let fire come
        down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty.
        The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him
        and his fifty.
001:013 Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty.
        The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees
        before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, man of God,
        please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants,
        be precious in your sight.
001:014 Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former
        captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life
        be precious in your sight.
001:015 The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with him:
        don't be afraid of him.  He arose, and went down with him
        to the king.
001:016 He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have sent messengers
        to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because
        there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore
        you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up,
        but shall surely die.
001:017 So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken.
        Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram
        the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
001:018 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren't they
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
002:001 It happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind
        into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
002:002 Elijah said to Elisha, Please wait here, for Yahweh has
        sent me as far as Bethel.  Elisha said, As Yahweh lives,
        and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.  So they went
        down to Bethel.
002:003 The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha,
        and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away
        your master from your head today?"  He said, "Yes, I know it;
        hold your peace."
002:004 Elijah said to him, Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent
        me to Jericho.  He said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives,
        I will not leave you.  So they came to Jericho.
002:005 The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha,
        and said to him, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away your
        master from your head today?"  He answered, "Yes, I know it.
        Hold your peace."
002:006 Elijah said to him, "Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent
        me to the Jordan."  He said, "As Yahweh lives, and as your
        soul lives, I will not leave you."  They two went on.
002:007 Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over
        against them afar off:  and they two stood by the Jordan.
002:008 Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck
        the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they
        two went over on dry ground.
002:009 It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said
        to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.
        Elisha said, please let a double portion of your spirit
        be on me.
002:010 He said, You have asked a hard thing:  [nevertheless], if you
        see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you;
        but if not, it shall not be so.
002:011 It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold,
        [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
        which parted them both apart; and Elijah went up by a
        whirlwind into heaven.
002:012 Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots
        of Israel and the horsemen of it!  He saw him no more:
        and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.
002:013 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him,
        and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
002:014 He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck
        the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?
        and when he also had struck the waters, they were divided
        here and there; and Elisha went over.
002:015 When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him
        saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha.
        They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
        ground before him.
002:016 They said to him, See now, there are with your servants
        fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek
        your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up,
        and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley.
        He said, You shall not send.
002:017 When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send.
        They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days,
        but didn't find him.
002:018 They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said
        to them, "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't go?'"
002:019 The men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray you,
        the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees:
        but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.
002:020 He said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt therein.
        They brought it to him.
002:021 He went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein,
        and said, Thus says Yahweh, I have healed these waters;
        there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.
002:022 So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word
        of Elisha which he spoke.
002:023 He went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up
        by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him,
        and said to him, Go up, you baldy; go up, you baldhead.
002:024 He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name
        of Yahweh.  Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled
        forty-two of those youths.
002:025 He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there
        he returned to Samaria.
003:001 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
        Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
        and reigned twelve years.
003:002 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like
        his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar
        of Baal that his father had made.
003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        with which he made Israel to sin; he didn't depart from it.
003:004 Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered
        to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs,
        and of one hundred thousand rams.
003:005 But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
        rebelled against the king of Israel.
003:006 King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time,
        and mustered all Israel.
003:007 He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
        The king of Moab has rebelled against me:  will you go
        with me against Moab to battle?  He said, I will go up:
        I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses
        as your horses.
003:008 He said, Which way shall we go up?  He answered, The way
        of the wilderness of Edom.
003:009 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king
        of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey:
        and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals
        that followed them.
003:010 The king of Israel said, Alas! for Yahweh has called these
        three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
003:011 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh,
        that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?  One of the king of
        Israel's servants answered, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here,
        who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
003:012 Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with him.
        So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom
        went down to him.
003:013 Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you?
        get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets
        of your mother.  The king of Israel said to him, No; for Yahweh
        has called these three kings together to deliver them into
        the hand of Moab.
003:014 Elisha said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
        surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat
        the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.
003:015 But now bring me a minstrel.  It happened, when the minstrel played,
        that the hand of Yahweh came on him.
003:016 He said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.
003:017 For thus says Yahweh, You shall not see wind, neither shall you
        see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you
        shall drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.
003:018 This is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh:
        he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
003:019 You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city,
        and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water,
        and mar every good piece of land with stones.
003:020 It happened in the morning, about the time of offering
        the offering, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
        and the country was filled with water.
003:021 Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up
        to fight against them, they gathered themselves together,
        all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood
        on the border.
003:022 They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water,
        and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:
003:023 and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed,
        and they have struck each man his fellow:  now therefore,
        Moab, to the spoil.
003:024 When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
        up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them;
        
118:012 They surrounded me like bees.  They are quenched like the down to him with a staff,
        and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.d; but he went down to him with a staff,
        and plucked the spear out of the Egyp09 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put
        confidence in princes.
118:010 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of Yahweh, I
        cut them off.
118:011 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.  In the name
        of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.
118:012 They surrounded me like bees.  They are quenched like the
        burning thorns.  In the name of Yahweh I cut them off.
118:013 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me.
118:014 Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.
118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of
        the righteous.  "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.
118:016 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!  The right hand of
        Yahweh does valiantly!"
118:017 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah's works.
118:018 Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me
        over to death.
118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness.  I will enter into them.
        I will give thanks to Yah.
118:020 This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it.
118:021 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have
        become my salvation.
118:022 The stone which the builders rejected has become the head
        of the corner.
118:023 This is Yahweh's doing.  It is marvelous in our eyes.
118:024 This is the day that Yahweh has made.  We will rejoice and be
        glad in it!
118:025 Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh!  Yahweh, we beg you,
        send prosperity now.
118:026 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!  We have blessed
        you out of the house of Yahweh.
118:027 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light.  Bind the sacrifice
        with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
118:028 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.
        You are my God, I will exalt you.
118:029 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
119:001 <<ALEPH>> Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,
        who walk according to Yahweh's law.
119:002 Blessed are those who keep his statutes, who seek him with
        their whole heart.
119:003 Yes, they do nothing wrong.  They walk in his ways.
119:004 You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them.
119:005 Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes!
119:006 Then I wouldn't be disappointed, when I consider all
        of your commandments.
119:007 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I
        learn your righteous judgments.
119:008 I will observe your statutes.  Don't utterly forsake me.
119:009 How can a young man keep his way pure?  By living according
        to your word.
119:010 With my whole heart, I have sought you.  Don't let me wander
        from your commandments.
119:011 I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not
        sin against you.
119:012 Blessed are you, Yahweh.  Teach me your statutes.
119:013 With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.
119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much
        as in all riches.
119:015 I will meditate on your precepts, and consider your ways.
119:016 I will delight myself in your statutes.  I will not
        forget your word.
119:017 Do good to your servant.  I will live and I will obey your word.
119:018 Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of your law.
119:019 I am a stranger on the earth.  Don't hide your commandments from me.
119:020 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.
119:021 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander
        from your commandments.
119:022 Take reproach and contempt away from me, for I have
        kept your statutes.
119:023 Though princes sit and slander me, your servant will meditate
        on your statutes.
119:024 Indeed your statutes are my delight, and my counselors.
119:025 My soul is laid low in the dust.  Revive me according
        to your word!
119:026 I declared my ways, and you answered me.  Teach me your statutes.
119:027 Let me understand the teaching of your precepts!
        Then I will meditate on your wondrous works.
119:028 My soul is weary with sorrow:  strengthen me according
        to your word.
119:029 Keep me from the way of deceit.  Grant me your law graciously!
119:030 I have chosen the way of truth.  I have set your ordinances
        before me.
119:031 I cling to your statutes, Yahweh.  Don't let me be disappointed.
119:032 I run in the path of your commandments, for you have set
        my heart free.
119:033 Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your statutes.  I will keep them
        to the end.
119:034 Give me understanding, and I will keep your law.  Yes, I will
        obey it with my whole heart.
119:035 Direct me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in them.
119:036 Turn my heart toward your statutes, not toward selfish gain.
119:037 Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things.
        Revive me in your ways.
119:038 Fulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared.
119:039 Take away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.
119:040 Behold, I long for your precepts!  Revive me in your righteousness.
119:041 Let your loving kindness also come to me, Yahweh, your salvation,
        according to your word.
119:042 So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I
        trust in your word.
119:043 Don't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth, for I put
        my hope in your ordinances.
119:044 So I will obey your law continually, forever and ever.
119:045 I will walk in liberty, for I have sought your precepts.
119:046 I will also speak of your statutes before kings, and will
        not be disappointed.
119:047 I will delight myself in your commandments, because I love them.
119:048 I reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love.
        I will meditate on your statutes.
119:049 Remember your word to your servant, because you gave me hope.
119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.
119:051 The arrogant mock me excessively, but I don't swerve from your law.
119:052 I remember your ordinances of old, Yahweh, and have comforted myself.
119:053 Indignation has taken hold on me, because of the wicked
        who forsake your law.
119:054 Your statutes have been my songs, in the house where I live.
119:055 I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, and I
        obey your law.
119:056 This is my way, that I keep your precepts.
119:057 Yahweh is my portion.  I promised to obey your words.
119:058 I sought your favor with my whole heart.  Be merciful to me
        according to your word.
119:059 I considered my ways, and turned my steps to your statutes.
119:060 I will hurry, and not delay, to obey your commandments.
119:061 The ropes of the wicked bind me, but I won't forget your law.
119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, because of
        your righteous ordinances.
119:063 I am a friend of all those who fear you, of those who
        observe your precepts.
119:064 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh.
        Teach me your statutes.
119:065 Do good to your servant, according to your word, Yahweh.
119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe
        in your commandments.
119:067 Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I observe your word.
119:068 You are good, and do good.  Teach me your statutes.
119:069 The proud have smeared a lie upon me.  With my whole heart,
        I will keep your precepts.
119:070 Their heart is as callous as the fat, but I delight in your law.
119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may
        learn your statutes.
119:072 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces
        of gold and silver.
119:073 Your hands have made me and formed me.  Give me understanding,
        that I may learn your commandments.
119:074 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put
        my hope in your word.
119:075 Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in
        faithfulness you have afflicted me.
119:076 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to
        your word to your servant.
119:077 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;
        for your law is my delight.
119:078 Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown
        me wrongfully.  I will meditate on your precepts.
119:079 Let those who fear you turn to me.  They will know your statutes.
119:080 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may
        not be disappointed.
119:081 My soul faints for your salvation.  I hope in your word.
119:082 My eyes fail for your word.  I say, "When will you comfort me?"
119:083 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.
        I don't forget your statutes.
119:084 How many are the days of your servant?  When will you execute
        judgment on those who persecute me?
119:085 The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law.
119:086 All of your commandments are faithful.  They persecute
        me wrongfully.  Help me!
119:087 They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn't
        forsake your precepts.
119:088 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I
        will obey the statutes of your mouth.
119:089 Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever.
119:090 Your faithfulness is to all generations.  You have established
        the earth, and it remains.
119:091 Your laws remain to this day, for all things serve you.
119:092 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished
        in my affliction.
119:093 I will never forget your precepts, for with them,
        you have revived me.
119:094 I am yours.  Save me, for I have sought your precepts.
119:095 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me.
        I will consider your statutes.
119:096 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands
        are boundless.
119:097 How I love your law!  It is my meditation all day.
119:098 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your
        commandments are always with me.
119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your
        testimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the aged, because I have kept your precepts.
119:101 I have kept my feet from every evil way, that I might
        observe your word.
119:102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances, for you
        have taught me.
119:103 How sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey
        to my mouth!
119:104 Through your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate
        every false way.
119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey
        your righteous ordinances.
119:107 I am afflicted very much.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word.
119:108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth.
        Yahweh, teach me your ordinances.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I won't forget your law.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I haven't gone astray
        from your precepts.
119:111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they
        are the joy of my heart.
119:112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever,
        even to the end.
119:113 I hate double-minded men, but I love your law.
119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield.  I hope in your word.
119:115 Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments
        of my God.
119:116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.
        Let me not be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for
        your statutes continually.
119:118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their
        deceit is in vain.
119:119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.
        Therefore I love your testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you.  I am afraid of your judgments.
119:121 I have done what is just and righteous.  Don't leave me
        to my oppressors.
119:122 Ensure your servant's well-being. Don't let the proud oppress me.
119:123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word.
119:124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.
        Teach me your statutes.
119:125 I am your servant.  Give me understanding, that I may
        know your testimonies.
119:126 It is time to act, Yahweh, for they break your law.
119:127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes,
        more than pure gold.
119:128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.
        I hate every false way.
119:129 Your testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them.
119:130 The entrance of your words gives light.  It gives understanding
        to the simple.
119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed
        for your commandments.
119:132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those
        who love your name.
119:133 Establish my footsteps in your word.  Don't let any iniquity
        have dominion over me.
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man, so I will observe
        your precepts.
119:135 Make your face shine on your servant.  Teach me your statutes.
119:136 Streams of tears run down my eyes, because they don't
        observe your law.
119:137 You are righteous, Yahweh.  Your judgments are upright.
119:138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness.
        They are fully trustworthy.
119:139 My zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words.
119:140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your
        servant loves them.
119:141 I am small and despised.  I don't forget your precepts.
119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.
        Your law is truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me.  Your commandments
        are my delight.
119:144 Your testimonies are righteous forever.  Give me understanding,
        that I may live.
119:145 I have called with my whole heart.  Answer me, Yahweh!  I will
        keep your statutes.
119:146 I have called to you.  Save me!  I will obey your statutes.
119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help.  I put my hope in your words.
119:148 My eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might
        meditate on your word.
119:149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness.
        Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances.
119:150 They draw near who follow after wickedness.  They are far
        from your law.
119:151 You are near, Yahweh.  All your commandments are truth.
119:152 Of old I have known from your testimonies, that you have
        founded them forever.
119:153 Consider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don't forget your law.
119:154 Plead my cause, and redeem me!  Revive me according to your promise.
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they don't seek your statutes.
119:156 Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh.  Revive me according
        to your ordinances.
119:157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries.  I haven't swerved
        from your testimonies.
119:158 I look at the faithless with loathing, because they don't
        observe your word.
119:159 Consider how I love your precepts.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to
        your loving kindness.
119:160 All of your words are truth.  Every one of your righteous
        ordinances endures forever.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands
        in awe of your words.
119:162 I rejoice at your word, as one who finds great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood.  I love your law.
119:164 Seven times a day, I praise you, because of your
        righteous ordinances.
119:165 Those who love your law have great peace.  Nothing causes
        them to stumble.
119:166 I have hoped for your salvation, Yahweh.  I have
        done your commandments.
119:167 My soul has observed your testimonies.  I love them exceedingly.
119:168 I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies, for all my
        ways are before you.
119:169 Let my cry come before you, Yahweh.  Give me understanding
        according to your word.
119:170 Let my supplication come before you.  Deliver me according
        to your word.
119:171 Let my lips utter praise, for you teach me your statutes.
119:172 Let my tongue sing of your word, for all your commandments
        are righteousness.
119:173 Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
119:174 I have longed for your salvation, Yahweh.  Your law is my delight.
119:175 Let my soul live, that I may praise you.  Let your
        ordinances help me.
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep.  Seek your servant,
        for I don't forget your commandments.
120:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.
        He answered me.
120:002 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
120:003 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,
        you deceitful tongue?
120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
120:005 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among
        the tents of Kedar!
120:006 My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace.
120:007 I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
121:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
        Where does my help come from?
121:002 My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
121:003 He will not allow your foot to be moved.  He who keeps you
        will not slumber.
121:004 Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
121:005 Yahweh is your keeper.  Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
121:006 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
121:007 Yahweh will keep you from all evil.  He will keep your soul.
121:008 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this
        time forth, and forevermore.
122:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> I was glad when they said to me,
        "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
122:002 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
122:003 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
122:004 where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, according to an
        ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
122:005 For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones
        of David's house.
122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  Those who love you will prosper.
122:007 Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
122:008 For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say,
        "Peace be within you."
122:009 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
123:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> To you I do lift up my eyes, you who sit
        in the heavens.
123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
        as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
        look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.
123:003 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have
        endured much contempt.
123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who
        are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
124:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> If it had not been Yahweh
        who was on our side, let Israel now say,
124:002 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose
        up against us;
124:003 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath
        was kindled against us;
124:004 then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would
        have gone over our soul;
124:005 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
124:006 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:007 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare.
        The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
124:008 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
125:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,
        which can't be moved, but remains forever.
125:002 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his
        people from this time forth and forevermore.
125:003 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment
        of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands
        to do evil.
125:004 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright
        in their hearts.
125:005 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,
        Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.
        Peace be on Israel.
126:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> When Yahweh brought back those who returned
        to Zion, we were like those who dream.
126:002 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing.
        Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great
        things for them."
126:003 Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad.
126:004 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev.
126:005 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
126:006 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly
        come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
127:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By Solomon.>> Unless Yahweh builds
        the house, they labor in vain who build it.  Unless Yahweh
        watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain.
127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late,
        eating the bread of toil; for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
127:003 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.  The fruit of the womb
        is his reward.
127:004 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth.
127:005 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.
        They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies
        in the gate.
128:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,
        who walks in his ways.
128:002 For you will eat the labor of your hands.  You will be happy,
        and it will be well with you.
128:003 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost
        parts of your house; your children like olive plants,
        around your table.
128:004 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
128:005 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good
        of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
128:006 Yes, may you see your children's children.  Peace be upon Israel.
129:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Many times they have afflicted me
        from my youth up.  Let Israel now say,
129:002 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they
        have not prevailed against me.
129:003 The plowers plowed on my back.  They made their furrows long.
129:004 Yahweh is righteous.  He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
129:005 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those
        who hate Zion.
129:006 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers
        before it grows up;
129:007 with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, nor he who
        binds sheaves, his bosom.
129:008 Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you.
        We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
130:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Out of the depths I have cried
        to you, Yahweh.
130:002 Lord, hear my voice.  Let your ears be attentive to the voice
        of my petitions.
130:003 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
130:004 But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.
130:005 I wait for Yahweh.  My soul waits.  I hope in his word.
130:006 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning;
        more than watchmen for the morning.
130:007 Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh there is loving kindness.
        With him is abundant redemption.
130:008 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
131:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty,
        nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters,
        or things too wonderful for me.
131:002 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child
        with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
131:003 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
132:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,
132:002 how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:003 "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,
        nor go up into my bed;
132:004 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
132:005 until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the
        Mighty One of Jacob."
132:006 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.  We found it in the
        field of Jaar:
132:007 "We will go into his dwelling place.  We will worship
        at his footstool.
132:008 Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; you, and the ark
        of your strength.
132:009 Let your priest be clothed with righteousness.  Let your saints
        shout for joy!"
132:010 For your servant David's sake, don't turn away the face
        of your anointed one.
132:011 Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.  He will not turn from it:
        "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
132:012 If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony
        that I will teach them, their children also will sit on
        your throne forevermore."
132:013 For Yahweh has chosen Zion.  He has desired it for his habitation.
132:014 "This is my resting place forever.  Here I will live, for I
        have desired it.
132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision.  I will satisfy her
        poor with bread.
132:016 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation.  Her saints
        will shout aloud for joy.
132:017 There I will make the horn of David to bud.  I have ordained
        a lamp for my anointed.
132:018 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself,
        his crown will be resplendent."
133:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> See how good and how pleasant
        it is for brothers to live together in unity!
133:002 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard,
        even Aaron's beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;
133:003 like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion:
        for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forevermore.
134:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Look!  Praise Yahweh, all you servants
        of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh's house!
134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.  Praise Yahweh!
134:003 May Yahweh bless you from Zion; even he who made heaven and earth.
135:001 Praise Yah!  Praise the name of Yahweh!  Praise him,
        you servants of Yahweh,
135:002 you who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of
        our God's house.
135:003 Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good.  Sing praises to his name,
        for that is pleasant.
135:004 For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself; Israel for his own possession.
135:005 For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Lord is above all gods.
135:006 Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth,
        in the seas and in all deeps;
135:007 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;
        who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings forth the wind
        out of his treasuries;
135:008 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal;
135:009 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh,
        and on all his servants;
135:010 who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,
135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all
        the kingdoms of Canaan,
135:012 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people.
135:013 Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh,
        throughout all generations.
135:014 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants.
135:015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work
        of men's hands.
135:016 They have mouths, but they can't speak.  They have eyes,
        but they can't see.
135:017 They have ears, but they can't hear; neither is there any breath
        in their mouths.
135:018 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who
        trusts in them.
135:019 House of Israel, praise Yahweh!  House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
135:020 House of Levi, praise Yahweh!  You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!
135:021 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who dwells at Jerusalem.
        Praise Yah!
136:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
136:002 Give thanks to the God of gods; for his loving kindness
        endures forever.
136:003 Give thanks to the Lord of lords; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:004 To him who alone does great wonders; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:005 To him who by understanding made the heavens; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:006 To him who spread out the earth above the waters; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:007 To him who made the great lights; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:008 The sun to rule by day; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:010 To him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:011 And brought out Israel from among them; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:012 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:013 To him who divided the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} apart;
        for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds};
        for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:016 To him who led his people through the wilderness; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:017 To him who struck great kings; for his loving kindness
        endures forever;
136:018 And killed mighty kings; for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:020 Og king of Bashan; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:021 And gave their land as an inheritance; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:022 Even a heritage to Israel his servant; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:024 And has delivered us from our adversaries; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:025 Who gives food to every creature; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
136:026 Oh give thanks to the God of heaven; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.  Yes, we wept,
        when we remembered Zion.
137:002 On the willows in the midst of it, we hung up our harps.
137:003 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.
        Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:  "Sing us one
        of the songs of Zion!"
137:004 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land?
137:005 If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.
137:006 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you;
        if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:007 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem;
        who said, "Raze it!  Raze it even to its foundation!"
137:008 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, he will be happy
        who rewards you, as you have served us.
137:009 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones
        against the rock.
138:001 <<By David.>> I will give you thanks with my whole heart.
        Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
138:002 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks
        to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;
        for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
138:003 In the day that I called, you answered me.  You encouraged me
        with strength in my soul.
138:004 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, for they
        have heard the words of your mouth.
138:005 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh; for great
        is Yahweh's glory.
138:006 For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;
        but the proud, he knows from afar.
138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.
        You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies.
        Your right hand will save me.
138:008 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving
        kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.  Don't forsake the works
        of your own hands.
139:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh,
        you have searched me, and you know me.
139:002 You know my sitting down and my rising up.  You perceive
        my thoughts from afar.
139:003 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted
        with all my ways.
139:004 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Yahweh,
        you know it altogether.
139:005 You hem me in behind and before.  You laid your hand on me.
139:006 This knowledge is beyond me.  It's lofty.  I can't attain it.
139:007 Where could I go from your Spirit?  Or where could I flee
        from your presence?
139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.  If I make my bed
        in Sheol, behold, you are there!
139:009 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost
        parts of the sea;
139:010 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand
        will hold me.
139:011 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light
        around me will be night;"
139:012 even the darkness doesn't hide from you, but the night shines
        as the day.  The darkness is like light to you.
139:013 For you formed my inmost being.  You knit me together in
        my mother's womb.
139:014 I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
        Your works are wonderful.  My soul knows that very well.
139:015 My frame wasn't hidden from you, when I was made in secret,
        woven together in the depths of the earth.
139:016 Your eyes saw my body.  In your book they were all written,
        the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were
        none of them.
139:017 How precious to me are your thoughts, God!  How vast is
        the sum of them!
139:018 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.
        When I wake up, I am still with you.
139:019 If only you, God, would kill the wicked.  Get away from me,
        you bloodthirsty men!
139:020 For they speak against you wickedly.  Your enemies take your
        name in vain.
139:021 Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate you?  Am I not grieved
        with those who rise up against you?
139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred.  They have become my enemies.
139:023 Search me, God, and know my heart.  Try me, and know my thoughts.
139:024 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in
        the everlasting way.
140:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Deliver me,
        Yahweh, from the evil man.  Preserve me from the violent man;
140:002 those who devise mischief in their hearts.  They continually
        gather themselves together for war.
140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.
        Viper's poison is under their lips.  Selah.
140:004 Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.  Preserve me
        from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
140:005 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords
        of a net by the path.  They have set traps for me.  Selah.
140:006 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God."  Listen to the cry
        of my petitions, Yahweh.
140:007 Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered
        my head in the day of battle.
140:008 Yahweh, don't grant the desires of the wicked.  Don't let
        their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.  Selah.
140:009 As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief
        of their own lips cover them.
140:010 Let burning coals fall on them.  Let them be thrown into the fire,
        into miry pits, from where they never rise.
140:011 An evil speaker won't be established in the earth.
        Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:012 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and justice for the needy.
140:013 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.
        The upright will dwell in your presence.
141:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, I have called on you.
        Come to me quickly!  Listen to my voice when I call to you.
141:002 Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up
        of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
141:003 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.  Keep the door of my lips.
141:004 Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds
        of wickedness with men who work iniquity.  Don't let me eat
        of their delicacies.
141:005 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me,
        it is like oil on the head; don't let my head refuse it;
        Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
141:006 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.
        They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
141:007 "As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are
        scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
141:008 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.  In you, I take refuge.
        Don't leave my soul destitute.
141:009 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
        from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
141:010 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.
142:001 <<A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave.
        A Prayer.>> I cry with my voice to Yahweh.  With my voice,
        I ask Yahweh for mercy.
142:002 I pour out my complaint before him.  I tell him my troubles.
142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my path.
        In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
142:004 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned
        for me.  Refuge has fled from me.  No one cares for my soul.
142:005 I cried to you, Yahweh.  I said, "You are my refuge, my portion
        in the land of the living."
142:006 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.  deliver me
        from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name.
        The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.
143:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh.  Listen to
        my petitions.  In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
143:002 Don't enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight
        no man living is righteous.
143:003 For the enemy pursues my soul.  He has struck my life
        down to the ground.  He has made me live in dark places,
        as those who have been long dead.
143:004 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.  My heart within
        me is desolate.
143:005 I remember the days of old.  I meditate on all your doings.
        I contemplate the work of your hands.
143:006 I spread forth my hands to you.  My soul thirsts for you,
        like a parched land.  Selah.
143:007 Hurry to answer me, Yahweh.  My spirit fails.  Don't hide
        your face from me, so that I don't become like those who go
        down into the pit.
143:008 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I
        trust in you.  Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,
        for I lift up my soul to you.
143:009 Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies.  I flee to you to hide me.
143:010 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.  Your Spirit is good.
        Lead me in the land of uprightness.
143:011 Revive me, Yahweh, for your name's sake.  In your righteousness,
        bring my soul out of trouble.
143:012 In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all
        those who afflict my soul, For I am your servant.
144:001 <<By David.>> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches my hands
        to war, and my fingers to battle:
144:002 my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer,
        my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; who subdues my
        people under me.
144:003 Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him?  Or the son of man,
        that you think of him?
144:004 Man is like a breath.  His days are like a shadow that passes away.
144:005 Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down.  Touch the mountains,
        and they will smoke.
144:006 Throw out lightning, and scatter them.  Send out your arrows,
        and rout them.
144:007 Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me
        out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
144:008 whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.
144:009 I will sing a new song to you, God.  On a ten-stringed lyre,
        I will sing praises to you.
144:010 You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David,
        his servant, from the deadly sword.
144:011 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,
        whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.
144:012 Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters
        like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
144:013 Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision.
        Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
144:014 Our oxen will pull heavy loads.  There is no breaking in,
        and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
144:015 Happy are the people who are in such a situation.
        Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.  {}
145:001 <<A praise psalm by David.This is an acrostic psalm,
        with every verse (including the second half of verse 13)
        starting with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.>>
        I will exalt you, my God, the King.  I will praise your name
        forever and ever.
145:002 Every day I will praise you.  I will extol your name
        forever and ever.
145:003 Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!
        His greatness is unsearchable.
145:004 One generation will commend your works to another, and will
        declare your mighty acts.
145:005 Of the glorious majesty of your honor, of your wondrous works,
        I will meditate.
145:006 Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts.
        I will declare your greatness.
145:007 They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will
        sing of your righteousness.
145:008 Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of
        great loving kindness.
145:009 Yahweh is good to all.  His tender mercies are over all his works.
145:010 All your works will give thanks to you, Yahweh.  Your saints
        will extol you.
145:011 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk
        about your power;
145:012 to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the glory
        of the majesty of his kingdom.
145:013 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.  Your dominion endures
        throughout all generations.  Yahweh is faithful in all his words,
        and loving in all his deeds.{Some manuscripts omit these
        last two lines.}
145:014 Yahweh upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who
        are bowed down.
145:015 The eyes of all wait for you.  You give them their food
        in due season.
145:016 You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
145:017 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
145:018 Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all who call
        on him in truth.
145:019 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.
        He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
145:020 Yahweh preserves all those who love him, but all the wicked
        he will destroy.
145:021 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh.  Let all flesh bless
        his holy name forever and ever.
146:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh, my soul.
146:002 While I live, I will praise Yahweh.  I will sing praises
        to my God as long as I exist.
146:003 Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom
        there is no help.
146:004 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.
        In that very day, his thoughts perish.
146:005 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
        is in Yahweh, his God:
146:006 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
        who keeps truth forever;
146:007 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry.
        Yahweh frees the prisoners.
146:008 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.  Yahweh raises up those
        who are bowed down.  Yahweh loves the righteous.
146:009 Yahweh preserves the foreigners.  He upholds the fatherless
        and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
146:010 Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations.
        Praise Yah!
147:001 Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God;
        for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.
147:002 Yahweh builds up Jerusalem.  He gathers together the
        outcasts of Israel.
147:003 He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
147:004 He counts the number of the stars.  He calls them all
        by their names.
147:005 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power.  His understanding
        is infinite.
147:006 Yahweh upholds the humble.  He brings the wicked down
        to the ground.
147:007 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving.  Sing praises on the harp
        to our God,
147:008 who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth,
        who makes grass grow on the mountains.
147:009 He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens
        when they call.
147:010 He doesn't delight in the strength of the horse.
        He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
147:011 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope
        in his loving kindness.
147:012 Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem!  Praise your God, Zion!
147:013 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.
        He has blessed your children within you.
147:014 He makes peace in your borders.  He fills you with the finest
        of the wheat.
147:015 He sends out his commandment to the earth.  His word
        runs very swiftly.
147:016 He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes.
147:017 He hurls down his hail like pebbles.  Who can stand before his cold?
147:018 He sends out his word, and melts them.  He causes his wind
        to blow, and the waters flow.
147:019 He shows his word to Jacob; his statutes and his ordinances
        to Israel.
147:020 He has not done this for just any nation.  They don't know
        his ordinances.  Praise Yah!
148:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh from the heavens!  Praise him
        in the heights!
148:002 Praise him, all his angels!  Praise him, all his army!
148:003 Praise him, sun and moon!  Praise him, all you shining stars!
148:004 Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You waters that are
        above the heavens.
148:005 Let them praise the name of Yahweh, For he commanded,
        and they were created.
148:006 He has also established them forever and ever.  He has made
        a decree which will not pass away.
148:007 Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures,
        and all depths!
148:008 Lightning and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind,
        fulfilling his word;
148:009 mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars;
148:010 wild animals and all livestock; small creatures and flying birds;
148:011 kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges
        of the earth;
148:012 both young men and maidens; old men and children:
148:013 let them praise the name of Yahweh, for his name alone is exalted.
        His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
148:014 He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all
        his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near
        to him.  Praise Yah!
149:001 Praise Yahweh!  Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in
        the assembly of the saints.
149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.  Let the children
        of Zion be joyful in their King.
149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance!  Let them sing praises
        to him with tambourine and harp!
149:004 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.  He crowns
        the humble with salvation.
149:005 Let the saints rejoice in honor.  Let them sing for joy
        on their beds.
149:006 May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged
        sword in their hand;
149:007 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with
        fetters of iron;
149:009 to execute on them the written judgment.  All his saints
        have this honor.  Praise Yah!
150:001 Praise Yah!  Praise God in his sanctuary!  Praise him in his
        heavens for his acts of power!
150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts!  Praise him according to
        his excellent greatness!
150:003 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet!  Praise him
        with harp and lyre!
150:004 Praise him with tambourine and dancing!  Praise him with stringed
        instruments and flute!
150:005 Praise him with loud cymbals!  Praise him with resounding cymbals!
150:006 Let everything that has breath praise Yah!  Praise Yah!
Book 20 Proverbs
001:001 The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
001:002 to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
001:003 to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness,
        justice, and equity;
001:004 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion
        to the young man:
001:005 that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
        that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
001:006 to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles
        of the wise.
001:007 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish
        despise wisdom and instruction.
001:008 My son, listen to your father's instruction, and don't forsake
        your mother's teaching:
001:009 for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains
        around your neck.
001:010 My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent.
001:011 If they say, "Come with us, Let's lay in wait for blood;
        let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
001:012 let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those
        who go down into the pit.
001:013 We'll find all valuable wealth.  We'll fill our houses with spoil.
001:014 You shall cast your lot among us.  We'll all have one purse."
001:015 My son, don't walk in the way with them.  Keep your foot
        from their path,
001:016 for their feet run to evil.  They hurry to shed blood.
001:017 For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
001:018 but these lay wait for their own blood.  They lurk secretly
        for their own lives.
001:019 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.
        It takes away the life of its owners.
001:020 Wisdom calls aloud in the street.  She utters her voice
        in the public squares.
001:021 She calls at the head of noisy places.  At the entrance
        of the city gates, she utters her words:
001:022 "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
        How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
        and fools hate knowledge?
001:023 Turn at my reproof.  Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
        I will make known my words to you.
001:024 Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched
        out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
001:025 but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;
001:026 I also will laugh at your disaster.  I will mock when
        calamity overtakes you;
001:027 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes
        on like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come on you.
001:028 Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.
        They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
001:029 because they hated knowledge, and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.
001:030 They wanted none of my counsel.  They despised all my reproof.
001:031 Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,
        and be filled with their own schemes.
001:032 For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
        The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
001:033 But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease,
        without fear of harm."
002:001 My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my
        commandments within you;
002:002 So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your
        heart to understanding;
002:003 Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your
        voice for understanding;
002:004 If you seek her as silver, and search for her as
        for hidden treasures:
002:005 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find
        the knowledge of God.
002:006 For Yahweh gives wisdom.  Out of his mouth comes
        knowledge and understanding.
002:007 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.  He is a shield
        to those who walk in integrity;
002:008 that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way
        of his saints.
002:009 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and
        every good path.
002:010 For wisdom will enter into your heart.  Knowledge will be
        pleasant to your soul.
002:011 Discretion will watch over you.  Understanding will keep you,
002:012 to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who
        speak perverse things;
002:013 who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
002:014 who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;
002:015 who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:
002:016 To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner
        who flatters with her words;
002:017 who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant
        of her God:
002:018 for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.
002:019 None who go to her return again, neither do they attain
        to the paths of life:
002:020 that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
        of the righteous.
002:021 For the upright will dwell in the land.  The perfect will
        remain in it.
002:022 But the wicked will be cut off from the land.  The treacherous
        will be rooted out of it.
003:001 My son, don't forget my teaching; but let your heart
        keep my commandments:
003:002 for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they
        add to you.
003:003 Don't let kindness and truth forsake you.  Bind them around
        your neck.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
003:004 So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight
        of God and man.
003:005 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don't lean on
        your own understanding.
003:006 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make
        your paths straight.
003:007 Don't be wise in your own eyes.  Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
003:008 It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.
003:009 Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits
        of all your increase:
003:010 so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will
        overflow with new wine.
003:011 My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, neither be weary
        of his reproof:
003:012 for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; even as a father reproves
        the son in whom he delights.
003:013 Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.
003:014 For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her
        return is better than fine gold.
003:015 She is more precious than rubies.  None of the things you can
        desire are to be compared to her.
003:016 Length of days is in her right hand.  In her left hand are
        riches and honor.
003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness.  All her paths are peace.
003:018 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.
        Happy is everyone who retains her.
003:019 By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.  By understanding,
        he established the heavens.
003:020 By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies
        drop down the dew.
003:021 My son, let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep sound
        wisdom and discretion:
003:022 so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.
003:023 Then you shall walk in your way securely.  Your foot won't stumble.
003:024 When you lie down, you will not be afraid.  Yes, you will lie down,
        and your sleep will be sweet.
003:025 Don't be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation
        of the wicked, when it comes:
003:026 for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot
        from being taken.
003:027 Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it
        is in the power of your hand to do it.
003:028 Don't say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again; tomorrow I
        will give it to you," when you have it by you.
003:029 Don't devise evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells
        securely by you.
003:030 Don't strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
003:031 Don't envy the man of violence.  Choose none of his ways.
003:032 For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship
        is with the upright.
003:033 Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses
        the habitation of the righteous.
003:034 Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.
003:035 The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion
        of fools.
004:001 Listen, sons, to a father's instruction.  Pay attention
        and know understanding;
004:002 for I give you sound learning.  Don't forsake my law.
004:003 For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child
        in the sight of my mother.
004:004 He taught me, and said to me:  "Let your heart retain my words.
        Keep my commandments, and live.
004:005 Get wisdom.  Get understanding.  Don't forget, neither swerve
        from the words of my mouth.
004:006 Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you.  Love her,
        and she will keep you.
004:007 Wisdom is supreme.  Get wisdom.  Yes, though it costs all
        your possessions, get understanding.
004:008 Esteem her, and she will exalt you.  She will bring you to honor,
        when you embrace her.
004:009 She will give to your head a garland of grace.  She will deliver
        a crown of splendor to you."
004:010 Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.  The years of your life
        will be many.
004:011 I have taught you in the way of wisdom.  I have led you
        in straight paths.
004:012 When you go, your steps will not be hampered.  When you run,
        you will not stumble.
004:013 Take firm hold of instruction.  Don't let her go.
        Keep her, for she is your life.
004:014 Don't enter into the path of the wicked.  Don't walk in the way
        of evil men.
004:015 Avoid it, and don't pass by it.  Turn from it, and pass on.
004:016 For they don't sleep, unless they do evil.  Their sleep is
        taken away, unless they make someone fall.
004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
004:018 But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,
        that shines more and more until the perfect day.
004:019 The way of the wicked is like darkness.  They don't know
        what they stumble over.
004:020 My son, attend to my words.  Turn your ear to my sayings.
004:021 Let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep them in the midst
        of your heart.
004:022 For they are life to those who find them, and health to
        their whole body.
004:023 Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the
        wellspring of life.
004:024 Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.  Put corrupt lips
        far from you.
004:025 Let your eyes look straight ahead.  Fix your gaze
        directly before you.
004:026 Make the path of your feet level.  Let all of your
        ways be established.
004:027 Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left.  Remove your
        foot from evil.
005:001 My son, pay attention to my wisdom.  Turn your ear
        to my understanding:
005:002 that you may maintain discretion, that your lips
        may preserve knowledge.
005:003 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.  Her mouth is
        smoother than oil,
005:004 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp
        as a two-edged sword.
005:005 Her feet go down to death.  Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
005:006 She gives no thought to the way of life.  Her ways are crooked,
        and she doesn't know it.
005:007 Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.  Don't depart from
        the words of my mouth.
005:008 Remove your way far from her.  Don't come near the door
        of her house,
005:009 lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;
005:010 lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich
        another man's house.
005:011 You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your
        body are consumed,
005:012 and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
005:013 neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned
        my ear to those who instructed me!
005:014 I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of
        the gathered assembly."
005:015 Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of
        your own well.
005:016 Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water
        in the public squares?
005:017 Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.
005:018 Let your spring be blessed.  Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
005:019 A loving doe and a graceful deer--let her breasts satisfy you
        at all times.  Be captivated always with her love.
005:020 For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
        Why embrace the bosom of another?
005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.
        He examines all his paths.
005:022 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.  The cords of his sin
        hold him firmly.
005:023 He will die for lack of instruction.  In the greatness of his folly,
        he will go astray.
006:001 My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,
        if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;
006:002 You are trapped by the words of your mouth.  You are ensnared
        with the words of your mouth.
006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, seeing you have
        come into the hand of your neighbor.  Go, humble yourself.
        Press your plea with your neighbor.
006:004 Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
006:005 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
        like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
006:006 Go to the ant, you sluggard.  Consider her ways, and be wise;
006:007 which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
006:008 provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food
        in the harvest.
006:009 How long will you sleep, sluggard?  When will you arise out
        of your sleep?
006:010 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:
006:011 so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity
        as an armed man.
006:012 A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with
        a perverse mouth;
006:013 who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions
        with his fingers;
006:014 in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually,
        who always sows discord.
006:015 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.  He will be
        broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
006:016 There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are
        an abomination to him:
006:017 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;
006:018 a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift
        in running to mischief,
006:019 a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows
        discord among brothers.
006:020 My son, keep your father's commandment, and don't forsake
        your mother's teaching.
006:021 Bind them continually on your heart.  Tie them around your neck.
006:022 When you walk, it will lead you.  When you sleep, it will watch
        over you.  When you awake, it will talk with you.
006:023 For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.
        Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
006:024 to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of
        the wayward wife's tongue.
006:025 Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her
        captivate you with her eyelids.
006:026 For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
        The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
006:027 Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?
006:028 Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
006:029 So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife.  Whoever touches
        her will not be unpunished.
006:030 Men don't despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself
        when he is hungry:
006:031 but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
        He shall give all the wealth of his house.
006:032 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
        He who does it destroys his own soul.
006:033 He will get wounds and dishonor.  His reproach will not
        be wiped away.
006:034 For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.  He won't spare
        in the day of vengeance.
006:035 He won't regard any ransom, neither will he rest content,
        though you give many gifts.
007:001 My son, keep my words.  Lay up my commandments within you.
007:002 Keep my commandments and live!  Guard my teaching as the apple
        of your eye.
007:003 Bind them on your fingers.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
007:004 Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."  Call understanding your relative,
007:005 that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner
        who flatters with her words.
007:006 For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.
007:007 I saw among the simple ones.  I discerned among the youths
        a young man void of understanding,
007:008 passing through the street near her corner, he went the way
        to her house,
007:009 in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle
        of the night and in the darkness.
007:010 Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,
        and with crafty intent.
007:011 She is loud and defiant.  Her feet don't stay in her house.
007:012 Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking
        at every corner.
007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him.  With an impudent face she
        said to him:
007:014 "Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.  This day I have
        paid my vows.
007:015 Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face,
        and I have found you.
007:016 I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped
        cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
007:018 Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning.
        Let's solace ourselves with loving.
007:019 For my husband isn't at home.  He has gone on a long journey.
007:020 He has taken a bag of money with him.  He will come home
        at the full moon."
007:021 With persuasive words, she led him astray.  With the flattering
        of her lips, she seduced him.
007:022 He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter,
        as a fool stepping into a noose.
007:023 Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries
        to the snare, and doesn't know that it will cost his life.
007:024 Now therefore, sons, listen to me.  Pay attention to the words
        of my mouth.
007:025 Don't let your heart turn to her ways.  Don't go astray
        in her paths,
007:026 for she has thrown down many wounded.  Yes, all her slain
        are a mighty army.
007:027 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
008:001 Doesn't wisdom cry out?  Doesn't understanding raise her voice?
008:002 On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet,
        she stands.
008:003 Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors,
        she cries aloud:
008:004 "To you men, I call!  I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
008:005 You simple, understand prudence.  You fools, be of
        an understanding heart.
008:006 Hear, for I will speak excellent things.  The opening of my
        lips is for right things.
008:007 For my mouth speaks truth.  Wickedness is an abomination
        to my lips.
008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
        There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
008:009 They are all plain to him who understands, right to those
        who find knowledge.
008:010 Receive my instruction rather than silver; knowledge rather
        than choice gold.
008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies.  All the things that may be
        desired can't be compared to it.
008:012 "I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.  Find out
        knowledge and discretion.
008:013 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.  I hate pride, arrogance,
        the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
008:014 Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.  I have understanding
        and power.
008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
008:016 By me princes rule; nobles, and all the righteous rulers
        of the earth.
008:017 I love those who love me.  Those who seek me diligently
        will find me.
008:018 With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity.
008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; my yield
        than choice silver.
008:020 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the
        paths of justice;
008:021 That I may give wealth to those who love me.
        I fill their treasuries.
008:022 "Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his
        deeds of old.
008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
        before the earth existed.
008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there
        were no springs abounding with water.
008:025 Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills,
        I was brought forth;
008:026 while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
        nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
008:027 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he set
        a circle on the surface of the deep,
008:028 when he established the clouds above, when the springs
        of the deep became strong,
008:029 when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not
        violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations
        of the earth;
008:030 then I was the craftsman by his side.  I was a delight day by day,
        always rejoicing before him,
008:031 Rejoicing in his whole world.  My delight was with the sons of men.
008:032 "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those
        who keep my ways.
008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise.  Don't refuse it.
008:034 Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates,
        waiting at my door posts.
008:035 For whoever finds me, finds life, and will obtain favor from Yahweh.
008:036 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.
        All those who hate me love death."
009:001 Wisdom has built her house.  She has carved out her seven pillars.
009:002 She has prepared her meat.  She has mixed her wine.
        She has also set her table.
009:003 She has sent out her maidens.  She cries from the highest
        places of the city:
009:004 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!"  As for him who is
        void of understanding, she says to him,
009:005 "Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which
        I have mixed!
009:006 Leave your simple ways, and live.  Walk in the way of understanding."
009:007 He who corrects a mocker invites insult.  He who reproves
        a wicked man invites abuse.
009:008 Don't reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.  Reprove a wise man,
        and he will love you.
009:009 Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser.
        Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
009:010 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.  The knowledge
        of the Holy One is understanding.
009:011 For by me your days will be multiplied.  The years of your life
        will be increased.
009:012 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.  If you mock,
        you alone will bear it.
009:013 The foolish woman is loud, Undisciplined, and knows nothing.
009:014 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places
        of the city,
009:015 To call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways,
009:016 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here."  as for him who is
        void of understanding, she says to him,
009:017 "Stolen water is sweet.  Food eaten in secret is pleasant."
009:018 But he doesn't know that the dead are there, that her guests
        are in the depths of Sheol.
010:001 The proverbs of Solomon.  A wise son makes a glad father;
        but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness
        delivers from death.
010:003 Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry,
        but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
010:004 He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, but the hand
        of the diligent brings wealth.
010:005 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps
        during the harvest is a son who causes shame.
010:006 Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but violence covers
        the mouth of the wicked.
010:007 The memory of the righteous is blessed, but the name of
        the wicked will rot.
010:008 The wise in heart accept commandments, but a chattering
        fool will fall.
010:009 He who walks blamelessly walks surely, but he who perverts
        his ways will be found out.
010:010 One winking with the eye causes sorrow, but a chattering
        fool will fall.
010:011 The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, but violence
        covers the mouth of the wicked.
010:012 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all wrongs.
010:013 Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,
        but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.
010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish
        is near ruin.
010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city.  The destruction
        of the poor is their poverty.
010:016 The labor of the righteous leads to life.  The increase
        of the wicked leads to sin.
010:017 He is in the way of life who heeds correction, but he who forsakes
        reproof leads others astray.
010:018 He who hides hatred has lying lips.  He who utters a slander
        is a fool.
010:019 In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience,
        but he who restrains his lips does wisely.
010:020 The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver.
        The heart of the wicked is of little worth.
010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many, but the foolish die
        for lack of understanding.
010:022 Yahweh's blessing brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it.
010:023 It is a fool's pleasure to do wickedness, but wisdom is a man
        of understanding's pleasure.
010:024 What the wicked fear, will overtake them, but the desire
        of the righteous will be granted.
010:025 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;
        but the righteous stand firm forever.
010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is
        the sluggard to those who send him.
010:027 The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, but the years of the wicked
        shall be shortened.
010:028 The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hope of the
        wicked will perish.
010:029 The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright, but it
        is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
010:030 The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not
        dwell in the land.
010:031 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but the perverse
        tongue will be cut off.
010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth
        of the wicked is perverse.
011:001 A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, but accurate
        weights are his delight.
011:002 When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom.
011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness
        of the treacherous shall destroy them.
011:004 Riches don't profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness
        delivers from death.
011:005 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,
        but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,
        but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.
011:007 When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, and expectation of power
        comes to nothing.
011:008 A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
        takes his place.
011:009 With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,
        but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.
011:010 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.
        When the wicked perish, there is shouting.
011:011 By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it
        is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
011:012 One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, but a man
        of understanding holds his peace.
011:013 One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, but one who is
        of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.
011:014 Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, but in
        the multitude of counselors there is victory.
011:015 He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,
        but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.
011:016 A gracious woman obtains honor, but violent men obtain riches.
011:017 The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel
        troubles his own flesh.
011:018 Wicked people earn deceitful wages, but one who sows righteousness
        reaps a sure reward.
011:019 He who is truly righteous gets life.  He who pursues
        evil gets death.
011:020 Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh,
        but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.
011:021 Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,
        but the seed of the righteous will be delivered.
011:022 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, is a beautiful woman
        who lacks discretion.
011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good.  The expectation
        of the wicked is wrath.
011:024 There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.
        There is one who withholds more than is appropriate,
        but gains poverty.
011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat.  He who waters shall
        be watered also himself.
011:026 People curse someone who withholds grain, but blessing will
        be on the head of him who sells it.
011:027 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but he who searches
        after evil, it shall come to him.
011:028 He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous shall
        flourish as the green leaf.
011:029 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.
        The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.  He who is
        wise wins souls.
011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth; how much
        more the wicked and the sinner!
012:001 Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates
        reproof is stupid.
012:002 A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh, but he will condemn
        a man of wicked devices.
012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root
        of the righteous shall not be moved.
012:004 A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but a disgraceful
        wife is as rottenness in his bones.
012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the advice
        of the wicked is deceitful.
012:006 The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,
        but the speech of the upright rescues them.
012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, but the house
        of the righteous shall stand.
012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, but he who has
        a warped mind shall be despised.
012:009 Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a servant,
        than he who honors himself, and lacks bread.
012:010 A righteous man regards the life of his animal, but the tender
        mercies of the wicked are cruel.
012:011 He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who
        chases fantasies is void of understanding.
012:012 The wicked desires the plunder of evil men, but the root
        of the righteous flourishes.
012:013 An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips, but the righteous
        shall come out of trouble.
012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth.
        The work of a man's hands shall be rewarded to him.
012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he who is wise
        listens to counsel.
012:016 A fool shows his annoyance the same day, but one who overlooks
        an insult is prudent.
012:017 He who is truthful testifies honestly, but a false witness lies.
012:018 There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,
        but the tongue of the wise heals.
012:019 Truth's lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue
        is only momentary.
012:020 Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, but joy comes
        to the promoters of peace.
012:021 No mischief shall happen to the righteous, but the wicked
        shall be filled with evil.
012:022 Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh, but those who do
        the truth are his delight.
012:023 A prudent man keeps his knowledge, but the hearts of
        fools proclaim foolishness.
012:024 The hands of the diligent ones shall rule, but laziness ends
        in slave labor.
012:025 Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, but a kind word
        makes it glad.
012:026 A righteous person is cautious in friendship, but the way
        of the wicked leads them astray.
012:027 The slothful man doesn't roast his game, but the possessions
        of diligent men are prized.
012:028 In the way of righteousness is life; in its path there
        is no death.
013:001 A wise son listens to his father's instruction, but a scoffer
        doesn't listen to rebuke.
013:002 By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things;
        but the unfaithful crave violence.
013:003 He who guards his mouth guards his soul.  One who opens wide
        his lips comes to ruin.
013:004 The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, but the desire
        of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.
013:005 A righteous man hates lies, but a wicked man brings
        shame and disgrace.
013:006 Righteousness guards the way of integrity, but wickedness
        overthrows the sinner.
013:007 There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.
        There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.
013:008 The ransom of a man's life is his riches, but the poor
        hear no threats.
013:009 The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp
        of the wicked is snuffed out.
013:010 Pride only breeds quarrels, but with ones who take advice is wisdom.
013:011 Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away, but he who gathers
        by hand makes it grow.
013:012 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when longing is fulfilled,
        it is a tree of life.
013:013 Whoever despises instruction will pay for it, but he who respects
        a command will be rewarded.
013:014 The teaching of the wise is a spring of life, to turn from
        the snares of death.
013:015 Good understanding wins favor; but the way of the unfaithful is hard.
013:016 Every prudent man acts from knowledge, but a fool exposes folly.
013:017 A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy
        envoy gains healing.
013:018 Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,
        but he who heeds correction shall be honored.
013:019 Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest
        turning from evil.
013:020 One who walks with wise men grows wise, but a companion
        of fools suffers harm.
013:021 Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous.
013:022 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children,
        but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.
013:023 An abundance of food is in poor people's fields, but injustice
        sweeps it away.
013:024 One who spares the rod hates his son, but one who loves him
        is careful to discipline him.
013:025 The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,
        but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.
014:001 Every wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears
        it down with her own hands.
014:002 He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh, but he who is
        perverse in his ways despises him.
014:003 The fool's talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips
        of the wise protect them.
014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, but much increase is
        by the strength of the ox.
014:005 A truthful witness will not lie, but a false witness
        pours out lies.
014:006 A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn't find it, but knowledge
        comes easily to a discerning person.
014:007 Stay away from a foolish man, for you won't find knowledge
        on his lips.
014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,
        but the folly of fools is deceit.
014:009 Fools mock at making atonement for sins, but among the upright
        there is good will.
014:010 The heart knows its own bitterness and joy; he will not share
        these with a stranger.
014:011 The house of the wicked will be overthrown, but the tent
        of the upright will flourish.
014:012 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it
        leads to death.
014:013 Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, and mirth may
        end in heaviness.
014:014 The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways; likewise a good
        man will be rewarded for his ways.
014:015 A simple man believes everything, but the prudent man carefully
        considers his ways.
014:016 A wise man fears, and shuns evil, but the fool is
        hotheaded and reckless.
014:017 He who is quick to become angry will commit folly, and a crafty
        man is hated.
014:018 The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
014:019 The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates
        of the righteous.
014:020 The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,
        but the rich person has many friends.
014:021 He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who has
        pity on the poor.
014:022 Don't they go astray who plot evil?  But love and faithfulness
        belong to those who plan good.
014:023 In all hard work there is profit, but the talk of the lips
        leads only to poverty.
014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches, but the folly of fools
        crowns them with folly.
014:025 A truthful witness saves souls, but a false witness is deceitful.
014:026 In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress, and he will be
        a refuge for his children.
014:027 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, turning people
        from the snares of death.
014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's glory, but in the lack
        of people is the destruction of the prince.
014:029 He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has
        a quick temper displays folly.
014:030 The life of the body is a heart at peace, but envy rots the bones.
014:031 He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,
        but he who is kind to the needy honors him.
014:032 The wicked is brought down in his calamity, but in death,
        the righteous has a refuge.
014:033 Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,
        and is even made known in the inward part of fools.
014:034 Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.
014:035 The king's favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,
        but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.
015:001 A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
015:002 The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth
        of fools gush out folly.
015:003 Yahweh's eyes are everywhere, keeping watch on the evil
        and the good.
015:004 A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but deceit in it
        crushes the spirit.
015:005 A fool despises his father's correction, but he who heeds
        reproof shows prudence.
015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but the income
        of the wicked brings trouble.
015:007 The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so with the
        heart of fools.
015:008 The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh,
        but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but he loves
        him who follows after righteousness.
015:010 There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way:
        whoever hates reproof shall die.
015:011 Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh--how much more then
        the hearts of the children of men!
015:012 A scoffer doesn't love to be reproved; he will not go to the wise.
015:013 A glad heart makes a cheerful face; but an aching heart
        breaks the spirit.
015:014 The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,
        but the mouths of fools feed on folly.
015:015 All the days of the afflicted are wretched, but one who has
        a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
015:016 Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, than great
        treasure with trouble.
015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a fattened
        calf with hatred.
015:018 A wrathful man stirs up contention, but one who is slow
        to anger appeases strife.
015:019 The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, but the path
        of the upright is a highway.
015:020 A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man
        despises his mother.
015:021 Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, but a man of
        understanding keeps his way straight.
015:022 Where there is no counsel, plans fail; but in a multitude
        of counselors they are established.
015:023 Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.
        How good is a word at the right time!
015:024 The path of life leads upward for the wise, to keep him from
        going downward to Sheol.
015:025 Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, but he will keep
        the widow's borders intact.
015:026 Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the thoughts
        of the pure are pleasing.
015:027 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who
        hates bribes will live.
015:028 The heart of the righteous weighs answers, but the mouth
        of the wicked gushes out evil.
015:029 Yahweh is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer
        of the righteous.
015:030 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.  Good news gives
        health to the bones.
015:031 The ear that listens to reproof lives, and will be at home
        among the wise.
015:032 He who refuses correction despises his own soul, but he who
        listens to reproof gets understanding.
015:033 The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom.  Before honor is humility.
016:001 The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue
        is from Yahweh.
016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but Yahweh
        weighs the motives.
016:003 Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed.
016:004 Yahweh has made everything for its own end--yes, even the wicked
        for the day of evil.
016:005 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh:
        they shall certainly not be unpunished.
016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.  By the fear
        of Yahweh men depart from evil.
016:007 When a man's ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies
        to be at peace with him.
016:008 Better is a little with righteousness, than great
        revenues with injustice.
016:009 A man's heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps.
016:010 Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.
        He shall not betray his mouth.
016:011 Honest balances and scales are Yahweh's; all the weights
        in the bag are his work.
016:012 It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne
        is established by righteousness.
016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings.  They value one who
        speaks the truth.
016:014 The king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man
        will pacify it.
016:015 In the light of the king's face is life.  His favor is like
        a cloud of the spring rain.
016:016 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!  Yes, to get
        understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.
        He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
016:018 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
016:019 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to
        divide the plunder with the proud.
016:020 He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.  Whoever trusts
        in Yahweh is blessed.
016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent.  Pleasantness of
        the lips promotes instruction.
016:022 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,
        but the punishment of fools is their folly.
016:023 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning
        to his lips.
016:024 Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health
        to the bones.
016:025 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it
        leads to death.
016:026 The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; for his mouth
        urges him on.
016:027 A worthless man devises mischief.  His speech is like
        a scorching fire.
016:028 A perverse man stirs up strife.  A whisperer separates close friends.
016:029 A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way
        that is not good.
016:030 One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses
        his lips, is bent on evil.
016:031 Gray hair is a crown of glory.  It is attained by a
        life of righteousness.
016:032 One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
        one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.
016:033 The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision
        is from Yahweh.
017:001 Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full
        of feasting with strife.
017:002 A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,
        and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.
017:003 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
        but Yahweh tests the hearts.
017:004 An evil-doer heeds wicked lips.  A liar gives ear to
        a mischievous tongue.
017:005 Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.  He who is glad
        at calamity shall not be unpunished.
017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; the glory
        of children are their parents.
017:007 Arrogant speech isn't fitting for a fool, much less do lying
        lips fit a prince.
017:008 A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;
        wherever he turns, he prospers.
017:009 He who covers an offense promotes love; but he who repeats
        a matter separates best friends.
017:010 A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding than
        a hundred lashes into a fool.
017:011 An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger
        shall be sent against him.
017:012 Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, rather than a fool
        in his folly.
017:013 Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart
        from his house.
017:014 The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop
        contention before quarreling breaks out.
017:015 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous,
        both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.
017:016 Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
        seeing he has no understanding?
017:017 A friend loves at all times; and a brother is born for adversity.
017:018 A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral
        in the presence of his neighbor.
017:019 He who loves disobedience loves strife.  One who builds a high
        gate seeks destruction.
017:020 One who has a perverse heart doesn't find prosperity,
        and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.
017:021 He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.  The father
        of a fool has no joy.
017:022 A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a crushed spirit
        dries up the bones.
017:023 A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert
        the ways of justice.
017:024 Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,
        but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.
017:025 A foolish son brings grief to his father, and bitterness
        to her who bore him.
017:026 Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to flog officials
        for their integrity.
017:027 He who spares his words has knowledge.  He who is even tempered
        is a man of understanding.
017:028 Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.
        When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
018:001 An unfriendly man pursues selfishness, and defies all sound judgment.
018:002 A fool has no delight in understanding, but only in revealing
        his own opinion.
018:003 When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with
        shame comes disgrace.
018:004 The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters.
        The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
018:005 To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,
        nor to deprive the innocent of justice.
018:006 A fool's lips come into strife, and his mouth invites beatings.
018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are a snare
        to his soul.
018:008 The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:  they go down
        into a person's innermost parts.
018:009 One who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a
        master of destruction.
018:010 The name of Yahweh is a strong tower:  the righteous run to him,
        and are safe.
018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable
        wall in his own imagination.
018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is proud, but before
        honor is humility.
018:013 He who gives answer before he hears, that is folly and
        shame to him.
018:014 A man's spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit,
        who can bear?
018:015 The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.  The ear of
        the wise seeks knowledge.
018:016 A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.
018:017 He who pleads his cause first seems right; until another comes
        and questions him.
018:018 The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart.
018:019 A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city;
        and disputes are like the bars of a castle.
018:020 A man's stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.
        With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love
        it will eat its fruit.
018:022 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains
        favor of Yahweh.
018:023 The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.
018:024 A man of many companions may be ruined, but there is a friend
        who sticks closer than a brother.
019:001 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is
        perverse in his lips and is a fool.
019:002 It isn't good to have zeal without knowledge; nor being hasty
        with one's feet and missing the way.
019:003 The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart
        rages against Yahweh.
019:004 Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend.
019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who pours out lies
        shall not go free.
019:006 Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend
        to a man who gives gifts.
019:007 All the relatives of the poor shun him:  how much more
        do his friends avoid him!  He pursues them with pleas,
        but they are gone.
019:008 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.  He who keeps understanding
        shall find good.
019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who utters
        lies shall perish.
019:010 Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less
        for a servant to have rule over princes.
019:011 The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.
        It is his glory to overlook an offense.
019:012 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor
        is like dew on the grass.
019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father.  A wife's quarrels
        are a continual dripping.
019:014 House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent
        wife is from Yahweh.
019:015 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.  The idle soul
        shall suffer hunger.
019:016 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is
        contemptuous in his ways shall die.
019:017 He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him.
019:018 Discipline your son, for there is hope; don't be a willing
        party to his death.
019:019 A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him,
        you must do it again.
019:020 Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise
        in your latter end.
019:021 There are many plans in a man's heart, but Yahweh's
        counsel will prevail.
019:022 That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.
        A poor man is better than a liar.
019:023 The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests
        and will not be touched by trouble.
019:024 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much
        as bring it to his mouth again.
019:025 Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
        rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
019:026 He who robs his father and drives away his mother, is a son
        who causes shame and brings reproach.
019:027 If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray
        from the words of knowledge.
019:028 A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked
        gulps down iniquity.
019:029 Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the
        backs of fools.
020:001 Wine is a mocker, and beer is a brawler.  Whoever is led astray
        by them is not wise.
020:002 The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.
        He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.
020:003 It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; but every
        fool will be quarreling.
020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;
        therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man
        of understanding will draw it out.
020:006 Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find
        a faithful man?
020:007 A righteous man walks in integrity.  Blessed are his
        children after him.
020:008 A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all
        evil with his eyes.
020:009 Who can say, "I have made my heart pure.  I am clean
        and without sin?"
020:010 Differing weights and differing measures, both of them alike
        are an abomination to Yahweh.
020:011 Even a child makes himself known by his doings, whether his
        work is pure, and whether it is right.
020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even
        both of them.
020:013 Don't love sleep, lest you come to poverty.  Open your eyes,
        and you shall be satisfied with bread.
020:014 "It's no good, it's no good," says the buyer; but when he is
        gone his way, then he boasts.
020:015 There is gold and abundance of rubies; but the lips of knowledge
        are a rare jewel.
020:016 Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;
        and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.
020:017 Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth
        is filled with gravel.
020:018 Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war!
020:019 He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;
        therefore don't keep company with him who opens wide his lips.
020:020 Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
        out in blackness of darkness.
020:021 An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning, won't be blessed
        in the end.
020:022 Don't say, "I will pay back evil."  Wait for Yahweh,
        and he will save you.
020:023 Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales
        are not pleasing.
020:024 A man's steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way?
020:025 It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later
        to consider his vows.
020:026 A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing
        wheel over them.
020:027 The spirit of man is Yahweh's lamp, searching all
        his innermost parts.
020:028 Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.  His throne is
        sustained by love.
020:029 The glory of young men is their strength.  The splendor of old
        men is their gray hair.
020:030 Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge
        the innermost parts.
021:001 The king's heart is in Yahweh's hand like the watercourses.
        He turns it wherever he desires.
021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh
        weighs the hearts.
021:003 To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to
        Yahweh than sacrifice.
021:004 A high look, and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
021:005 The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone
        who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.
021:006 Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor
        for those who seek death.
021:007 The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they
        refuse to do what is right.
021:008 The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the
        innocent is upright.
021:009 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
        than to share a house with a contentious woman.
021:010 The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy
        in his eyes.
021:011 When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.
        When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
021:012 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings
        the wicked to ruin.
021:013 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out,
        but shall not be heard.
021:014 A gift in secret pacifies anger; and a bribe in the cloak,
        strong wrath.
021:015 It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction
        to the workers of iniquity.
021:016 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest
        in the assembly of the dead.
021:017 He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man.  He who loves wine
        and oil shall not be rich.
021:018 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; the treacherous
        for the upright.
021:019 It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious
        and fretful woman.
021:020 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
        but a foolish man swallows it up.
021:021 He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life,
        righteousness, and honor.
021:022 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down
        the strength of its confidence.
021:023 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
021:024 The proud and haughty man, "scoffer" is his name; he works
        in the arrogance of pride.
021:025 The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.
021:026 There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous
        give and don't withhold.
021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination:  how much more,
        when he brings it with a wicked mind!
021:028 A false witness will perish, and a man who listens
        speaks to eternity.
021:029 A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright,
        he establishes his ways.
021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh.
021:031 The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory
        is with Yahweh.
022:001 A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving
        favor is better than silver and gold.
022:002 The rich and the poor have this in common:  Yahweh is the maker
        of them all.
022:003 A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself; but the simple
        pass on, and suffer for it.
022:004 The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth,
        honor, and life.
022:005 Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:
        whoever guards his soul stays from them.
022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old
        he will not depart from it.
022:007 The rich rule over the poor.  The borrower is servant
        to the lender.
022:008 He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury
        will be destroyed.
022:009 He who has a generous eye will be blessed; for he shares his
        food with the poor.
022:010 Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and
        insults will stop.
022:011 He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is
        the king's friend.
022:012 The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge; but he frustrates
        the words of the unfaithful.
022:013 The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside!  I will be killed
        in the streets!"
022:014 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit:  he who is under
        Yahweh's wrath will fall into it.
022:015 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:  the rod of discipline
        drives it far from him.
022:016 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever
        gives to the rich, both come to poverty.
022:017 Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.
        Apply your heart to my teaching.
022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,
        if all of them are ready on your lips.
022:019 That your trust may be in Yahweh, I teach you today, even you.
022:020 Haven't I written to you thirty excellent things of
        counsel and knowledge,
022:021 To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers
        to the ones who sent you?
022:022 Don't exploit the poor, because he is poor; and don't crush
        the needy in court;
022:023 for Yahweh will plead their case, and plunder the life
        of those who plunder them.
022:024 Don't befriend a hot-tempered man, and don't associate with one
        who harbors anger:
022:025 lest you learn his ways, and ensnare your soul.
022:026 Don't you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are
        collateral for debts.
022:027 If you don't have means to pay, why should he take away your
        bed from under you?
022:028 Don't move the ancient boundary stone, which your fathers
        have set up.
022:029 Do you see a man skilled in his work?  He will serve kings.
        He won't serve obscure men.
023:001 When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what
        is before you;
023:002 put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite.
023:003 Don't be desirous of his dainties, seeing they are deceitful food.
023:004 Don't weary yourself to be rich.  In your wisdom, show restraint.
023:005 Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?  For it certainly
        sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
023:006 Don't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don't
        crave his delicacies:
023:007 for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.  "Eat and drink!"
        he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
023:008 The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose
        your good words.
023:009 Don't speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom
        of your words.
023:010 Don't move the ancient boundary stone.  Don't encroach on
        the fields of the fatherless:
023:011 for their Defender is strong.  He will plead their case against you.
023:012 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the
        words of knowledge.
023:013 Don't withhold correction from a child.  If you punish him
        with the rod, he will not die.
023:014 Punish him with the rod, and save his soul from Sheol.
023:015 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine:
023:016 yes, my heart will rejoice, when your lips speak what is right.
023:017 Don't let your heart envy sinners; but rather fear Yahweh
        all the day long.
023:018 Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not
        be cut off.
023:019 Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path!
023:020 Don't be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge
        themselves on meat:
023:021 for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;
        and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
023:022 Listen to your father who gave you life, and don't despise
        your mother when she is old.
023:023 Buy the truth, and don't sell it.  Get wisdom, discipline,
        and understanding.
023:024 The father of the righteous has great joy.  Whoever fathers
        a wise child delights in him.
023:025 Let your father and your mother be glad!  Let her who
        bore you rejoice!
023:026 My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways.
023:027 For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is
        a narrow well.
023:028 Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the
        unfaithful among men.
023:029 Who has woe?  Who has sorrow?  Who has strife?  Who has complaints?
        Who has needless bruises?  Who has bloodshot eyes?
023:030 Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek
        out mixed wine.
023:031 Don't look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup,
        when it goes down smoothly.
023:032 In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper.
023:033 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will
        imagine confusing things.
023:034 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,
        or as he who lies on top of the rigging:
023:035 "They hit me, and I was not hurt!  They beat me, and I
        don't feel it!  When will I wake up?  I can do it again.
        I can find another."
024:001 Don't be envious of evil men; neither desire to be with them:
024:002 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about mischief.
024:003 Through wisdom a house is built; by understanding it is established;
024:004 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare
        and beautiful treasure.
024:005 A wise man has great power; and a knowledgeable
        man increases strength;
024:006 for by wise guidance you wage your war; and victory is
        in many advisors.
024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool:  he doesn't open his mouth
        in the gate.
024:008 One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer.
024:009 The schemes of folly are sin.  The mocker is detested by men.
024:010 If you falter in the time of trouble, your strength is small.
024:011 Rescue those who are being led away to death!  Indeed, hold back
        those who are staggering to the slaughter!
024:012 If you say, "Behold, we didn't know this;" doesn't he who weighs
        the hearts consider it?  He who keeps your soul, doesn't he know it?
        Shall he not render to every man according to his work?
024:013 My son, eat honey, for it is good; the droppings of the honeycomb,
        which are sweet to your taste:
024:014 so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; if you have found it,
        then there will be a reward, your hope will not be cut off.
024:015 Don't lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of
        the righteous.  Don't destroy his resting place:
024:016 for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again;
        but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
024:017 Don't rejoice when your enemy falls.  Don't let your heart
        be glad when he is overthrown;
024:018 lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
        his wrath from him.
024:019 Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; neither be envious
        of the wicked:
024:020 for there will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp
        of the wicked shall be snuffed out.
024:021 My son, fear Yahweh and the king.  Don't join those
        who are rebellious:
024:022 for their calamity will rise suddenly; the destruction from
        them both--who knows?
024:023 These also are sayings of the wise.  To show partiality
        in judgment is not good.
024:024 He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;" peoples shall
        curse him, and nations shall abhor him--
024:025 but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
        and a rich blessing will come on them.
024:026 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
024:027 Prepare your work outside, and get your fields ready.
        Afterwards, build your house.
024:028 Don't be a witness against your neighbor without cause.
        Don't deceive with your lips.
024:029 Don't say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render
        to the man according to his work."
024:030 I went by the field of the sluggard, by the vineyard of the man
        void of understanding;
024:031 Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.  Its surface was
        covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
024:032 Then I saw, and considered well.  I saw, and received instruction:
024:033 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep;
024:034 so shall your poverty come as a robber, and your want as
        an armed man.
025:001 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
        king of Judah copied out.
025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the glory
        of kings is to search out a matter.
025:003 As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the hearts
        of kings are unsearchable.
025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and material comes out
        for the refiner;
025:005 Take away the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne
        will be established in righteousness.
025:006 Don't exalt yourself in the presence of the king, or claim
        a place among great men;
025:007 for it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here,"
        than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,
        whom your eyes have seen.
025:008 Don't be hasty in bringing charges to court.  What will you
        do in the end when your neighbor shames you?
025:009 Debate your case with your neighbor, and don't betray
        the confidence of another;
025:010 lest one who hears it put you to shame, and your bad
        reputation never depart.
025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
        so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.
025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
        messenger to those who send him; for he refreshes the soul
        of his masters.
025:014 As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts
        of gifts deceptively.
025:015 By patience a ruler is persuaded.  A soft tongue breaks the bone.
025:016 Have you found honey?  Eat as much as is sufficient for you,
        lest you eat too much, and vomit it.
025:017 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, lest he be
        weary of you, and hate you.
025:018 A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor is like a club,
        a sword, or a sharp arrow.
025:019 Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble is like
        a bad tooth, or a lame foot.
025:020 As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, or vinegar
        on soda, so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
025:021 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.  If he is thirsty,
        give him water to drink:
025:022 for you will heap coals of fire on his head, and Yahweh
        will reward you.
025:023 The north wind brings forth rain:  so a backbiting tongue
        brings an angry face.
025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
        than to share a house with a contentious woman.
025:025 Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from
        a far country.
025:026 Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well, so is a righteous
        man who gives way before the wicked.
025:027 It is not good to eat much honey; nor is it honorable to seek
        one's own honor.
025:028 Like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man
        whose spirit is without restraint.
026:001 Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not
        fitting for a fool.
026:002 Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting swallow,
        so the undeserved curse doesn't come to rest.
026:003 A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod
        for the back of fools!
026:004 Don't answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also
        be like him.
026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in
        his own eyes.
026:006 One who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off
        feet and drinking violence.
026:007 Like the legs of the lame that hang loose:  so is a parable
        in the mouth of fools.
026:008 As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor
        to a fool.
026:009 Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
        so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
026:010 As an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool
        or he who hires those who pass by.
026:011 As a dog that returns to his vomit, so is a fool who
        repeats his folly.
026:012 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?  There is more hope
        for a fool than for him.
026:013 The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!
        A fierce lion roams the streets!"
026:014 As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.
026:015 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.  He is too lazy
        to bring it back to his mouth.
026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who
        answer with discretion.
026:017 Like one who grabs a dog's ears is one who passes by and meddles
        in a quarrel not his own.
026:018 Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,
026:019 is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not joking?"
026:020 For lack of wood a fire goes out.  Without gossip,
        a quarrel dies down.
026:021 As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious
        man to kindling strife.
026:022 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, they go down
        into the innermost parts.
026:023 Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent
        one with an evil heart.
026:024 A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but he harbors
        evil in his heart.
026:025 When his speech is charming, don't believe him; for there
        are seven abominations in his heart.
026:026 His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness
        will be exposed in the assembly.
026:027 Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.  Whoever rolls a stone,
        it will come back on him.
026:028 A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a flattering
        mouth works ruin.
027:001 Don't boast about tomorrow; for you don't know what a day
        may bring forth.
027:002 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger,
        and not your own lips.
027:003 A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool's provocation
        is heavier than both.
027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able
        to stand before jealousy?
027:005 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; although the kisses
        of an enemy are profuse.
027:007 A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul,
        every bitter thing is sweet.
027:008 As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders
        from his home.
027:009 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest
        counsel from a man's friend.
027:010 Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend.
        Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster:
        better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.
027:011 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can
        answer my tormentor.
027:012 A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple
        pass on, and suffer for it.
027:013 Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.
        Hold it for a wayward woman!
027:014 He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
        it will be taken as a curse by him.
027:015 A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious
        wife are alike:
027:016 restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping
        oil in his right hand.
027:017 Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend's countenance.
027:018 Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.
        He who looks after his master shall be honored.
027:019 As water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man.
027:020 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man's eyes
        are never satisfied.
027:021 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
        but man is refined by his praise.
027:022 Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
        yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
027:023 Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention
        to your herds:
027:024 for riches are not forever, nor does even the crown endure
        to all generations.
027:025 The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses
        of the hills are gathered in.
027:026 The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price
        of a field.
027:027 There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, for your
        family's food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
028:001 The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the righteous are
        as bold as a lion.
028:002 In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained
        by a man of understanding and knowledge.
028:003 A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain
        which leaves no crops.
028:004 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep
        the law contend with them.
028:005 Evil men don't understand justice; but those who seek Yahweh
        understand it fully.
028:006 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than he who is
        perverse in his ways, and he is rich.
028:007 Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he who is a companion
        of gluttons shames his father.
028:008 He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it
        for one who has pity on the poor.
028:009 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
        is an abomination.
028:010 Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he will
        fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.
028:011 The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has
        understanding sees through him.
028:012 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when
        the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
028:013 He who conceals his sins doesn't prosper, but whoever confesses
        and renounces them finds mercy.
028:014 Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his
        heart falls into trouble.
028:015 As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler
        over helpless people.
028:016 A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.  One who hates ill-gotten
        gain will have long days.
028:017 A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death;
        no one will support him.
028:018 Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse
        ways will fall suddenly.
028:019 One who works his land will have an abundance of food;
        but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
028:020 A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager
        to be rich will not go unpunished.
028:021 To show partiality is not good; yet a man will do wrong
        for a piece of bread.
028:022 A stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn't know that poverty
        waits for him.
028:023 One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one
        who flatters with the tongue.
028:024 Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, "It's not wrong."
        He is a partner with a destroyer.
028:025 One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in
        Yahweh will prosper.
028:026 One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom
        is kept safe.
028:027 One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes
        his eyes will have many curses.
028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish,
        the righteous thrive.
029:001 He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be
        destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.
029:002 When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; but when
        the wicked rule, the people groan.
029:003 Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; but a companion
        of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
029:004 The king by justice makes the land stable, but he who takes
        bribes tears it down.
029:005 A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
029:006 An evil man is snared by his sin, but the righteous can sing
        and be glad.
029:007 The righteous care about justice for the poor.  The wicked
        aren't concerned about knowledge.
029:008 Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.
029:009 If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages
        or scoffs, and there is no peace.
029:010 The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life
        of the upright.
029:011 A fool vents all of his anger, but a wise man brings
        himself under control.
029:012 If a ruler listens to lies, all of his officials are wicked.
029:013 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
        Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.
029:014 The king who fairly judges the poor, his throne shall
        be established forever.
029:015 The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself
        causes shame to his mother.
029:016 When the wicked increase, sin increases; but the righteous
        will see their downfall.
029:017 Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring
        delight to your soul.
029:018 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
        but one who keeps the law is blessed.
029:019 A servant can't be corrected by words.  Though he understands,
        yet he will not respond.
029:020 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?  There is more hope
        for a fool than for him.
029:021 He who pampers his servant from youth will have him become
        a son in the end.
029:022 An angry man stirs up strife, and a wrathful man abounds in sin.
029:023 A man's pride brings him low, but one of lowly spirit gains honor.
029:024 Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.
        He takes an oath, but dares not testify.
029:025 The fear of man proves to be a snare, but whoever puts his trust
        in Yahweh is kept safe.
029:026 Many seek the ruler's favor, but a man's justice comes from Yahweh.
029:027 A dishonest man detests the righteous, and the upright in their
        ways detest the wicked.
030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle:
        the man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
030:002 "Surely I am the most ignorant man, and don't have
        a man's understanding.
030:003 I have not learned wisdom, neither do I have the knowledge
        of the Holy One.
030:004 Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?  Who has
        gathered the wind in his fists?  Who has bound the waters
        in his garment?  Who has established all the ends of the earth?
        What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?
030:005 "Every word of God is flawless.  He is a shield to those who take
        refuge in him.
030:006 Don't you add to his words, lest he reprove you, and you
        be found a liar.
030:007 "Two things I have asked of you; don't deny me before I die:
030:008 Remove far from me falsehood and lies.  Give me neither poverty
        nor riches.  Feed me with the food that is needful for me;
030:009 lest I be full, deny you, and say, 'Who is Yahweh?' or lest
        I be poor, and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.
030:010 "Don't slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you,
        and you be held guilty.
030:011 There is a generation that curses their father, and doesn't
        bless their mother.
030:012 There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,
        yet are not washed from their filthiness.
030:013 There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
        Their eyelids are lifted up.
030:014 There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, and their
        jaws like knives, to devour the poor from the earth,
        and the needy from among men.
030:015 "The leach has two daughters:  'Give, give.'  "There are three
        things that are never satisfied; four that don't say, 'Enough:'
030:016 Sheol, the barren womb; the earth that is not satisfied with water;
        and the fire that doesn't say, 'Enough.'
030:017 "The eye that mocks at his father, and scorns obedience
        to his mother:  the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
        the young eagles shall eat it.
030:018 "There are three things which are too amazing for me,
        four which I don't understand:
030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock;
        the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man
        with a maiden.
030:020 "So is the way of an adulterous woman:  she eats and wipes
        her mouth, and says, 'I have done nothing wrong.'
030:021 "For three things the earth tremble, and under four,
        it can't bear up:
030:022 For a servant when he is king; a fool when he is filled with food;
030:023 for an unloved woman when she is married; and a handmaid
        who is heir to her mistress.
030:024 "There are four things which are little on the earth,
        but they are exceedingly wise:
030:025 the ants are not a strong people, yet they provide their food
        in the summer.
030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
        in the rocks.
030:027 The locusts have no king, yet they advance in ranks.
030:028 You can catch a lizard with your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.
030:029 "There are three things which are stately in their march,
        four which are stately in going:
030:030 The lion, which is mightiest among animals, and doesn't turn
        away for any;
030:031 the greyhound, the male goat also; and the king against whom
        there is no rising up.
030:032 "If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you
        have thought evil, put your hand over your mouth.
030:033 For as the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing
        of the nose brings forth blood; so the forcing of wrath
        brings forth strife."
031:001 The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
031:002 "Oh, my son!  Oh, son of my womb!  Oh, son of my vows!
031:003 Don't give your strength to women, nor your ways to that
        which destroys kings.
031:004 It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine;
        nor for princes to say, 'Where is strong drink?'
031:005 lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice
        due to anyone who is afflicted.
031:006 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine
        to the bitter in soul:
031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his
        misery no more.
031:008 Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who
        are left desolate.
031:009 Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to
        the poor and needy."
031:010 {Proverbs 31:10-31 form an acrostic, with each verse starting
        with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order.}Who can
        find a worthy woman?  For her price is far above rubies.
031:011 The heart of her husband trusts in her.  He shall have no
        lack of gain.
031:012 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.
031:013 She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.
031:014 She is like the merchant ships.  She brings her bread from afar.
031:015 She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household,
        and portions for her servant girls.
031:016 She considers a field, and buys it.  With the fruit of her hands,
        she plants a vineyard.
031:017 She girds her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.
031:018 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
        Her lamp doesn't go out by night.
031:019 She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
031:020 She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands
        to the needy.
031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her
        household are clothed with scarlet.
031:022 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.  Her clothing
        is fine linen and purple.
031:023 Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among
        the elders of the land.
031:024 She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes
        to the merchant.
031:025 Strength and dignity are her clothing.  She laughs at
        the time to come.
031:026 She opens her mouth with wisdom.  Faithful instruction is
        on her tongue.
031:027 She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn't eat
        the bread of idleness.
031:028 Her children rise up and call her blessed.  Her husband
        also praises her:
031:029 "Many women do noble things, but you excel them all."
031:030 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh,
        she shall be praised.
031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands!  Let her works praise
        her in the gates!
Book 21 Ecclesiastes
001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
001:002 "Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities,
        all is vanity."
001:003 What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors
        under the sun?
001:004 One generation goes, and another generation comes;
        but the earth remains forever.
001:005 The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its
        place where it rises.
001:006 The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north.
        It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns
        again to its courses.
001:007 All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full.
        To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.
001:008 All things are full of weariness beyond uttering.  The eye is
        not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
001:009 That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has
        been done is that which shall be done:  and there is no new
        thing under the sun.
001:010 Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?"
        It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
001:011 There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any
        memory of the latter that are to come, among those that
        shall come after.
001:012 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
001:013 I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning
        all that is done under the sky.  It is a heavy burden that God
        has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun;
        and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
001:015 That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is
        lacking can't be counted.
001:016 I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself
        great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem.
        Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
001:017 I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly.
        I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.
001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases
        knowledge increases sorrow.
002:001 I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth:
        therefore enjoy pleasure;" and behold, this also was vanity.
002:002 I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth,
        "What does it accomplish?"
002:003 I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart
        yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly,
        until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they
        should do under heaven all the days of their lives.
002:004 I made myself great works.  I built myself houses.
        I planted myself vineyards.
002:005 I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them
        of all kinds of fruit.
002:006 I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest
        where trees were reared.
002:007 I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born
        in my house.  I also had great possessions of herds and flocks,
        above all who were before me in Jerusalem;
002:008 I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings
        and of the provinces.  I got myself male and female singers,
        and the delights of the sons of men--musical instruments,
        and that of all sorts.
002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me
        in Jerusalem.  My wisdom also remained with me.
002:010 Whatever my eyes desired, I didn't keep from them.
        I didn't withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart
        rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion
        from all my labor.
002:011 Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked,
        and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold,
        all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no
        profit under the sun.
002:012 I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly:
        for what can the king's successor do?  Just that which has
        been done long ago.
002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness--
        and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.
002:015 Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool,
        so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?"
        Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.
002:016 For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory
        for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have
        been long forgotten.  Indeed, the wise man must die just
        like the fool!
002:017 So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun
        was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
002:018 I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun,
        seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
002:019 Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool?
        Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored,
        and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun.
        This also is vanity.
002:020 Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning
        all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.
002:021 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge,
        and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion
        to a man who has not labored for it.  This also is vanity
        and a great evil.
002:022 For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving
        of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?
002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief;
        yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest.
        This also is vanity.
002:024 There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat
        and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor.
        This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
002:025 For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
002:026 For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge,
        and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather
        and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God.
        This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
003:001 For everything there is a season, and a time for every
        purpose under heaven:
003:002 a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant,
        and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
003:003 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down,
        and a time to build up;
003:004 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn,
        and a time to dance;
003:005 a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
        a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
003:006 a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
        to cast away;
003:007 a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence,
        and a time to speak;
003:008 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war,
        and a time for peace.
003:009 What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?
003:010 I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men
        to be afflicted with.
003:011 He has made everything beautiful in its time.  He has also set
        eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can't find out the work
        that God has done from the beginning even to the end.
003:012 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice,
        and to do good as long as they live.
003:013 Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all
        his labor, is the gift of God.
003:014 I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever.
        Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it;
        and God has done it, that men should fear before him.
003:015 That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has
        been long ago:  and God seeks again that which is passed away.
003:016 Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice,
        that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness,
        that wickedness was there.
003:017 I said in my heart, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked;
        for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work."
003:018 I said in my heart, "As for the sons of men, God tests them,
        so that they may see that they themselves are like animals.
003:019 For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals.
        Even one thing happens to them.  As the one dies,
        so the other dies.  Yes, they have all one breath; and man
        has no advantage over the animals:  for all is vanity.
003:020 All go to one place.  All are from the dust, and all turn
        to dust again.
003:021 Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward,
        and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward
        to the earth?"
003:022 Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man
        should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion:
        for who can bring him to see what will be after him?
004:001 Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under
        the sun:  and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed,
        and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors
        there was power; but they had no comforter.
004:002 Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than
        the living who are yet alive.
004:003 Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been,
        who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
004:004 Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a
        man's neighbor.  This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
004:005 The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.
004:006 Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor
        and chasing after wind.
004:007 Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
004:008 There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother.
        There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes
        satisfied with wealth.  For whom then, do I labor, and deprive
        my soul of enjoyment?  This also is vanity, yes, it is
        a miserable business.
004:009 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward
        for their labor.
004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe
        to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn't have another
        to lift him up.
004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can
        one keep warm alone?
004:012 If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him;
        and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
004:013 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king
        who doesn't know how to receive admonition any more.
004:014 For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his
        kingdom he was born poor.
004:015 I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were
        with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.
004:016 There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom
        he was--yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him.
        Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
005:001 Guard your steps when you go to God's house; for to draw near
        to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools,
        for they don't know that they do evil.
005:002 Don't be rash with your mouth, and don't let your heart be
        hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven,
        and you on earth.  Therefore let your words be few.
005:003 For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool's
        speech with a multitude of words.
005:004 When you vow a vow to God, don't defer to pay it; for he has
        no pleasure in fools.  Pay that which you vow.
005:005 It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow
        and not pay.
005:006 Don't allow your mouth to lead you into sin.
        Don't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake.
        Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work
        of your hands?
005:007 For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well
        as in many words:  but you must fear God.
005:008 If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking
        away of justice and righteousness in a district, don't marvel
        at the matter:  for one official is eyed by a higher one;
        and there are officials over them.
005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all.  The king profits
        from the field.
005:010 He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
        nor he who loves abundance, with increase:  this also is vanity.
005:011 When goods increase, those who eat them are increased;
        and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast
        on them with his eyes?
005:012 The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much;
        but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
005:013 There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun:
        wealth kept by its owner to his harm.
005:014 Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son,
        there is nothing in his hand.
005:015 As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go
        again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor,
        which he may carry away in his hand.
005:016 This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came,
        so shall he go.  And what profit does he have who labors
        for the wind?
005:017 All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated,
        and has sickness and wrath.
005:018 Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for
        one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor,
        in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life
        which God has given him; for this is his portion.
005:019 Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth,
        and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion,
        and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God.
005:020 For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life;
        because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.
006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it
        is heavy on men:
006:002 a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor,
        so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires,
        yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but an alien eats it.
        This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
006:003 If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years,
        so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not
        filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say,
        that an untimely birth is better than he:
006:004 for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name
        is covered with darkness.
006:005 Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it.  This has rest
        rather than the other.
006:006 Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails
        to enjoy good, don't all go to one place?
006:007 All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
        is not filled.
006:008 For what advantage has the wise more than the fool?
        What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?
006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire.
        This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
006:010 Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is
        known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is
        mightier than he.
006:011 For there are many words that create vanity.  What does
        that profit man?
006:012 For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days
        of his vain life which he spends like a shadow?
        For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
007:001 A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death
        better than the day of one's birth.
007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go
        to the house of feasting:  for that is the end of all men,
        and the living should take this to heart.
007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face
        the heart is made good.
007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
        of fools is in the house of mirth.
007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man
        to hear the song of fools.
007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
        of the fool.  This also is vanity.
007:007 Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe
        destroys the understanding.
007:008 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.
        The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
007:009 Don't be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests
        in the bosom of fools.
007:010 Don't say, "Why were the former days better than these?"
        For you do not ask wisely about this.
007:011 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance.  Yes, it is more excellent
        for those who see the sun.
007:012 For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense;
        but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves
        the life of him who has it.
007:013 Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight,
        which he has made crooked?
007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of
        adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side
        with the other, to the end that man should not find out
        anything after him.
007:015 All this have I seen in my days of vanity:  there is a righteous
        man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked
        man who lives long in his evil-doing.
007:016 Don't be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise.
        Why should you destroy yourself?
007:017 Don't be too wicked, neither be foolish.  Why should you die
        before your time?
007:018 It is good that you should take hold of this.  Yes, also from
        that don't withdraw your hand; for he who fears God will come
        forth from them all.
007:019 Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers
        who are in a city.
007:020 Surely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good
        and doesn't sin.
007:021 Also don't take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you
        hear your servant curse you;
007:022 for often your own heart knows that you yourself have
        likewise cursed others.
007:023 All this have I proved in wisdom.  I said, "I will be wise;"
        but it was far from me.
007:024 That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep.
        Who can find it out?
007:025 I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out,
        and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know
        that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness.
007:026 I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares
        and traps, whose hands are chains.  Whoever pleases God shall
        escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her.
007:027 Behold, this have I found, says the Preacher, one to another,
        to find out the scheme;
007:028 which my soul still seeks; but I have not found:
        one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among
        all those have I not found.
007:029 Behold, this only have I found:  that God made man upright;
        but they search for many schemes.
008:001 Who is like the wise man?  And who knows the interpretation of
        a thing?  A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness
        of his face is changed.
008:002 I say, "Keep the king's command!" because of the oath to God.
008:003 Don't be hasty to go out of his presence.  Don't persist
        in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him,
008:004 for the king's word is supreme.  Who can say to him,
        "What are you doing?"
008:005 Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm,
        and his wise heart will know the time and procedure.
008:006 For there is a time and procedure for every purpose,
        although the misery of man is heavy on him.
008:007 For he doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell him
        how it will be?
008:008 There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain
        the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death.
        There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver
        those who practice it.
008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is
        done under the sun.  There is a time in which one man has
        power over another to his hurt.
008:010 So I saw the wicked buried.  Indeed they came also from holiness.
        They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this.
        This also is vanity.
008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
        therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them
        to do evil.
008:012 Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long,
        yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God,
        who are reverent before him.
008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall
        he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn't fear God.
008:014 There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there
        are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work
        of the wicked.  Again, there are wicked men to whom
        it happens according to the work of the righteous.
        I said that this also is vanity.
008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing
        under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful:
        for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his
        life which God has given him under the sun.
008:016 When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
        that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither
        day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),
008:017 then I saw all the work of God, that man can't find out
        the work that is done under the sun, because however
        much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it.
        Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it,
        he won't be able to find it.
009:001 For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this:
        that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand
        of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn't know it;
        all is before them.
009:002 All things come alike to all.  There is one event to the righteous
        and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean,
        to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice.
        As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath,
        as he who fears an oath.
009:003 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there
        is one event to all:  yes also, the heart of the sons of men
        is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live,
        and after that they go to the dead.
009:004 For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope;
        for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
009:005 For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't
        know anything, neither do they have any more a reward;
        for the memory of them is forgotten.
009:006 Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago;
        neither have they any more a portion forever in anything
        that is done under the sun.
009:007 Go your way--eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine
        with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.
009:008 Let your garments be always white, and don't let your
        head lack oil.
009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of
        your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun,
        all your days of vanity:  for that is your portion in life,
        and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.
009:010 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might;
        for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
        in Sheol, where you are going.
009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
        nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,
        nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men
        of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.
009:012 For man also doesn't know his time.  As the fish that are taken
        in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare,
        even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
        falls suddenly on them.
009:013 I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it
        seemed great to me.
009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king
        came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
009:015 Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom
        delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength.  Nevertheless the poor
        man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
009:017 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry
        of him who rules among fools.
009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner
        destroys much good.
010:001 Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor;
        so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart
        at his left.
010:003 Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding
        fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.
010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don't leave
        your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.
010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort
        of error which proceeds from the ruler.
010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
010:007 I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants
        on the earth.
010:008 He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through
        a wall may be bitten by a snake.
010:009 Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them.
        Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.
010:010 If the axe is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge,
        then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.
010:011 If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit
        for the charmer's tongue.
010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool
        is swallowed by his own lips.
010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness;
        and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
010:014 A fool also multiplies words.  Man doesn't know what will be;
        and that which will be after him, who can tell him?
010:015 The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't
        know how to go to the city.
010:016 Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes
        eat in the morning!
010:017 Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,
        and your princes eat in due season, for strength,
        and not for drunkenness!
010:018 By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness
        of the hands the house leaks.
010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad;
        and money is the answer for all things.
010:020 Don't curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don't curse
        the rich in your bedchamber:  for a bird of the sky may carry
        your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.
011:001 Cast your bread on the waters; for you shall find it
        after many days.
011:002 Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight; for you don't
        know what evil will be on the earth.
011:003 If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;
        and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north,
        in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.
011:004 He who observes the wind won't sow; and he who regards
        the clouds won't reap.
011:005 As you don't know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones
        grow in the womb of her who is with child; even so you don't
        know the work of God who does all.
011:006 In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don't withhold
        your hand; for you don't know which will prosper, whether this
        or that, or whether they both will be equally good.
011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
        to see the sun.
011:008 Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;
        but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.
        All that comes is vanity.
011:009 Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you
        in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart,
        and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these
        things God will bring you into judgment.
011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil
        from your flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
012:001 Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,
        before the evil days come, and the years draw near, when you
        will say, "I have no pleasure in them;"
012:002 Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
        and the clouds return after the rain;
012:003 in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
        and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders
        cease because they are few, and those who look out of the
        windows are darkened,
012:004 and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound
        of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice
        of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
        or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken
        at the cistern,
012:007 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
        returns to God who gave it.
012:008 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
012:009 Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge.  Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set
        in order many proverbs.
012:010 The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that
        which was written blamelessly, words of truth.
012:011 The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails
        well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies,
        which are given from one shepherd.
012:012 Furthermore, my son, be admonished:  of making many books there
        is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
012:013 This is the end of the matter.  All has been heard.
        Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole
        duty of man.
012:014 For God will bring every work into judgment, with every
        hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.
Book 22 Song of Solomon
001:001 The Song of songs, which is Solomon's. Beloved
001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your love
        is better than wine.
001:003 Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.  Your name is oil poured forth,
        therefore the virgins love you.
001:004 Take me away with you.  Let us hurry.  The king has brought me
        into his chambers.  Friends We will be glad and rejoice in you.
        We will praise your love more than wine!  Beloved They are
        right to love you.
001:005 I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem,
        like Kedar's tents, like Solomon's curtains.
001:006 Don't stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me.
        My mother's sons were angry with me.  They made me keeper
        of the vineyards.  I haven't kept my own vineyard.
001:007 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock,
        where you rest them at noon; For why should I be as one who is
        veiled beside the flocks of your companions?  Lover
001:008 If you don't know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks
        of the sheep.  Graze your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
001:009 I have compared you, my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
001:010 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with
        strings of jewels.
001:011 We will make you earrings of gold, with studs of silver.
        Beloved
001:012 While the king sat at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
001:013 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts.
001:014 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards
        of En Gedi.  Lover
001:015 Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
        Your eyes are doves.  Beloved
001:016 Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; and our
        couch is verdant.  Lover
001:017 The beams of our house are cedars.  Our rafters are firs.
        Beloved
002:001 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.  Lover
002:002 As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
        Beloved
002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
        among the sons.  I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
        his fruit was sweet to my taste.
002:004 He brought me to the banquet hall.  His banner over me is love.
002:005 Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am
        faint with love.
002:006 His left hand is under my head.  His right hand embraces me.
002:007 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
        the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
        until it so desires.
002:008 The voice of my beloved!  Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains,
        skipping on the hills.
002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.  Behold, he stands
        behind our wall!  He looks in at the windows.  He glances
        through the lattice.
002:010 My beloved spoke, and said to me, "Rise up, my love,
        my beautiful one, and come away.
002:011 For, behold, the winter is past.  The rain is over and gone.
002:012 The flowers appear on the earth.  The time of the singing has come,
        and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
002:013 The fig tree ripens her green figs.  The vines are in blossom.
        They give forth their fragrance.  Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
        and come away."  Lover
002:014 My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of
        the mountainside, Let me see your face.  Let me hear your voice;
        for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
002:015 Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards;
        for our vineyards are in blossom.  Beloved
002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his.  He browses among the lilies.
002:017 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
        and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.
003:001 By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loves.
        I sought him, but I didn't find him.
003:002 I will get up now, and go about the city; in the streets
        and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.
        I sought him, but I didn't find him.
003:003 The watchmen who go about the city found me; "Have you seen
        him whom my soul loves?"
003:004 I had scarcely passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves.
        I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him
        into my mother's house, into the chamber of her who conceived me.
003:005 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
        the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
        until it so desires.
003:006 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars
        of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all spices
        of the merchant?
003:007 Behold, it is Solomon's carriage!  Sixty mighty men are around it,
        of the mighty men of Israel.
003:008 They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.
        Every man has his sword on his thigh, because of fear
        in the night.
003:009 King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon.
003:010 He made its pillars of silver, its bottom of gold,
        its seat of purple, its midst being paved with love,
        from the daughters of Jerusalem.
003:011 Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,
        with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,
        in the day of his weddings, in the day of the gladness
        of his heart.  Lover
004:001 Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
        Your eyes are doves behind your veil.  Your hair is as a flock
        of goats, that descend from Mount Gilead.
004:002 Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, which have come
        up from the washing, where every one of them has twins.
        None is bereaved among them.
004:003 Your lips are like scarlet thread.  Your mouth is lovely.
        Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
004:004 Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory, whereon a
        thousand shields hang, all the shields of the mighty men.
004:005 Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe,
        which feed among the lilies.
004:006 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will go
        to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.
004:007 You are all beautiful, my love.  There is no spot in you.
004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon.
        Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon,
        from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
004:009 You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
        You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one
        chain of your neck.
004:010 How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
        How much better is your love than wine!  The fragrance of your
        perfumes than all manner of spices!
004:011 Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.  Honey and milk
        are under your tongue.  The smell of your garments is like
        the smell of Lebanon.
004:012 A locked up garden is my sister, my bride; a locked up spring,
        a sealed fountain.
004:013 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits:
        henna with spikenard plants,
004:014 spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind
        of incense tree; myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,
004:015 a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, flowing streams
        from Lebanon.  Beloved
004:016 Awake, north wind; and come, you south!  Blow on my garden,
        that its spices may flow out.  Let my beloved come into his garden,
        and taste his precious fruits.  Lover
005:001 I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
        I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my
        honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.
        Friends Eat, friends!  Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.
        Beloved
005:002 I was asleep, but my heart was awake.  It is the voice
        of my beloved who knocks:  "Open to me, my sister, my love,
        my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew,
        and my hair with the dampness of the night."
005:003 I have taken off my robe.  Indeed, must I put it on?
        I have washed my feet.  Indeed, must I soil them?
005:004 My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.
        My heart pounded for him.
005:005 I rose up to open for my beloved.  My hands dripped with myrrh,
        my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock.
005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left; and had gone away.
        My heart went out when he spoke.  I looked for him, but I
        didn't find him.  I called him, but he didn't answer.
005:007 The watchmen who go about the city found me.  They beat me.
        They bruised me.  The keepers of the walls took my cloak
        away from me.
005:008 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved,
        that you tell him that I am faint with love.  Friends
005:009 How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest
        among women?  How is your beloved better than another beloved,
        that you do so adjure us?  Beloved
005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy.  The best among ten thousand.
005:011 His head is like the purest gold.  His hair is bushy,
        black as a raven.
005:012 His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk,
        mounted like jewels.
005:013 His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.
        His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
005:014 His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.
        His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.
005:015 His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.
        His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
005:016 His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely.
        This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
        Friends
006:001 Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women?
        Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
        Beloved
006:002 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,
        to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.  He browses
        among the lilies,
006:004 You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem,
        awesome as an army with banners.
006:005 Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me.
        Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along
        the side of Gilead.
006:006 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up
        from the washing; of which every one has twins; none is
        bereaved among them.
006:007 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
006:008 There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins
        without number.
006:009 My dove, my perfect one, is unique.  She is her mother's
        only daughter.  She is the favorite one of her who bore her.
        The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens
        and the concubines, and they praised her.
006:010 Who is she who looks forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon,
        clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?
006:011 I went down into the nut tree grove, to see the green
        plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded,
        and the pomegranates were in flower.
006:012 Without realizing it, my desire set me with my royal
        people's chariots.  Friends
006:013 Return, return, Shulammite!  Return, return, that we may gaze
        at you.  Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,
        as at the dance of Mahanaim?
007:001 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince's daughter!
        Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands
        of a skillful workman.
007:002 Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed wine is wanting.
        Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies.
007:003 Your two breasts are like two fawns, that are twins of a roe.
007:004 Your neck is like an ivory tower.  Your eyes are like the pools
        in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim.  Your nose is like
        the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
007:005 Your head on you is like Carmel.  The hair of your head like purple.
        The king is held captive in its tresses.
007:006 How beautiful and how pleasant you are, love, for delights!
007:007 This, your stature, is like a palm tree, your breasts
        like its fruit.
007:008 I said, "I will climb up into the palm tree.  I will take hold
        of its fruit."  Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
        the smell of your breath like apples, Beloved
007:009 Your mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for
        my beloved, gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
007:010 I am my beloved's. His desire is toward me.
007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field.
        Let us lodge in the villages.
007:012 Let's go early up to the vineyards.  Let's see whether the vine
        has budded, its blossom is open, and the pomegranates are in flower.
        There I will give you my love.
007:013 The mandrakes give forth fragrance.  At our doors are all
        kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have stored
        up for you, my beloved.
008:001 Oh that you were like my brother, who sucked the breasts
        of my mother!  If I found you outside, I would kiss you;
        yes, and no one would despise me.
008:002 I would lead you, bringing you into my mother's house,
        who would instruct me.  I would have you drink spiced wine,
        of the juice of my pomegranate.
008:003 His left hand would be under my head.  His right hand
        would embrace me.
008:004 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up,
        nor awaken love, until it so desires.  Friends
008:005 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning on
        her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you.
        There your mother conceived you.  There she was in labor
        and bore you.
008:006 Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm;
        for love is strong as death.  Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
        Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of Yahweh.
008:007 Many waters can't quench love, neither can floods drown it.
        If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
        he would be utterly scorned.  Friends
008:008 We have a little sister.  She has no breasts.  What shall we
        do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for?
008:009 If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver.
        if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
        Beloved
008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes
        like one who found peace.
008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.  He leased out the vineyard
        to keepers.  Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver
        for its fruit.
008:012 My own vineyard is before me.  The thousand are for you, Solomon;
        two hundred for those who tend its fruit.  Lover
008:013 You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,
        let me hear your voice!  Beloved
008:014 Come away, my beloved!  Be like a gazelle or a young stag
        on the mountains of spices!
Book 23 Isaiah
001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
        and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
        kings of Judah.
001:002 Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
        I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
        rebelled against me.
001:003 The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib;
        but Israel doesn't know, my people don't consider.
001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, a seed
        of evil-doers, children who deal corruptly!  They have
        forsaken Yahweh.  They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
        They are estranged and backward.
001:005 Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more?
        The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
001:006 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness
        in it:  wounds, welts, and open sores.  They haven't been closed,
        neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
001:007 Your country is desolate.  Your cities are burned with fire.
        Strangers devour your land in your presence, and it is desolate,
        as overthrown by strangers.
001:008 The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
        like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.
001:009 Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
        we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah.
001:010 Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!  Listen to the law
        of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
001:011 "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says Yahweh.
        "I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat
        of fed animals.  I don't delight in the blood of bulls,
        or of lambs, or of male goats.
001:012 When you come to appear before me, who has required this
        at your hand, to trample my courts?
001:013 Bring no more vain offerings.  Incense is an abomination to me;
        new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:  I can't bear
        with evil assemblies.
001:014 My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.
        They are a burden to me.  I am weary of bearing them.
001:015 When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
        Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
        Your hands are full of blood.
001:016 Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.  Put away the evil
        of your doings from before my eyes.  Cease to do evil.
001:017 Learn to do well.  Seek justice.  Relieve the oppressed.
        Judge the fatherless.  Plead for the widow."
001:018 "Come now, and let us reason together," says Yahweh:  "Though your
        sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
        Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
001:019 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good
        of the land;
001:020 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;
        for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
001:021 How the faithful city has become a prostitute!  She was full
        of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
001:022 Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.
001:023 Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves.
        Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.
        They don't judge the fatherless, neither does the cause
        of the widow come to them.
001:024 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, the Mighty One
        of Israel, says:  "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
        and avenge myself of my enemies;
001:025 and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross,
        and will take away all your tin.
001:026 I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors
        as at the beginning.  Afterward you shall be called 'The city
        of righteousness, a faithful town.'
001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts
        with righteousness.
001:028 But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
        and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
        and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
001:030 For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden
        that has no water.
001:031 The strong will be like tinder, and his work like a spark.
        They will both burn together, and no one will quench them."
002:001 This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning
        Judah and Jerusalem.
002:002 It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's
        house shall be established on the top of the mountains,
        and shall be raised above the hills; and all nations shall
        flow to it.
002:003 Many peoples shall go and say, "Come, let's go up to
        the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths."
        For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of
        Yahweh from Jerusalem.
002:004 He will judge between the nations, and will decide
        concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords
        into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.
        Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
        they learn war any more.
002:005 House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
002:006 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,
        because they are filled from the east, with those who practice
        divination like the Philistines, and they clasp hands with
        the children of foreigners.
002:007 Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any
        end of their treasures.  Their land also is full of horses,
        neither is there any end of their chariots.
002:008 Their land also is full of idols.  They worship the work
        of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
002:009 Man is brought low, and mankind is humbled; therefore don't
        forgive them.
002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from before the terror
        of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty.
002:011 The lofty looks of man will be brought low, the haughtiness
        of men will be bowed down, and Yahweh alone will be exalted
        in that day.
002:012 For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that
        is proud and haughty, and for all that is lifted up;
        and it shall be brought low:
002:013 For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
        for all the oaks of Bashan,
002:014 For all the high mountains, for all the hills that are lifted up,
002:015 For every lofty tower, for every fortified wall,
002:016 For all the ships of Tarshish, and for all pleasant imagery.
002:017 The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
        of men shall be brought low; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted
        in that day.
002:018 The idols shall utterly pass away.
002:019 Men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes
        of the earth, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory
        of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
002:020 In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,
        and their idols of gold, which have been made for themselves
        to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
002:021 To go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts
        of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Yahweh,
        and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake
        the earth mightily.
002:022 Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
        for of what account is he?
003:001 For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem
        and from Judah supply and support, the whole supply of bread,
        and the whole supply of water;
003:002 the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet,
        the diviner, the elder,
003:003 the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor,
        the skilled craftsman, and the clever enchanter.
003:004 I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall
        rule over them.
003:005 The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone
        by his neighbor.  The child will behave himself proudly
        against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
003:006 Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house
        of his father, saying, "You have clothing, you be our ruler,
        and let this ruin be under your hand."
003:007 In that day he will cry out, saying, I will not be a healer;
        for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
        You shall not make me ruler of the people.
003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their
        tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes
        of his glory.
003:009 The look of their faces testify against them.  They parade
        their sin like Sodom.  They don't hide it.  Woe to their soul!
        For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
003:010 Tell the righteous "Good!"  For they shall eat the fruit
        of their deeds.
003:011 Woe to the wicked!  Disaster is upon them; for the deeds
        of his hands will be paid back to him.
003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
        over them.  My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
        and destroy the way of your paths.
003:013 Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.
003:014 Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people,
        and their leaders:  "It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
        The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
003:015 What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face
        of the poor?" says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
003:016 Moreover Yahweh said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
        and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
        walking to trip as they go, jingling ornaments on their feet;
003:017 therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head
        of the women of Zion, and Yahweh will make their scalps bald."
003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets,
        the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
003:019 the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
003:020 the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume
        bottles, the charms,
003:021 the signet rings, the nose rings,
003:022 the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
003:023 the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras,
        and the shawls.
003:024 It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall
        be rottenness; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well
        set hair, baldness; instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth;
        and branding instead of beauty.
003:025 Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.
003:026 Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate
        and sit on the ground.
004:001 Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,
        "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing:
        only let us be called by your name.  Take away our reproach."
004:002 In that day, Yahweh's branch will be beautiful and glorious,
        and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory
        of the survivors of Israel.
004:003 It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains
        in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is
        written among the living in Jerusalem;
004:004 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
        of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst,
        by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
004:005 Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion,
        and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
        and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all
        the glory will be a canopy.
004:006 There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat,
        and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
005:001 Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about
        his vineyard.  My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
005:002 He dug it up, gathered out its stones, planted it with
        the choicest vine, built a tower in its midst, and also cut
        out a winepress therein.  He looked for it to yield grapes,
        but it yielded wild grapes.
005:003 "Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge
        between me and my vineyard.
005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have
        not done in it?  Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes,
        did it yield wild grapes?
005:005 Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
        I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
        I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.
005:006 I will lay it a wasteland.  It won't be pruned nor hoed,
        but it will grow briers and thorns.  I will also command
        the clouds that they rain no rain on it."
005:007 For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
        and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:  and he looked
        for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness,
        but, behold, a cry of distress.
005:008 Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field,
        until there is no room, and you are made to dwell alone
        in the midst of the land!
005:009 In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says:  "Surely many houses will
        be desolate, even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
005:010 For ten acres{literally, ten yokes, or the amount of land
        that ten yokes of oxen can plow in one day, which is about 10
        acres or 4 hectares.} of vineyard shall yield one bath,{1
        bath is about 22 litres, 5.8 U. S. gallons, or 4.8 imperial
        gallons} and a homer{1 homer is about 220 litres or 6 bushels}
        of seed shall yield an ephah.{1 ephah is about 22 litres or 0.6
        bushels or about 2 pecks)--only one tenth of what was sown.}"
005:011 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they
        may follow strong drink; who stay late into the night,
        until wine inflames them!
005:012 The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at
        their feasts; but they don't regard the work of Yahweh,
        neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
005:013 Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
        Their honorable men are famished, and their multitudes are
        parched with thirst.
005:014 Therefore Sheol{Sheol is the place of the dead.} has enlarged
        its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory,
        their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them,
        descend into it.
005:015 So man is brought low, mankind is humbled, and the eyes
        of the arrogant ones are humbled;
005:016 but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One
        is sanctified in righteousness.
005:017 Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and strangers
        will eat the ruins of the rich.
005:018 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
        and wickedness as with cart rope;
005:019 Who say, "Let him make speed, let him hasten his work,
        that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One
        of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!"
005:020 Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness
        for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet,
        and sweet for bitter!
005:021 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent
        in their own sight!
005:022 Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and champions
        at mixing strong drink;
005:023 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice
        for the innocent!
005:024 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
        and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root
        shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust;
        because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,
        and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
005:025 Therefore Yahweh's anger burns against his people, and he has
        stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.
        The mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse
        in the midst of the streets.  For all this, his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is still stretched out.
005:026 He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,
        and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.
        Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
        nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,
        nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
005:028 whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent.  Their horses'
        hoofs will be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.
005:029 Their roaring will be like a lioness.  They will roar like
        young lions.  Yes, they shall roar, and seize their prey
        and carry it off, and there will be no one to deliver.
005:030 They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
        If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress.
        The light is darkened in its clouds.
006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on
        a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
006:002 Above him stood the seraphim.  Each one had six wings.
        With two he covered his face.  With two he covered his feet.
        With two he flew.
006:003 One called to another, and said, "Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh
        of Armies!  The whole earth is full of his glory!"
006:004 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him
        who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
006:005 Then I said, "Woe is me!  For I am undone, because I am a man of
        unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:
        for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!"
006:006 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand,
        which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
006:007 He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has
        touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away,
        and your sin forgiven."
006:008 I heard the Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send,
        and who will go for us?"  Then I said, "Here I am.  Send me!"
006:009 He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'You hear indeed,
        but don't understand; and you see indeed, but don't perceive.'
006:010 Make the heart of this people fat.  Make their ears heavy,
        and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes,
        and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
        and turn again, and be healed."
006:011 Then I said, "Lord, how long?"  He answered, "Until cities
        are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man,
        and the land becomes utterly waste,
006:012 And Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places
        are many in the midst of the land.
006:013 If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed:
        as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they
        are felled; so the holy seed is its stock."
007:001 It happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
        of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
        and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to
        Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
007:002 It was told the house of David, saying, "Syria is allied
        with Ephraim."  His heart trembled, and the heart of his people,
        as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
007:003 Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz,
        you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit
        of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field.
007:004 Tell him, 'Be careful, and keep calm.  Don't be afraid,
        neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails
        of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria,
        and of the son of Remaliah.
007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted
        evil against you, saying,
007:006 "Let's go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let's divide
        it among ourselves, and set up a king in the midst of it,
        even the son of Tabeel."
007:007 This is what the Lord Yahweh says:  "It shall not stand,
        neither shall it happen."
007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
        and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces,
        so that it shall not be a people;
007:009 and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria
        is Remaliah's son.  If you will not believe, surely you shall
        not be established.'"
007:010 Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
007:011 "Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth,
        or in the height above."
007:012 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh."
007:013 He said, "Listen now, house of David:  Is it not enough for you
        to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience
        of my God also?
007:014 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
        Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall
        call his name Immanuel.{"Immanuel" means "God with us."}
007:015 He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil,
        and choose the good.
007:016 For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
        the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.
007:017 Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house,
        days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed
        from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
007:018 It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly
        that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt,
        and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
007:019 They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys,
        in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges,
        and on all pastures.
007:020 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired
        in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria,
        the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also
        consume the beard.
007:021 It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow,
        and two sheep;
007:022 and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk
        which they shall give he shall eat butter:  for everyone will
        eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land.
007:023 It will happen in that day that every place where there
        were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be
        for briers and thorns.
007:024 People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all
        the land will be briers and thorns.
007:025 All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall
        not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be
        for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep."
008:001 Yahweh said to me, "Take a large tablet, and write on it with a
        man's pen, 'For Maher Shalal Hash Baz;{"Maher Shalal Hash Baz"
        means "quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil."}'
008:002 and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify:
        Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."
008:003 I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son.
        Then said Yahweh to me, "Call his name 'Maher Shalal Hash Baz.'
008:004 For before the child knows how to say, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,'
        the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried
        away by the king of Assyria."
008:005 Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,
008:006 "Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah
        that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
008:007 now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood
        waters of the River:  the king of Assyria and all his glory.
        It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
008:008 It will sweep onward into Judah.  It will overflow and pass through;
        it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its
        wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.
008:009 Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces!  Listen, all you
        from far countries:  dress for battle, and be shattered!
        Dress for battle, and be shattered!
008:010 Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing;
        speak the word, and it will not stand:  for God is with us."
008:011 For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
        me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
008:012 "Don't say, 'A conspiracy!' concerning all about which this
        people say, 'A conspiracy!' neither fear their threats,
        nor be terrorized.
008:013 Yahweh of Armies is who you must regard as holy.
        He is the one you must fear.  He is the one you must dread.
008:014 He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel,
        he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
008:015 Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared,
        and be captured."
008:016 Wrap up the testimony.  Seal the law among my disciples.
008:017 I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob,
        and I will look for him.
008:018 Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are
        for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies,
        who dwells in Mount Zion.
008:019 When they tell you, "Consult with those who have familiar
        spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:"
        shouldn't a people consult with their God?  Should they
        consult the dead on behalf of the living?
008:020 Turn to the law and to the testimony!  If they don't speak
        according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
008:021 They will pass through it, sore distressed and hungry;
        and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry,
        and curse by their king and by their God.  They will turn
        their faces upward,
008:022 and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom
        of anguish.  They will be driven into thick darkness.
009:001 But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish.
        In the former time, he brought into contempt the land
        of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter
        time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea,
        beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
009:002 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
        Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them
        the light has shined.
009:003 You have multiplied the nation.  You have increased their joy.
        They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest,
        as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
009:004 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder,
        the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.
009:005 For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle,
        and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning,
        fuel for the fire.
009:006 For to us a child is born.  To us a son is given;
        and the government will be on his shoulders.  His name will be
        called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
        Prince of Peace.
009:007 Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall
        be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom,
        to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and
        with righteousness from that time on, even forever.
        The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.
009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it falls on Israel.
009:009 All the people will know, including Ephraim and the inhabitants
        of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
009:010 "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with hewn stone.
        The sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will put
        cedars in their place."
009:011 Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries
        of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
009:012 The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they
        will devour Israel with open mouth.  For all this, his anger
        is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
009:013 Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,
        neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies.
009:014 Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,
        palm branch and reed, in one day.
009:015 The elder and the honorable man is the head, and the prophet
        who teaches lies is the tail.
009:016 For those who lead this people lead them astray; and those
        who are led by them are destroyed.
009:017 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
        neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
        for everyone is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth
        speaks folly.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
009:018 For wickedness burns like a fire.  It devours the briers
        and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,
        and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
009:019 Through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies, the land is
        burnt up; and the people are the fuel for the fire.
        No one spares his brother.
009:020 One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will
        eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.
        Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall
        be against Judah.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
010:001 Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers
        who write oppressive decrees;
010:002 to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the poor among
        my people of their rights, that widows may be their spoil,
        and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
010:003 What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
        which will come from afar?  To whom will you flee for help?
        Where will you leave your wealth?
010:004 They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall
        under the slain.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
010:005 Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand
        is my indignation!
010:006 I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people
        who anger me will I give him a charge to take the spoil
        and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire
        of the streets.
010:007 However he doesn't mean so, neither does his heart think so;
        but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not
        a few nations.
010:008 For he says, "Aren't all of my princes kings?
010:009 Isn't Calno like Carchemish?  Isn't Hamath like Arpad?
        Isn't Samaria like Damascus?"
010:010 As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved
        images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
010:011 shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols,
        so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
010:012 Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed
        his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish
        the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria,
        and the insolence of his haughty looks.
010:013 For he has said, "By the strength of my hand I have done it,
        and by my wisdom; for I have understanding:  and I have removed
        the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures.
        Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.
010:014 My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest,
        and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered
        all the earth.  There was no one who moved their wing,
        or that opened their mouth, or chirped."
010:015 Should an axe brag against him who chops with it?
        Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it?
        As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff
        should lift up someone who is not wood.
010:016 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat
        ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled
        like the burning of fire.
010:017 The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One
        for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his
        briers in one day.
010:018 He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field,
        both soul and body.  It will be as when a standard bearer faints.
010:019 The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,
        so that a child could write their number.
010:020 It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel,
        and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more
        again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh,
        the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
010:021 A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob,
        to the mighty God.
010:022 For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea,
        only a remnant of them will return.  A destruction is determined,
        overflowing with righteousness.
010:023 For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end,
        and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
010:024 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says "My people who dwell
        in Zion, don't be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike
        you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you,
        as Egypt did.
010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation against
        you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed
        to his destruction."
010:026 Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him,
        as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb.
        His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like
        he did against Egypt.
010:027 It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart
        from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck,
        and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
010:028 He has come to Aiath.  He has passed through Migron.
        At Michmash he stores his baggage.
010:029 They have gone over the pass.  They have taken up their lodging
        at Geba.  Ramah trembles.  Gibeah of Saul has fled.
010:030 Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim!  Listen, Laishah!
        You poor Anathoth!
010:031 Madmenah is a fugitive.  The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
010:032 This very day he will halt at Nob.  He shakes his hand at
        the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
010:033 Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror.
        The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
010:034 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
        and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
011:001 A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch
        out of his roots will bear fruit.
011:002 The Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him:  the spirit of wisdom
        and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
        of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.
011:003 His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh.  He will not judge
        by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing
        of his ears;
011:004 but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide
        with equity for the humble of the earth.  He will strike
        the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath
        of his lips he will kill the wicked.
011:005 Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness
        the belt of his waist.
011:006 The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down
        with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened
        calf together; and a little child will lead them.
011:007 The cow and the bear will graze.  Their young ones will lie
        down together.  The lion will eat straw like the ox.
011:008 The nursing child will play near a cobra's hole, and the weaned
        child will put his hand on the viper's den.
011:009 They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;
        for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh,
        as the waters cover the sea.
011:010 It will happen in that day that the nations will seek
        the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples;
        and his resting place will be glorious.
011:011 It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand
        again the second time to recover the remnant that is left
        of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush,
        from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands
        of the sea.
011:012 He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble
        the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed
        of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
011:013 The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute
        Judah will be cut off.  Ephraim won't envy Judah, and Judah
        won't persecute Ephraim.
011:014 They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west.
        Together they will plunder the children of the east.
        They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children
        of Ammon will obey them.
011:015 Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
        and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River,
        and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march
        over in sandals.
011:016 There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his
        people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day
        that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
012:001 In that day you will say, "I will give thanks to you, Yahweh;
        for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away
        and you comfort me.
012:002 Behold, God is my salvation.  I will trust, and will not
        be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song;
        and he has become my salvation."
012:003 Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.
012:004 In that day you will say, "Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name.
        Declare his doings among the peoples.  Proclaim that his
        name is exalted!
012:005 Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things!
        Let this be known in all the earth!
012:006 Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One
        of Israel is great in the midst of you!"
013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:
013:002 Set up a banner on the bare mountain!  Lift up your voice to them!
        Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
013:003 I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called
        my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.
013:004 The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people;
        the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations
        gathered together!  Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army
        for the battle.
013:005 They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven,
        even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy
        the whole land.
013:006 Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at hand!  It will come as
        destruction from the Almighty.
013:007 Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone's heart will melt.
013:008 They will be dismayed.  Pangs and sorrows will seize them.
        They will be in pain like a woman in labor.  They will look
        in amazement one at another.  Their faces will be faces of flame.
013:009 Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger;
        to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners
        out of it.
013:010 For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give
        their light.  The sun will be darkened in its going forth,
        and the moon will not cause its light to shine.
013:011 I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked
        for their iniquity.  I will cause the arrogance of the proud
        to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.
013:012 I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person
        than the pure gold of Ophir.
013:013 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will
        be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies,
        and in the day of his fierce anger.
013:014 It will happen that like a a hunted gazelle, and like sheep
        that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people,
        and will each flee to their own land.
013:015 Everyone who is found will be thrust through.  Everyone who is
        captured will fall by the sword.
013:016 Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes.
        Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped.
013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not
        value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it.
013:018 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces;
        and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb.
        Their eyes will not spare children.
013:019 Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans'
        pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
013:020 It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from
        generation to generation.  The Arabian will not pitch a tent there,
        neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
013:021 But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their
        houses will be full of jackals.  Ostriches will dwell there,
        and wild goats will frolic there.
013:022 Wolves will cry in their castles, and jackals in the
        pleasant palaces.  Her time is near to come, and her days
        will not be prolonged.
014:001 For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will
        yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land.
        The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite
        with the house of Jacob.
014:002 The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place.
        The house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh's land for servants
        and for handmaids.  They will take as captives those whose
        captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
014:003 It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from
        your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service
        in which you were made to serve,
014:004 that you will take up this parable against the king
        of Babylon, and say, "How the oppressor has ceased!
        The golden city has ceased!"
014:005 Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter
        of the rulers,
014:006 who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled
        the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.
014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet.  They break out song.
014:008 Yes, the fir trees rejoice with you, with the cedars
        of Lebanon, saying, "Since you are humbled, no lumberjack
        has come up against us."
014:009 Sheol from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming.
        It stirs up the dead for you, even all the rulers of the earth.
        It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
014:010 They all will answer and ask you, "Have you also become as weak
        as we are?  Have you become like us?"
014:011 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, with the sound of your
        stringed instruments.  Maggots are spread out under you,
        and worms cover you.
014:012 How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn!
        How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!
014:013 You said in your heart, "I will ascend into heaven!
        I will exalt my throne above the stars of God!  I will sit
        on the mountain of assembly, in the far north!
014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds!  I will make
        myself like the Most High!"
014:015 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit.
014:016 Those who see you will stare at you.  They will ponder you,
        saying, "Is this the man who made the earth to tremble,
        who shook kingdoms;
014:017 who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities;
        who didn't release his prisoners to their home?"
014:018 All the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in
        his own house.
014:019 But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch,
        clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword,
        who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body
        trodden under foot.
014:020 You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed
        your land.  You have killed your people.  The seed of evil-doers
        will not be named forever.
014:021 Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity
        of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth,
        and fill the surface of the world with cities.
014:022 "I will rise up against them," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and
        son's son," says Yahweh.
014:023 "I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools
        of water.  I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
014:024 Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have thought,
        so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
014:025 that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him
        under foot on my mountains.  Then his yoke will leave them,
        and his burden leave their shoulders.
014:026 This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth.
        This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
014:027 For Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it?
        His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?"
014:028 This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.
014:029 Don't rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that
        struck you is broken; for out of the serpent's root an adder
        will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.
014:030 The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie
        down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine,
        and your remnant will be killed.
014:031 Howl, gate!  Cry, city!  You are melted away, Philistia, all of you;
        for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler
        in his ranks.
014:032 What will they answer the messengers of the nation?
        That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his
        people will take refuge.
015:001 The burden of Moab:  for in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste,
        and brought to nothing; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
        and brought to nothing.
015:002 They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places,
        to weep.  Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba.
        Baldness is on all of their heads.  Every beard is cut off.
015:003 In their streets, they dress themselves in sackcloth.
        In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails,
        weeping abundantly.
015:004 Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.  Their voice is heard even
        to Jahaz.  Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud.
        Their souls tremble within them.
015:005 My heart cries out for Moab!  Her nobles flee to Zoar,
        to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith
        with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim, they raise up
        a cry of destruction.
015:006 For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has
        withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.
015:007 Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten,
        and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows.
015:008 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab; its wailing
        to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.
015:009 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring
        yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape,
        and on the remnant of the land.
016:001 Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness,
        to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
016:002 For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest,
        so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.
016:003 Give counsel!  Execute justice!  Make your shade like
        the night in the midst of the noonday!  Hide the outcasts!
        Don't betray the fugitive!
016:004 Let my outcasts dwell with you!  As for Moab, be a
        hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer.
        For the extortioner is brought to nothing.  Destruction ceases.
        The oppressors are consumed out of the land.
016:005 A throne will be established in loving kindness.  One will sit
        on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice,
        and swift to do righteousness.
016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud;
        even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath.
        His boastings are nothing.
016:007 Therefore Moab will wail for Moab.  Everyone will wail.
        You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth,
        utterly stricken.
016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah.
        The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches,
        which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness.
        Its shoots were spread abroad.  They passed over the sea.
016:009 Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine
        of Sibmah.  I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh:
        for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle
        shout has fallen.
016:010 Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field;
        and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither
        joyful noise.  Nobody will tread out wine in the presses.
        I have made the shouting stop.
016:011 Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward
        parts for Kir Heres.
016:012 It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies
        himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray,
        that he will not prevail.
016:013 This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.
016:014 But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, "Within three years,
        as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab
        shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude;
        and the remnant will be very small and feeble."
017:001 The burden of Damascus:  "Behold, Damascus is taken away
        from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.
017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken.  They will be for flocks,
        which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
017:003 The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
        from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria.  They will be as
        the glory of the children of Israel," says Yahweh of Armies.
017:004 "It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be
        made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
017:005 It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his
        arm reaps the grain.  Yes, it will be like when one gleans
        grain in the valley of Rephaim.
017:006 Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree,
        two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough,
        four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,"
        says Yahweh, the God of Israel.
017:007 In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes
        will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.
017:008 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands;
        neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made,
        either the Asherim, or the incense altars.
017:009 In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places
        in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from
        before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation.
017:010 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not
        remembered the rock of your strength.  Therefore you plant
        pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings.
017:011 In the day of your planting, you hedge it in.  In the morning,
        you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away
        in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
017:012 Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas;
        and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing
        of mighty waters!
017:013 The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters:
        but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will
        be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
        and like the whirling dust before the storm.
017:014 At evening, behold, terror!  Before the morning, they are no more.
        This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot
        of those who rob us.
018:001 Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond
        the rivers of Ethiopia;
018:002 that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
        papyrus on the waters, saying, "Go, you swift messengers,
        to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their
        beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down,
        whose land the rivers divide!"
018:003 All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth,
        when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look!
        When the trumpet is blown, listen!
018:004 For Yahweh said to me, "I will be still, and I will see in my
        dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud
        of dew in the heat of harvest."
018:005 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over,
        and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off
        the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take
        away the spreading branches.
018:006 They will be left together for the ravenous birds
        of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth.
        The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the animals
        of the earth will winter on them.
018:007 In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies
        from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome
        from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out
        and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place
        of the name of Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.
019:001 The burden of Egypt:  "Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud,
        and comes to Egypt.  The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence;
        and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst.
019:002 I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they
        will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against
        his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
019:003 The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst.  I will destroy
        its counsel.  They will seek the idols, the charmers,
        those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.
019:004 I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord.
        A fierce king will rule over them," says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
019:005 The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted
        and become dry.
019:006 The rivers will become foul.  The streams of Egypt will be
        diminished and dried up.  The reeds and flags will wither away.
019:007 The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all
        the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away,
        and be no more.
019:008 The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile
        will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.
019:009 Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave
        white cloth, will be confounded.
019:010 The pillars will be broken in pieces.  All those who work
        for hire will be grieved in soul.
019:011 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish.  The counsel
        of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid.
        How do you say to Pharaoh, "I am the son of the wise,
        the son of ancient kings?"
019:012 Where then are your wise men?  Let them tell you now; and let
        them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.
019:013 The princes of Zoan have become fools.  The princes of Memphis
        are deceived.  They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are
        the cornerstone of her tribes.
019:014 Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her;
        and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works,
        like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
019:015 Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail,
        palm branch or rush, may do.
019:016 In that day the Egyptians will be like women.  They will tremble
        and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies,
        which he shakes over them.
019:017 The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt.  Everyone to whom
        mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans
        of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.
019:018 In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that
        speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies.
        One will be called "The city of destruction."
019:019 In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst
        of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.
019:020 It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies
        in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because
        of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender,
        and he will deliver them.
019:021 Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh
        in that day.  Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering,
        and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.
019:022 Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing.
        They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them,
        and will heal them.
019:023 In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
        and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian
        into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
019:024 In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
        a blessing in the midst of the earth;
019:025 because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying,
        "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands,
        and Israel my inheritance."
020:001 In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king
        of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;
020:002 at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
        saying, "Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist,
        and take your shoes from off your feet."  He did so,
        walking naked and barefoot.
020:003 Yahweh said, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and
        barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt
        and concerning Ethiopia,
020:004 so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt
        and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot,
        and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
020:005 They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia
        their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
020:006 The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, 'Behold,
        this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered
        from the king of Assyria.  And we, how will we escape?'"
021:001 The burden of the wilderness of the sea.  As whirlwinds
        in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness,
        from an awesome land.
021:002 A grievous vision is declared to me.  The treacherous
        man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys.
        Go up, Elam; attack!  I have stopped all of Media's sighing.
021:003 Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish.  Pains have
        taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor.
        I am in so much pain that I can't hear.  I so am dismayed
        that I can't see.
021:004 My heart flutters.  Horror has frightened me.  The twilight
        that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.
021:005 They prepare the table.  They set the watch.  They eat.
        They drink.  Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!
021:006 For the Lord said to me, "Go, set a watchman.  Let him declare
        what he sees.
021:007 When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop
        of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness."
021:008 He cried like a lion:  "Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower
        in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.
021:009 Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs."
        He answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved
        images of her gods are broken to the ground.
021:010 You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!"
        That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God
        of Israel, I have declared to you.
021:011 The burden of Dumah.  One calls to me out of Seir, "Watchman,
        what of the night?  Watchman, what of the night?"
021:012 The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night.
        If you will inquire, inquire.  Come back again."
021:013 The burden on Arabia.  In the forest in Arabia you will lodge,
        you caravans of Dedanites.
021:014 They brought water to him who was thirsty.  The inhabitants
        of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.
021:015 For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword,
        from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.
021:016 For the Lord said to me, "Within a year, as a worker bound
        by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,
021:017 and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty
        men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, has spoken it."
022:001 The burden of the valley of vision.  What ails you now,
        that you have all gone up to the housetops?
022:002 You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town;
        your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they
        dead in battle.
022:003 All your rulers fled away together.  They were bound by
        the archers.  All who were found by you were bound together.
        They fled far away.
022:004 Therefore I said, "Look away from me.  I will weep bitterly.
        Don't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter
        of my people.
022:005 For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity,
        from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision;
        a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains."
022:006 Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen;
        and Kir uncovered the shield.
022:007 It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
        and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
022:008 He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day
        to the armor in the house of the forest.
022:009 You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many;
        and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
022:010 You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down
        the houses to fortify the wall.
022:011 You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water
        of the old pool.  But you didn't look to him who had done this,
        neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago.
022:012 In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping,
        and to mourning, and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth:
022:013 and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and killing sheep,
        eating flesh and drinking wine:  "Let us eat and drink,
        for tomorrow we will die."
022:014 Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, "Surely this
        iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,"
        says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
022:015 Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, "Go, get yourself to
        this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,
022:016 'What are you doing here?  Who has you here, that you have
        dug out a tomb here?'  Cutting himself out a tomb on high,
        chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!"
022:017 Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently.
        Yes, he will grasp you firmly.
022:018 He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you
        like a ball into a large country.  There you will die,
        and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame
        of your lord's house.
022:019 I will thrust you from your office.  You will be pulled down
        from your station.
022:020 It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim
        the son of Hilkiah,
022:021 and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him
        with your belt.  I will commit your government into his hand;
        and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        and to the house of Judah.
022:022 I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder.
        He will open, and no one will shut.  He will shut, and no
        one will open.
022:023 I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place.
        He will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.
022:024 They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house,
        the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups
        even to all the pitchers.
022:025 "In that day," says Yahweh of Armies, "the nail that was fastened
        in a sure place will give way.  It will be cut down, and fall.
        The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Yahweh
        has spoken it."
023:001 The burden of Tyre.  Howl, you ships of Tarshish!  For it
        is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in.
        From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
023:002 Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants
        of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
023:003 On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile,
        was her revenue.  She was the market of nations.
023:004 Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold
        of the sea, saying, "I have not travailed, nor brought forth,
        neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins."
023:005 When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at
        the report of Tyre.
023:006 Pass over to Tarshish!  Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!
023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days,
        whose feet carried her far away to travel?
023:008 Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns,
        whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable
        of the earth?
023:009 Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory,
        to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
023:010 Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish.
        There is no restraint any more.
023:011 He has stretched out his hand over the sea.  He has
        shaken the kingdoms.  Yahweh has ordered the destruction
        of Canaan's strongholds.
023:012 He said, "You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed
        virgin daughter of Sidon.  Arise, pass over to Kittim.
        Even there you will have no rest."
023:013 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans.  This people was not.
        The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness.
        They set up their towers.  They overthrew its palaces.
        They made it a ruin.
023:014 Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!
023:015 It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten
        seventy years, according to the days of one king.
        After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in
        the song of the prostitute.
023:016 Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has
        been forgotten.  Make sweet melody.  Sing many songs,
        that you may be remembered.
023:017 It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh
        will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages,
        and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world
        on the surface of the earth.
023:018 Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh.
        It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise
        will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently,
        and for durable clothing.
024:001 Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste,
        turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.
024:002 It will be as with the people, so with the priest;
        as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid,
        so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller;
        as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker
        of interest, so with the giver of interest.
024:003 The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste;
        for Yahweh has spoken this word.
024:004 The earth mourns and fades away.  The world languishes and
        fades away.  The lofty people of the earth languish.
024:005 The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they
        have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken
        the everlasting covenant.
024:006 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who
        dwell therein are found guilty.  Therefore the inhabitants
        of the earth are burned, and few men left.
024:007 The new wine mourns.  The vine languishes.
        All the merry-hearted sigh.
024:008 The mirth of tambourines ceases.  The sound of those who
        rejoice ends.  The joy of the harp ceases.
024:009 They will not drink wine with a song.  Strong drink will be
        bitter to those who drink it.
024:010 The confused city is broken down.  Every house is shut up,
        that no man may come in.
024:011 There is a crying in the streets because of the wine.
        All joy is darkened.  The mirth of the land is gone.
024:012 The city is left in desolation, and the gate is
        struck with destruction.
024:013 For it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
        as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when
        the vintage is done.
024:014 These shall lift up their voice.  They will shout for the majesty
        of Yahweh.  They cry aloud from the sea.
024:015 Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!
024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs.
        Glory to the righteous!  But I said, "I pine away!
        I pine away! woe is me!"  The treacherous have dealt treacherously.
        Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.
024:017 Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.
024:018 It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear
        will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst
        of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high
        are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
024:019 The earth is utterly broken.  The earth is torn apart.
        The earth is shaken violently.
024:020 The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back
        and forth like a hammock.  Its disobedience will be heavy on it,
        and it will fall and not rise again.
024:021 It shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army
        of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth
        on the earth.
024:022 They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
        in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after
        many days shall they be visited.
024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed;
        for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;
        and before his elders will be glory.
025:001 Yahweh, you are my God.  I will exalt you!  I will praise your name,
        for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago,
        in complete faithfulness and truth.
025:002 For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city
        into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city.
        It will never be built.
025:003 Therefore a strong people will glorify you.  A city of awesome
        nations will fear you.
025:004 For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold
        to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm,
        a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones
        is like a storm against the wall.
025:005 As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise
        of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song
        of the dreaded ones will be brought low.
025:006 In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast
        of fat things, a feast of choice wines, of fat things full
        of marrow, of well refined choice wines.
025:007 He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering
        that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread
        over all nations.
025:008 He has swallowed up death forever!  The Lord Yahweh will wipe
        away tears from off all faces.  He will take the reproach
        of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh
        has spoken it.
025:009 It shall be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God!  We have
        waited for him, and he will save us!  This is Yahweh!  We have
        waited for him.  We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!"
025:010 For in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest.
        Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw
        is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.
025:011 He will spread out his hands in its midst, like one who swims
        spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled
        together with the craft of his hands.
025:012 He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low,
        and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
026:001 In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:  "We have
        a strong city.  God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
026:002 Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:
        the one which keeps faith.
026:003 You will keep whoever's mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
        because he trusts in you.
026:004 Trust in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
026:005 For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
        He lays it low.  He lays it low even to the ground.
        He brings it even to the dust.
026:006 The foot shall tread it down; Even the feet of the poor,
        and the steps of the needy."
026:007 The way of the just is uprightness.  You who are upright make
        the path of the righteous level.
026:008 Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you.
        Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.
026:009 With my soul have I desired you in the night.
        Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly;
        for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants
        of the world learn righteousness.
026:010 Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not
        learn righteousness.  In the land of uprightness he will
        deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh's majesty.
026:011 Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don't see; but they
        will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed.
        Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
026:012 Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also worked
        all our works for us.
026:013 Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,
        but by you only will we make mention of your name.
026:014 The dead shall not live.  The deceased shall not rise.
        Therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and caused
        all memory of them to perish.
026:015 You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.  You have increased
        the nation!  You are glorified!  You have enlarged all
        the borders of the land.
026:016 Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.  They poured out
        a prayer when your chastening was on them.
026:017 Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time
        of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs;
        so we have been before you, Yahweh.
026:018 We have been with child.  We have been in pain.  We gave birth,
        it seems, only to wind.  We have not worked any deliverance
        in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
026:019 Your dead shall live.  My dead bodies shall arise.
        Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is
        like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth the dead.
026:020 Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your
        doors behind you.  Hide yourself for a little moment,
        until the indignation is past.
026:021 For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish
        the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
        The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer
        cover her slain.
027:001 In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword
        will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan
        the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is
        in the sea.
027:002 In that day, sing to her, "A pleasant vineyard!
027:003 I, Yahweh, am its keeper.  I will water it every moment.
        Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.
027:004 Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns,
        I would do battle!  I would march on them and I would
        burn them together.
027:005 Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make
        peace with me.  Let him make peace with me."
027:006 In days to come, Jacob will take root.  Israel will blossom and bud.
        They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.
027:007 Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them?
        Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?
027:008 In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them.
        He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of
        the east wind.
027:009 Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven,
        and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
        that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones
        that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense
        altars shall rise no more.
027:010 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted
        and forsaken, like the wilderness.  The calf will feed there,
        and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.
027:011 When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off.
        The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people
        of no understanding.  Therefore he who made them will not
        have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show
        them no favor.
027:012 It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from
        the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt;
        and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.
027:013 It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown;
        and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
        and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come;
        and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
028:001 Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to
        the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
        of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!
028:002 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one.  Like a storm of hail,
        a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing,
        he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.
028:003 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be
        trodden under foot.
028:004 The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
        of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig
        before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon
        as he sees it.
028:005 In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory,
        and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people;
028:006 and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
        and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
028:007 They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink.
        The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink.
        They are swallowed up by wine.  They stagger with strong drink.
        They err in vision.  They stumble in judgment.
028:008 For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
028:009 Whom will he teach knowledge?  To whom will he explain the message?
        Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?
028:010 For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line,
        line on line; here a little, there a little.
028:011 But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and
        in another language;
028:012 to whom he said, "This is the resting place.  Give rest to weary;"
        and "This is the refreshing;" yet they would not hear.
028:013 Therefore the word of Yahweh will be to them precept on precept,
        precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little,
        there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken,
        be snared, and be taken.
028:014 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, you scoffers, that rule
        this people in Jerusalem:
028:015 "Because you have said, 'We have made a covenant with death,
        and with Sheol are we in agreement.  When the overflowing scourge
        passes through, it won't come to us; for we have made lies
        our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.'"
028:016 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, "Behold, I lay in Zion
        for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone
        of a sure foundation.  He who believes shall not act hastily.
028:017 I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness
        the plumb line.  The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
        and the waters will overflow the hiding place.
028:018 Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement
        with Sheol shall not stand.  When the overflowing scourge
        passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.
028:019 As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning
        by morning it will pass through, by day and by night;
        and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message."
028:020 For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket
        is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
028:021 For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim.
        He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may
        do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act,
        his extraordinary act.
028:022 Now therefore don't be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong;
        for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh
        of Armies, on the whole earth.
028:023 Give ear, and hear my voice!  Listen, and hear my speech!
028:024 Does he who plows to sow plow continually?  Does he keep
        turning the soil and breaking the clods?
028:025 When he has leveled its surface, doesn't he plant the dill,
        and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows,
        the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?
028:026 For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.
028:027 For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument,
        neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill
        is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.
028:028 Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it.
        Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it,
        his horses don't grind it.
028:029 This also comes forth from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful
        in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
029:001 Woe to Ariel!  Ariel, the city where David encamped!
        Add year to year; let the feasts come around;
029:002 then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning
        and lamentation.  She shall be to me as an altar hearth{or, Ariel}.
029:003 I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay
        siege against you with posted troops.  I will raise siege
        works against you.
029:004 You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground.
        Your speech will mumble out of the dust.  Your voice will
        be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
        and your speech will whisper out of the dust.
029:005 But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust,
        and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away.
        Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.
029:006 She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder,
        with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm,
        and with the flame of a devouring fire.
029:007 The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
        even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who
        distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
029:008 It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold,
        he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn't satisfied;
        or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks;
        but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty.
        The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion
        will be like that.
029:009 Pause and wonder!  Blind yourselves and be blind!
        They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not
        with strong drink.
029:010 For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep,
        and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered
        your heads, the seers.
029:011 All vision has become to you like the words of a book that
        is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying,
        "Read this, please;" and he says, "I can't, for it is sealed:"
029:012 and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying,
        "Read this, please;" and he says, "I can't read."
029:013 The Lord said, "Because this people draws near with their mouth
        and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their
        heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment
        of men which has been taught;
029:014 therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work
        among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder;
        and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding
        of their prudent men will be hidden."
029:015 Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh,
        and whose works are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us?"
        and "Who knows us?"
029:016 You turn things upside down!  Should the potter be thought
        to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him
        who made it, "He didn't make me;" or the thing formed say
        of him who formed it, "He has no understanding?"
029:017 Isn't it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned
        into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded
        as a forest?
029:018 In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book,
        and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and
        out of darkness.
029:019 The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor
        among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
029:020 For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases,
        and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
029:021 who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare
        for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent
        of justice with false testimony.
029:022 Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
        the house of Jacob:  "Jacob shall no longer be ashamed,
        neither shall his face grow pale.
029:023 But when he sees his children, the work of my hands,
        in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name.
        Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand
        in awe of the God of Israel.
029:024 They also who err in spirit will come to understanding,
        and those who grumble will receive instruction."
030:001 "Woe to the rebellious children," says Yahweh, "who take counsel,
        but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit,
        that they may add sin to sin,
030:002 who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice;
        to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
        and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
030:003 Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame,
        and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
030:004 For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have
        come to Hanes.
030:005 They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can't
        profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame,
        and also a reproach."
030:006 The burden of the animals of the South.  Through the land
        of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper
        and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders
        of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels,
        to an unprofitable people.
030:007 For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I
        called her Rahab who sits still.
030:008 Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book,
        that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.
030:009 For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who
        will not hear the law of Yahweh;
030:010 who tell the seers, "Don't see!" and to the prophets,
        "Don't prophesy to us right things.  Tell us pleasant things.
        Prophesy deceits.
030:011 Get out of the way.  Turn aside from the path.
        Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us."
030:012 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you
        despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
        and rely on it;
030:013 therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready
        to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes
        suddenly in an instant.
030:014 He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it
        in pieces without sparing, so that there won't be found among
        the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth,
        or to dip up water out of the cistern."
030:015 For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, "You will
        be saved in returning and rest.  Your strength will be in
        quietness and in confidence."  You refused,
030:016 but you said, "No, for we will flee on horses;"
        therefore you will flee; and, "We will ride on the swift;"
        therefore those who pursue you will be swift.
030:017 One thousand will flee at the threat of one.  At the threat
        of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon
        on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.
030:018 Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you;
        and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you,
        for Yahweh is a God of justice.  Blessed are all those who
        wait for him.
030:019 For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem.  You will weep
        no more.  He will surely be gracious to you at the voice
        of your cry.  When he hears you, he will answer you.
030:020 Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water
        of affliction, yet your teachers won't be hidden anymore,
        but your eyes will see your teachers;
030:021 and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left,
        your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way.
        Walk in it."
030:022 You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images
        of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold.
        You shall cast them away as an unclean thing.  You shall
        tell it, "Go away!"
030:023 He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow
        the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be
        rich and plentiful.  In that day, your livestock will feed
        in large pastures.
030:024 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will
        eat savory provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel
        and with the fork.
030:025 There shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain
        and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter,
        when the towers fall.
030:026 Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
        and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter,
        like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds
        up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they
        were struck with.
030:027 Behold, the name of Yahweh comes from far away, burning with
        his anger, and in thick rising smoke.  His lips are full
        of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.
030:028 His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to
        the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;
        and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws
        of the peoples.
030:029 You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept;
        and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come
        to Yahweh's mountain, to Israel's Rock.
030:030 Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show
        the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger,
        and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast,
        storm, and hailstones.
030:031 For through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed.
        He will strike him with his rod.
030:032 Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay
        on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps.
        He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.
030:033 For his burning place has long been ready.  Yes, for the king
        it is made ready.  He has made its pyre deep and large
        with fire and much wood.  Yahweh's breath, like a stream
        of sulfur, kindles it.
031:001 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses,
        and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen
        because they are very strong, but they don't look to the Holy One
        of Israel, and they don't seek Yahweh!
031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not call back
        his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers,
        and against the help of those who work iniquity.
031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
        and not spirit.  When Yahweh stretches out his hand,
        both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall,
        and they all shall be consumed together.
031:004 For thus says Yahweh to me, "As the lion and the young lion
        growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds is called
        together against him, will not be dismayed at their voice,
        nor abase himself for the noise of them, so Yahweh of Armies
        will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.
031:005 As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.
        He will protect and deliver it.  He will pass over
        and preserve it."
031:006 Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted,
        children of Israel.
031:007 For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and
        his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you.
031:008 "The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword,
        not of mankind, shall devour him.  He will flee from the sword,
        and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
031:009 His rock will pass away by reason of terror, and his princes will
        be afraid of the banner," says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,
        and his furnace in Jerusalem.
032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
        rule in justice.
032:002 A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert
        from the storm, as streams of water in a dry place,
        as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
032:003 The eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears
        of those who hear will listen.
032:004 The heart of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongue
        of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
032:005 The fool will no longer be called noble, nor the scoundrel
        be highly respected.
032:006 For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity,
        to practice profanity, and to utter error against Yahweh, To make
        empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of
        the thirsty to fail.
032:007 The ways of the scoundrel are evil.  He devises wicked
        devices to destroy the humble with lying words, even when
        the needy speaks right.
032:008 But the noble devises noble things; and he will continue
        in noble things.
032:009 Rise up, you women who are at ease!  Hear my voice!
        You careless daughters, give ear to my speech!
032:010 For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;
        for the vintage shall fail.  The harvest won't come.
032:011 Tremble, you women who are at ease!  Be troubled, you careless ones!
        Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked, and put sackcloth
        on your waist.
032:012 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
032:013 Thorns and briars will come up on my people's land; yes, on all
        the houses of joy in the joyous city.
032:014 For the palace will be forsaken.  The populous city will be deserted.
        The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever,
        a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
032:015 Until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the
        wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field
        is considered a forest.
032:016 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness
        will remain in the fruitful field.
032:017 The work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect
        of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
032:018 My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in safe dwellings,
        and in quiet resting places.
032:019 Though hail flattens the forest, and the city is leveled completely.
032:020 Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the feet
        of the ox and the donkey.
033:001 Woe to you who destroy, but you weren't destroyed; and who betray,
        but nobody betrayed you!  When you have finished destroying,
        you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of betrayal,
        you will be betrayed.
033:002 Yahweh, be gracious to us.  We have waited for you.
        Be our strength every morning, our salvation also in the
        time of trouble.
033:003 At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.
        When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.
033:004 Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.
        Men will leap on it as locusts leap.
033:005 Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high.  He has filled Zion
        with justice and righteousness.
033:006 There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation,
        wisdom, and knowledge.  The fear of Yahweh is your treasure.
033:007 Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors
        of peace weep bitterly.
033:008 The highways are desolate.  The traveling man ceases.
        The covenant is broken.  He has despised the cities.
        He doesn't regard man.
033:009 The land mourns and languishes.  Lebanon is confounded and
        withers away.  Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel
        are stripped bare.
033:010 "Now I will arise," says Yahweh; "Now I will lift myself up.
        Now I will be exalted.
033:011 You will conceive chaff.  You will bring forth stubble.
        Your breath is a fire that will devour you.
033:012 The peoples will be like the burning of lime, like thorns
        that are cut down and burned in the fire.
033:013 Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near,
        acknowledge my might."
033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid.  Trembling has seized the
        godless ones.  Who among us can live with the devouring fire?
        Who among us can live with everlasting burning?
033:015 He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; He who
        despises the gain of oppressions, who gestures with his hands,
        refusing to take a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing
        of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil--
033:016 he will dwell on high.  His place of defense will be
        the fortress of rocks.  His bread will be supplied.
        His waters will be sure.
033:017 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.  They will see
        a distant land.
033:018 Your heart will meditate on the terror.  Where is he who counted?
        Where is he who weighed?  Where is he who counted the towers?
033:019 You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of a deep
        speech that you can't comprehend, with a strange language
        that you can't understand.
033:020 Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.
        Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tent
        that won't be removed.  Its stakes will never be plucked up,
        nor will any of its cords be broken.
033:021 But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad
        rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars will go,
        neither will any gallant ship pass by there.
033:022 For Yahweh is our judge.  Yahweh is our lawgiver.
        Yahweh is our king.  He will save us.
033:023 Your rigging is untied.  They couldn't strengthen the foot
        of their mast.  They couldn't spread the sail.  Then the prey
        of a great spoil was divided.  The lame took the prey.
033:024 The inhabitant won't say, "I am sick."  The people who dwell
        therein will be forgiven their iniquity.
034:001 Come near, you nations, to hear!  Listen, you peoples.
        Let the earth and all it contains hear; the world,
        and everything that comes from it.
034:002 For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, and angry
        with all their armies.  He has utterly destroyed them.
        He has given them over for slaughter.
034:003 Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of their dead
        bodies will come up; and the mountains will melt in their blood.
034:004 All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.  The sky will be
        rolled up like a scroll, and all its armies will fade away,
        as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
034:005 For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.  Behold, it will come
        down on Edom, and on the people of my curse, for judgment.
034:006 Yahweh's sword is filled with blood.  It is covered with fat,
        with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys
        of rams; for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great
        slaughter in the land of Edom.
034:007 The wild oxen will come down with them, and the young bulls
        with the mighty bulls; and their land will be drunken with blood,
        and their dust made greasy with fat.
034:008 For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense
        for the cause of Zion.
034:009 Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur,
        And its land will become burning pitch.
034:010 It won't be quenched night nor day.  Its smoke will go up forever.
        From generation to generation, it will lie waste.
        No one will pass through it forever and ever.
034:011 But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.
        The owl and the raven will dwell in it.  He will stretch
        the line of confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness.
034:012 They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;
        and all its princes shall be nothing.
034:013 Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles
        in its fortresses; and it will be a habitation of jackals,
        a court for ostriches.
034:014 The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,
        and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.  Yes, the night
        creature{literally, lilith, which could also be a night demon
        or night monster} shall settle there, and shall find herself
        a place of rest.
034:015 The arrow snake will make her nest there, and lay, hatch, and gather
        under her shade.  Yes, the kites will be gathered there,
        every one with her mate.
034:016 Search in the book of Yahweh, and read:  not one of these will
        be missing.  none will lack her mate.  For my mouth has commanded,
        and his Spirit has gathered them.
034:017 He has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it
        to them with a measuring line.  They shall possess it forever.
        From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
035:001 The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.  The desert
        will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
035:002 It will blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing.
        Lebanon's glory Lebanon will be given to it, the excellence
        of Carmel and Sharon.  They will see Yahweh's glory,
        the excellence of our God.
035:003 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
035:004 Tell those who have a fearful heart, "Be strong.  Don't be afraid.
        Behold, your God will come with vengeance, God's retribution.
        He will come and save you.
035:005 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears
        of the deaf will be unstopped.
035:006 Then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the tongue of
        the mute will sing; for waters will break out in the wilderness,
        and streams in the desert.
035:007 The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground
        springs of water.  Grass with reeds and rushes will be in
        the habitation of jackals, where they lay.
035:008 A highway will be there, a road, and it will be called The Holy Way.
        The unclean shall not pass over it, but it will be for those
        who walk in the Way.  Wicked fools will not go there.
035:009 No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.
        They will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.
035:010 The Yahweh's ransomed ones will return, and come with singing
        to Zion; and everlasting joy will be on their heads.
        They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing
        will flee away."
036:001 Now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
        that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified
        cities of Judah, and captured them.
036:002 The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
        to king Hezekiah with a large army.  He stood by the aqueduct
        from the upper pool in the fuller's field highway.
036:003 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
        and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder
        came out to him.
036:004 Rabshakeh said to them, "Now tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says
        the great king, the king of Assyria, "What confidence is this
        in which you trust?
036:005 I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words.
        Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?
036:006 Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt,
        which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it.
        So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
036:007 But if you tell me, 'We trust in Yahweh our God,' isn't that
        he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away,
        and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship
        before this altar?'"
036:008 Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king
        of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you
        are able on your part to set riders on them.
036:009 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least
        of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots
        and for horsemen?
036:010 Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it?
        Yahweh said to me, "Go up against this land, and destroy it."'"
036:011 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak
        to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it;
        and don't speak to us in the Jews' language in the hearing
        of the people who are on the wall."
036:012 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master
        and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit
        on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own
        urine with you?"
036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in
        the Jews' language, and said, "Hear the words of the great king,
        the king of Assyria!
036:014 Thus says the king, 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you;
        for he will not be able to deliver you.
036:015 Don't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will
        surely deliver us.  This city won't be given into the hand
        of the king of Assyria."'
036:016 Don't listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king
        of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me;
        and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree,
        and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;
036:017 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
        a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, "Yahweh will deliver us."
        Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands
        from the hand of the king of Assyria?
036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?  Where are the gods
        of Sepharvaim?  Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have
        delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should
        deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
036:021 But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply,
        for the king's commandment was, "Don't answer him."
036:022 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
        and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder,
        came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him
        the words of Rabshakeh.
037:001 It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes,
        covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh's house.
037:002 He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
        and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth,
        to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
037:003 They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble,
        and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come
        to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
037:004 It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
        whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God,
        and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard.
        Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
037:006 Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Don't be
        afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants
        of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
037:007 Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news,
        and will return to his own land.  I will cause him to fall
        by the sword in his own land."'"
037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
037:009 He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, "He has
        come out to fight against you."  When he heard it, he sent
        messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
037:010 "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Don't let
        your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, "Jerusalem won't
        be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
037:011 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria
        have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly.
        Shall you be delivered?
037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers
        have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden
        who were in Telassar?
037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king
        of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'"
037:014 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers
        and read it.  Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh's house,
        and spread it before Yahweh.
037:015 Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,
037:016 "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among
        the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms
        of the earth.  You have made heaven and earth.
037:017 Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear.  Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold.
        Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy
        the living God.
037:018 Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all
        the countries and their land,
037:019 and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they
        have destroyed them.
037:020 Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand,
        that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh,
        even you only."
037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus
        says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed
        to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
037:022 this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him.
        The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you.
        The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
037:023 Whom have you defied and blasphemed?  Against whom have
        you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high?
        Against the Holy One of Israel.
037:024 By your servants, have you defied the Lord, and have said,
        "With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height
        of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon.
        I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees.
        I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of
        its fruitful field.
037:025 I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I
        will dry up all the rivers of Egypt."
037:026 Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it
        in ancient times?  Now I have brought it to pass, that it
        should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them
        into ruinous heaps.
037:027 Therefore their inhabitants had little power.  They were dismayed
        and confounded.  They were like the grass of the field,
        and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops,
        and like a field before its crop has grown.
037:028 But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in,
        and your raging against me.
037:029 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance
        has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook
        in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you
        back by the way by which you came.
037:030 This shall be the sign to you.  You will eat this year that
        which grows of itself, and in the second year that which
        springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap
        and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
037:031 The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again
        take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
037:032 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth, and survivors
        will escape from Mount Zion.  The zeal of Yahweh of Armies
        will perform this.'
037:033 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will
        not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will
        he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
037:034 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return,
        and he shall not come to this city,' says Yahweh.
037:035 'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake,
        and for my servant David's sake.'"
037:036 The angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and
        eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians.
        When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were
        all dead bodies.
037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away,
        returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.
037:038 It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
        his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him
        with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
        Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick and near death.
        Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him,
        "Thus says Yahweh, 'Set your house in order, for you will die,
        and not live.'"
038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,
038:003 and said, "Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked
        before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done
        that which is good in your sight."  Hezekiah wept bitterly.
038:004 Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,
038:005 "Go, and tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David
        your father, "I have heard your prayer.  I have seen your tears.
        Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
038:006 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king
        of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
038:007 This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will
        do this thing that he has spoken.
038:008 Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down
        on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.
        So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it
        had gone down."'"
038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
        and had recovered of his sickness.
038:010 I said, "In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.
        I am deprived of the residue of my years."
038:011 I said, "I won't see Yah, Yah in the land of the living.
        I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
038:012 My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me like a
        shepherd's tent.  I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life.
        He will cut me off from the loom.  From day even to night
        you will make an end of me.
038:013 I waited patiently until morning.  He breaks all my bones like
        a lion.  From day even to night you will make an end of me.
038:014 I chattered like a swallow or a crane.  I moaned like a dove.
        My eyes weaken looking upward.  Lord, I am oppressed.
        Be my security."
038:015 What will I say?  He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.
        I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish
        of my soul.
038:016 Lord, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life
        in all of them:  you restore me, and cause me to live.
038:017 Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but you have in love
        for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
        for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
038:018 For Sheol can't praise you.  Death can't celebrate you.
        Those who go down into the pit can't hope for your truth.
038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day.
        The father shall make known your truth to the children.
038:020 Yahweh will save me.  Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed
        instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh.
038:021 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and lay
        it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover."
038:022 Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I will go up
        to the house of Yahweh?"
039:001 At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan,
        king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah;
        for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
039:002 Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house
        of his precious things, the silver, and the gold,
        the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house
        of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures.
        There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion,
        that Hezekiah didn't show them.
039:003 Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him,
        "What did these men say?  Where did they come from to you?"
        Hezekiah said, "They have come from a country far from me,
        even from Babylon."
039:004 Then he asked, "What have they seen in your house?"
        Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house.
        There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:
039:006 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house,
        and that which your fathers have stored up until this day,
        will be carried to Babylon.  Nothing will be left,' says Yahweh.
039:007 'They will take away your sons who will issue from you,
        whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king
        of Babylon's palace.'"
039:008 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "Yahweh's word which you have
        spoken is good."  He said moreover, "For there will be peace
        and truth in my days."
040:001 "Comfort, comfort my people," says your God.
040:002 "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her
        warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned,
        that she has received of Yahweh's hand double for all her sins."
040:003 The voice of one who calls out, "Prepare the way of Yahweh
        in the wilderness!  Make a level highway in the desert
        for our God.
040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
        be made low.  The uneven shall be made level, and the rough
        places a plain.
040:005 The glory of Yahweh shall be revealed, and all flesh shall
        see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
040:006 The voice of one saying, "Cry!"  One said, "What shall I cry?"
        "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower
        of the field.
040:007 The grass withers, the flower fades, because Yahweh's breath
        blows on it.  Surely the people are like grass.
040:008 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our
        God stands forever."
040:009 You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.
        You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your
        voice with strength.  Lift it up.  Don't be afraid.
        Say to the cities of Judah, "Behold, your God!"
040:010 Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his
        arm will rule for him.  Behold, his reward is with him,
        and his recompense before him.
040:011 He will feed his flock like a shepherd.  He will gather
        the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom.
        He will gently lead those who have their young.
040:012 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
        and marked off the sky with his span, and calculated the dust
        of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
        and the hills in a balance?
040:013 Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, or has taught him
        as his counselor?
040:014 Who did he take counsel with, and who instructed him,
        and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge,
        and showed him the way of understanding?
040:015 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are
        regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.  Behold, he lifts
        up the islands like a very little thing.
040:016 Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient
        for a burnt offering.
040:017 All the nations are like nothing before him.  They are regarded
        by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
040:018 To whom then will you liken God?  Or what likeness will you
        compare to him?
040:019 A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it
        with gold, and casts silver chains for it.
040:020 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree
        that will not rot.  He seeks a skillful workman to set up
        an engraved image for him that will not be moved.
040:021 Haven't you known?  Haven't you heard, yet?  Haven't you
        been told from the beginning?  Haven't you understood from
        the foundations of the earth?
040:022 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its
        inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens
        like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
040:023 who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the
        earth like meaningless.
040:024 They are planted scarcely.  They are sown scarcely.
        Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.
        He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind
        takes them away as stubble.
040:025 "To whom then will you liken me?  Who is my equal?"
        says the Holy One.
040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these,
        who brings out their army by number.  He calls them all by name.
        by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power,
        Not one is lacking.
040:027 Why do you say, Jacob, and speak, Israel, "My way is hidden
        from Yahweh, and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?"
040:028 Haven't you known?  Haven't you heard?  The everlasting
        God, Yahweh, The Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn't faint.
        He isn't weary.  His understanding is unsearchable.
040:029 He gives power to the weak.  He increases the strength of him
        who has no might.
040:030 Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall;
040:031 But those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength.
        They will mount up with wings like eagles.  They will run,
        and not be weary.  They will walk, and not faint.
041:001 "Keep silent before me, islands, and let the peoples renew
        their strength.  Let them come near, then let them speak.
        Let's meet together for judgment.
041:002 Who has raised up one from the east?  Whom called him to his foot
        in righteousness?  He hands over nations to him, and makes him
        rule over kings.  He gives them like the dust to his sword,
        like the driven stubble to his bow.
041:003 He pursues them, and passes by safely, Even by a way that he had
        not gone with his feet.
041:004 Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from
        the beginning?  I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last,
        I am he."
041:005 The islands have seen, and fear.  The ends of the earth tremble.
        They approach, and come.
041:006 Everyone helps his neighbor.  They say to their brothers,
        "Be strong!"
041:007 So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.  He who smoothes
        with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,
        saying of the soldering, "It is good;" and he fastens it
        with nails, that it might not totter.
041:008 "But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
        the seed of Abraham my friend,
041:009 You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,
        and called from its corners, and said to you, 'You are my servant,
        I have chosen you and not cast you away;'
041:010 Don't you be afraid, for I am with you.  Don't be dismayed,
        for I am your God.  I will strengthen you.  Yes, I will help you.
        Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
041:011 Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed
        and confounded.  Those who strive with you will be like nothing,
        and shall perish.
041:012 You will seek them, and won't find them, even those who contend
        with you.  Those who war against you will be as nothing,
        as a non-existent thing.
041:013 For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you,
        'Don't be afraid.  I will help you.'
041:014 Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel.
        I will help you," says Yahweh, "and your Redeemer is
        the Holy One of Israel.
041:015 Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument
        with teeth.  You will thresh the mountains, and beat them small,
        and will make the hills like chaff.
041:016 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,
        and the whirlwind will scatter them.  You will rejoice in Yahweh.
        You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
041:017 The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.
        Their tongue fails for thirst.  I, Yahweh, will answer them.
        I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
041:018 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the midst
        of the valleys.  I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
        and the dry land springs of water.
041:019 I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.
        I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
041:020 that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,
        that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the Holy One
        of Israel has created it.
041:021 Produce your cause," says Yahweh.  "Bring forth your strong reasons,"
        says the King of Jacob.
041:022 "Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen.
        Declare the former things, what they are, that we may consider them,
        and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.
041:023 Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we
        may know that you are gods.  Yes, do good, or do evil,
        that we may be dismayed, and see it together.
041:024 Behold, you are of nothing, and your work is of nothing.
        He who chooses you is an abomination.
041:025 "I have raised up one from the north, and he has come;
        from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name; and he shall
        come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
041:026 Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?
        And before, that we may say, 'He is right?'  Surely, there is
        no one who declares.  Surely, there is no one who shows.
        Surely, there is no one who hears your words.
041:027 I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;'
        and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.
041:028 When I look, there is no man; even among them there is no
        counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
041:029 Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing.
        Their molten images are wind and confusion.
042:001 "Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen,
        in whom my soul delights--I have put my Spirit on him.
        He will bring justice to the nations.
042:002 He will not shout, nor raise his voice, nor cause it to be heard
        in the street.
042:003 He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a dimly burning wick.
        He will faithfully bring justice.
042:004 He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set justice
        in the earth, and the islands will wait for his law."
042:005 Thus says God Yahweh, he who created the heavens and stretched
        them out, he who spread out the earth and that which comes
        out of it, he who gives breath to its people and spirit
        to those who walk in it.
042:006 "I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand,
        and will keep you, and make you a covenant for the people,
        as a light for the nations;
042:007 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,
        and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
042:008 "I am Yahweh.  That is my name.  I will not give my glory
        to another, nor my praise to engraved images.
042:009 Behold, the former things have happened, and I declare new things.
        I tell you about them before they come up."
042:010 Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of
        the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein,
        the islands and their inhabitants.
042:011 Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices, with the
        villages that Kedar inhabits.  Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.
        Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
042:012 Let them give glory to Yahweh, and declare his praise
        in the islands.
042:013 Yahweh will go out like a mighty man.  He will stir up zeal like a
        man of war.  He will raise a war cry.  Yes, he will shout aloud.
        He will triumph over his enemies.
042:014 "I have been silent a long time.  I have been quiet and
        restrained myself.  Now I will cry out like a travailing woman.
        I will both gasp and pant.
042:015 I will destroy mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs.
        I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
042:016 I will bring the blind by a way that they don't know.
        I will lead them in paths that they don't know.  I will make
        darkness light before them, and crooked places straight.
        I will do these things, and I will not forsake them.
042:017 "Those who trust in engraved images, who tell molten images,
        'You are our gods' will be turned back.  They will
        be utterly disappointed.
042:018 "Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see.
042:019 Who is blind, but my servant?  Or who is as deaf as my
        messenger whom I send?  Who is as blind as he who is at peace,
        and as blind as Yahweh's servant?
042:020 You see many things, but don't observe.  His ears are open,
        but he doesn't listen.
042:021 It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify
        the law, and make it honorable.
042:022 But this is a robbed and plundered people.  All of them
        are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prisons.
        They have become a prey, and no one delivers; and a spoil,
        and no one says, 'Restore them!'
042:023 Who is there among you who will give ear to this?
        Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
042:024 Who gave Jacob as plunder, and Israel to the robbers?
        Didn't Yahweh, he against whom we have sinned?  For they
        would not walk in his ways, and they disobeyed his law.
042:025 Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,
        and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire all around,
        but he didn't know; and it burned him, but he didn't take
        it to heart."
043:001 But now thus says Yahweh who created you, Jacob, and he who
        formed you, Israel:  "Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you.
        I have called you by your name.  You are mine.
043:002 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
        and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
        When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,
        and flame will not scorch you.
043:003 For I am Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
        I have given Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba
        in your place.
043:004 Since you have been precious and honored in my sight, and I
        have loved you; therefore I will give people in your place,
        and nations instead of your life.
043:005 Don't be afraid; for I am with you.  I will bring your seed
        from the east, and gather you from the west.
043:006 I will tell the north, 'Give them up!' and tell the south,
        'Don't hold them back!  Bring my sons from far, and my daughters
        from the ends of the earth--
043:007 everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created
        for my glory, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made.'"
043:008 Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf
        who have ears.
043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples
        be assembled.  Who among them can declare this, and show us
        former things?  Let them bring their witnesses, that they
        may be justified; or let them hear, and say, "That is true."
043:010 "You are my witnesses," says Yahweh, "With my servant
        whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe me,
        and understand that I am he.  Before me there was no God formed,
        neither will there be after me.
043:011 I myself am Yahweh; and besides me there is no savior.
043:012 I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown; and there was
        no strange god among you.  Therefore you are my witnesses,"
        says Yahweh, "and I am God.
043:013 Yes, since the day was I am he; and there is no one who can
        deliver out of my hand.  I will work, and who can hinder it?"
043:014 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
        "For your sake, I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring all
        of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships
        of their rejoicing.
043:015 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King."
043:016 Thus says Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea, and a path
        in the mighty waters;
043:017 who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man
        (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct,
        they are quenched like a wick):
043:018 "Don't remember the former things, and don't consider
        the things of old.
043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing.  It springs forth now.
        Don't you know it?  I will even make a way in the wilderness,
        and rivers in the desert.
043:020 The animals of the field shall honor me, the jackals and
        the ostriches; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers
        in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
043:021 the people which I formed for myself, that they might set
        forth my praise.
043:022 Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; but you have been weary
        of me, Israel.
043:023 You have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings;
        neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.
        I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied
        you with frankincense.
043:024 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled
        me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened me
        with your sins.  You have wearied me with your iniquities.
043:025 I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;
        and I will not remember your sins.
043:026 Put me in remembrance.  Let us plead together.  Set forth
        your case, that you may be justified.
043:027 Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed
        against me.
043:028 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;
        and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling."
044:001 Yet listen now, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.
044:002 This is what Yahweh who made you, and formed you from the womb,
        who will help you says:  "Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant;
        and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
044:003 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams
        on the dry ground.  I will pour my Spirit on your seed,
        and my blessing on your offspring:
044:004 and they will spring up among the grass, as willows
        by the watercourses.
044:005 One will say, 'I am Yahweh's;' and another will be called by the name
        of Jacob; and another will write with his hand 'to Yahweh,'
        and honor the name of Israel."
044:006 This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh
        of Armies, says:  "I am the first, and I am the last;
        and besides me there is no God.
044:007 Who is like me?  Who will call, and will declare it, and set
        it in order for me, since I established the ancient people?
        Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen.
044:008 Don't fear, neither be afraid.  Haven't I declared it
        to you long ago, and shown it?  You are my witnesses.
        Is there a God besides me?  Indeed, there is not.
        I don't know any other Rock."
044:009 Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain.  The things that they
        delight in will not profit.  Their own witnesses don't see,
        nor know, that they may be disappointed.
044:010 Who has fashioned a god, or molds an image that is
        profitable for nothing?
044:011 Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed; and the workmen are
        mere men.  Let them all be gathered together.  Let them stand up.
        They will fear.  They will be put to shame together.
044:012 The blacksmith takes an axe, works in the coals,
        fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm.
        He is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water,
        and is faint.
044:013 The carpenter stretches out a line.  He marks it out with a pencil.
        He shapes it with planes.  He marks it out with compasses,
        and shapes it like the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man,
        to reside in a house.
044:014 He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak,
        and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest.
        He plants a fir tree, and the rain nourishes it.
044:015 Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it,
        and warms himself.  Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread.
        Yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it an engraved image,
        and falls down to it.
044:016 He burns part of it in the fire.  With part of it, he eats meat.
        He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.  Yes, he warms himself,
        and says, "Aha!  I am warm.  I have seen the fire."
044:017 The rest of it he makes into a god, even his engraved image.
        He bows down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says,
        "Deliver me; for you are my god!"
044:018 They don't know, neither do they consider:  for he has
        shut their eyes, that they can't see; and their hearts,
        that they can't understand.
044:019 No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,
        "I have burned part of it in the fire.  Yes, I have also baked
        bread on its coals.  I have roasted meat and eaten it.
        Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?
        Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?"
044:020 He feeds on ashes.  A deceived heart has turned him aside;
        and he can't deliver his soul, nor say, "Isn't there a lie
        in my right hand?"
044:021 Remember these things, Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant.
        I have formed you.  You are my servant.  Israel, you will
        not be forgotten by me.
044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and,
        as a cloud, your sins.  Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
044:023 Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it!  Shout, you lower
        parts of the earth!  Break out into singing, you mountains,
        O forest, all of your trees, for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob,
        and will glorify himself in Israel.
044:024 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb:
        "I am Yahweh, who makes all things; who alone stretches out
        the heavens; who spreads out the earth by myself;
044:025 who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad;
        who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
044:026 who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel
        of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem, 'She will be inhabited;'
        and of the cities of Judah, 'They will be built,' and I
        will raise up its waste places;'
044:027 who says to the deep, 'Be dry,' and 'I will dry up your rivers;'
044:028 Who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
        my pleasure,' even saying of Jerusalem, 'She will be built;'
        and of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"
045:001 Thus says Yahweh to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand
        I have held, to subdue nations before him, and strip kings
        of their armor; to open the doors before him, and the gates
        shall not be shut:
045:002 "I will go before you, and make the rough places smooth.
        I will break the doors of brass in pieces, and cut apart
        the bars of iron.
045:003 I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches
        of secret places, that you may know that it is I, Yahweh,
        who call you by your name, even the God of Israel.
045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my chosen, I have
        called you by your name.  I have surnamed you, though you
        have not known me.
045:005 I am Yahweh, and there is none else.  Besides me, there is no God.
        I will strengthen{or, equip} you, though you have not known me;
045:006 that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,
        that there is none besides me.  I am Yahweh, and there is
        no one else.
045:007 I form the light, and create darkness.  I make peace,
        and create calamity.  I am Yahweh, who does all these things.
045:008 Distil, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour
        down righteousness.  Let the earth open, that it may bring
        forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up
        with it.  I, Yahweh, have created it.
045:009 Woe to him who strives with his Maker--a clay pot among the clay
        pots of the earth!  Shall the clay ask him who fashions it,
        'What are you making?' or your work, 'He has no hands?'
045:010 Woe to him who says to a father, 'What have you become the father of?'
        or to a mother, 'To what have you given birth?'"
045:011 Thus says Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:  "You ask
        me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons,
        and you command me concerning the work of my hands!
045:012 I have made the earth, and created man on it:  I, even my hands,
        have stretched out the heavens; and all their army
        have I commanded.
045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight
        all his ways:  he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles
        go free, not for price nor reward, says Yahweh of Armies.
045:014 Thus says Yahweh:  "The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise
        of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
        to you, and they shall be yours.  They shall go after you.
        In chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down to you.
        They shall make supplication to you:  'Surely God is in you;
        and there is none else, there is no other god.
045:015 Most certainly you are a God who hid yourself, God of Israel,
        the Savior.'"
045:016 They shall be disappointed, yes, confounded, all of them;
        they shall go into confusion together who are makers of idols.
045:017 [But] Israel shall be saved by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation:
        you shall not be disappointed nor confounded world without end.
045:018 For thus says Yahweh who created the heavens, the God
        who formed the earth and made it, who established it and
        didn't create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited:
        I am Yahweh; and there is no one else.
045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness;
        I didn't say to the seed of Jacob, Seek you me in vain:
        I, Yahweh, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you who
        have escaped from the nations:  they have no knowledge
        who carry the wood of their engraved image, and pray to a god
        that can't save.
045:021 Declare you, and bring [it] forth; yes, let them take
        counsel together:  who has shown this from ancient time?
        who has declared it of old?  Haven't I, Yahweh? and there
        is no God else besides me, a just God and a Savior;
        there is no one besides me.
045:022 Look to me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth;
        for I am God, and there is none else.
045:023 By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth
        [in] righteousness, and shall not return, that to me every
        knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
045:024 Only in Yahweh, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength;
        even to him shall men come; and all those who were incensed
        against him shall be disappointed.
045:025 In Yahweh shall all the seed of Israel be justified,
        and shall glory.
046:001 Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals,
        and on the livestock:  the things that you carried about are
        made a load, a burden to the weary [animal].
046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver
        the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
046:003 Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house
        of Israel, that have been borne [by me] from their birth,
        that have been carried from the womb;
046:004 and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I
        carry you.  I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry,
        and will deliver.
046:005 To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
        that we may be like?
046:006 Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance.
        They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god.
        They fall down--yes, they worship.
046:007 They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in
        its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move:
        yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save him
        out of his trouble.
046:008 Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again
        to mind, you transgressors.
046:009 Remember the former things of old:  for I am God, and there
        is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me;
046:010 declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
        things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel shall stand,
        and I will do all my pleasure;
046:011 calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from
        a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass;
        I have purposed, I will also do it.
046:012 Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:
046:013 I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off,
        and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation
        in Zion for Israel my glory.
047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon;
        sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans:
        for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil,
        strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.
047:003 Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen:
        I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.
047:004 Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
047:005 Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans;
        for you shall no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.
047:006 I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance,
        and gave them into your hand:  you did show them no mercy;
        on the aged have you very heavily laid your yoke.
047:007 You said, I shall be mistress forever; so that you did not lay
        these things to your heart, neither did remember the latter
        end of it.
047:008 Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,
        who sit securely, who say in your heart, I am, and there
        is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow,
        neither shall I know the loss of children:
047:009 but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day,
        the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure
        shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries,
        and the great abundance of your enchantments.
047:010 For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, None sees me;
        your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you,
        and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is none
        else besides me.
047:011 Therefore shall evil come on you; you shall not know the dawning
        of it:  and mischief shall fall on you; you shall not be able
        to put it away:  and desolation shall come on you suddenly,
        which you don't know.
047:012 Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude
        of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth;
        if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.
047:013 You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels:  let now
        the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
        stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.
047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
        they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
        it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.
047:015 Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored:
        those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander
        everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you.
048:001 Hear you this, house of Jacob, who are called by the name
        of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah;
        who swear by the name of Yahweh, and make mention of the God
        of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness
048:002 (for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
        on the God of Israel; Yahweh of Armies is his name):
048:003 I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went
        forth out of my mouth, and I shown them:  suddenly I did them,
        and they happened.
048:004 Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an
        iron sinew, and your brow brass;
048:005 therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it
        came to pass I shown it you; lest you should say, My idol
        has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image,
        has commanded them.
048:006 You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it?
        I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things,
        which you have not known.
048:007 They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day
        you didn't hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.
048:008 Yes, you didn't hear; yes, you didn't know; yes, from of old
        your ear was not opened:  for I knew that you did deal
        very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb.
048:009 For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise
        will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off.
048:010 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen
        you in the furnace of affliction.
048:011 For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should [my
        name] be profaned? and my glory I will not give to another.
048:012 Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called:  I am he;
        I am the first, I also am the last.
048:013 Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my
        right hand has spread out the heavens:  when I call to them,
        they stand up together.
048:014 Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has
        declared these things?  He whom Yahweh loves shall perform his
        pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.
048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him,
        and he shall make his way prosperous.
048:016 Come you near to me, hear you this; from the beginning I have
        not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I:
        and now the Lord Yahweh has sent me, and his Spirit.
048:017 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:  I am
        Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you
        by the way that you should go.
048:018 Oh that you had listened to my commandments! then had your
        peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves
        of the sea:
048:019 your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your
        body like the grains of it:  his name would not be cut off
        nor destroyed from before me.
048:020 Go you forth from Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans;
        with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it
        even to the end of the earth:  say you, Yahweh has redeemed
        his servant Jacob.
048:021 They didn't thirst when he led them through the deserts;
        he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them;
        he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
048:022 There is no peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.
049:001 Listen, islands, to me; and listen, you peoples, from far:
        Yahweh has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
        mother has he made mention of my name:
049:002 and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow
        of his hand has he hid me:  and he has made me a polished shaft;
        in his quiver has he kept me close:
049:003 and he said to me, You are my servant; Israel, in whom I
        will be glorified.
049:004 But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength
        for nothing and vanity; yet surely the justice [due] to me
        is with Yahweh, and my recompense with my God.
049:005 Now says Yahweh who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
        to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered to him
        (for I am honorable in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God is
        become my strength);
049:006 yes, he says, It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
        to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved
        of Israel:  I will also give you for a light to the nations,
        that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.
049:007 Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One,
        to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors,
        to a servant of rulers:  Kings shall see and arise; princes,
        and they shall worship; because of Yahweh who is faithful,
        [even] the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.
049:008 Thus says Yahweh, In an acceptable time have I answered you,
        and in a day of salvation have I helped you; and I will preserve you,
        and give you for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land,
        to make them inherit the desolate heritage:
049:009 saying to those who are bound, Go forth; to those who are
        in darkness, Show yourselves.  They shall feed in the ways,
        and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.
049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
        sun strike them:  for he who has mercy on them will lead them,
        even by springs of water he will guide them.
049:011 I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways
        shall be exalted.
049:012 Behold, these shall come from far; and behold, these from
        the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
049:013 Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth
        into singing, mountains:  for Yahweh has comforted his people,
        and will have compassion on his afflicted.
049:014 But Zion said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord
        has forgotten me.
049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
        compassion on the son of her womb? yes, these may forget,
        yet I will not forget you.
049:016 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
        your walls are continually before me.
049:017 Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made
        you waste shall go forth from you.
049:018 Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  all these gather
        themselves together, and come to you.  As I live, says Yahweh,
        you shall surely clothe you with them all as with an ornament,
        and gird yourself with them, like a bride.
049:019 For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land
        that has been destroyed, surely now shall you be too small
        for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall
        be far away.
049:020 The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears,
        The place is too small for me; give place to me that I may dwell.
049:021 Then shall you say in your heart, Who has conceived these for me,
        seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary,
        an exile, and wandering back and forth? and who has brought
        up these?  Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?
049:022 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will lift up my hand
        to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples;
        and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your
        daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
049:023 Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens
        your nursing mothers:  they shall bow down to you with
        their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet;
        and you shall know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me
        shall not be disappointed.
049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
        captives be delivered?
049:025 But thus says Yahweh, Even the captives of the mighty shall
        be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered;
        for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I
        will save your children.
049:026 I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they
        shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine:
        and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,
        and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
050:001 Thus says Yahweh, Where is the bill of your mother's divorce,
        with which I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it
        to whom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities were you sold,
        and for your transgressions was your mother put away.
050:002 Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there
        none to answer?  Is my hand shortened at all, that it can't
        redeem? or have I no power to deliver?  Behold, at my
        rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness:
        their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.
050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
        their covering.
050:004 The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught,
        that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary:
        he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear
        as those who are taught.
050:005 The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious,
        neither turned away backward.
050:006 I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked
        off the hair; I didn't hide my face from shame and spitting.
050:007 For the Lord Yahweh will help me; therefore I have not
        been confounded:  therefore have I set my face like a flint,
        and I know that I shall not be disappointed.
050:008 He is near who justifies me; who will bring charges against me?
        Let us stand up together:  who is my adversary?
        Let him come near to me.
050:009 Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me; who is he who shall
        condemn me?  Behold, all they shall wax old as a garment,
        the moth shall eat them up.
050:010 Who is among you who fears Yahweh, who obeys the voice
        of his servant?  He who walks in darkness, and has no light,
        let him trust in the name of Yahweh, and rely on his God.
050:011 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves
        about with firebrands; walk you in the flame of your fire,
        and among the brands that you have kindled.  This shall you
        have of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
051:001 Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,
        you who seek Yahweh:  look to the rock whence you were hewn,
        and to the hold of the pit whence you were dug.
051:002 Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you;
        for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him,
        and made him many.
051:003 For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her
        waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden,
        and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness
        shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
051:004 Attend to me, my people; and give ear to me, my nation:
        for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my
        justice for a light of the peoples.
051:005 My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and my
        arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me,
        and on my arm shall they trust.
051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath;
        for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth
        shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell therein
        shall die in like manner:  but my salvation shall be forever,
        and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
051:007 Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose
        heart is my law; don't you fear the reproach of men,
        neither be you dismayed at their insults.
051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall
        eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be forever,
        and my salvation to all generations.
051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in
        the days of old, the generations of ancient times.
        Isn't it you who did cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?
051:010 Isn't it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep;
        who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed
        to pass over?
051:011 The ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and come with singing
        to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads:
        they shall obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and sighing
        shall flee away.
051:012 I, even I, am he who comforts you:  who are you, that you are
        afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall
        be made as grass;
051:013 and have forgotten Yahweh your Maker, who stretched forth
        the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fear
        continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor,
        when he makes ready to destroy? and where is the fury
        of the oppressor?
051:014 The captive exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die
        [and go down] into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.
051:015 For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves
        of it roar:  Yahweh of Armies is his name.
051:016 I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in
        the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay
        the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion, You are my people.
051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand
        of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you have drunken the bowl
        of the cup of staggering, and drained it.
051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has
        brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand
        among all the sons who she has brought up.
051:019 These two things have happened to you.  Who will bemoan you?
        Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword;
        how shall I comfort you?
051:020 Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets,
        as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh,
        the rebuke of your God.
051:021 Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken,
        but now with wine:
051:022 Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and your God who pleads the cause
        of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup
        of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath;
        you shall no more drink it again:
051:023 and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,
        who have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over;
        and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street,
        to those who go over.
052:001 Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful
        garments, Jerusalem, the holy city:  for henceforth there shall
        no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.
052:002 Shake yourself from the dust; arise, sit [on your throne], Jerusalem:
        loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter
        of Zion.
052:003 For thus says Yahweh, You were sold for nothing; and you shall
        be redeemed without money.
052:004 For thus says the Lord Yahweh, My people went down at the first
        into Egypt to sojourn there:  and the Assyrian has oppressed
        them without cause.
052:005 Now therefore, what do I here, says Yahweh, seeing that my people
        is taken away for nothing? those who rule over them do howl,
        says Yahweh, and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.
052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name:  therefore [they shall
        know] in that day that I am he who does speak; behold, it is I.
052:007 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings
        good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good,
        who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns!
052:008 The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice,
        together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye,
        when Yahweh returns to Zion.
052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;
        for Yahweh has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
052:010 Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
        and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation
        of our God.
052:011 Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing;
        go you out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves,
        you who bear the vessels of Yahweh.
052:012 For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight:
        for Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will
        be your rearward.
052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted
        and lifted up, and shall be very high.
052:014 Like as many were astonished at you (his visage was so marred
        more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),
052:015 so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths
        at him:  for that which had not been told them shall they see;
        and that which they had not heard shall they understand.
053:001 Who has believed our message?  To whom has the arm of
        Yahweh been revealed?
053:002 For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root
        out of dry ground.  He has no form nor comeliness.
        When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
053:003 He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering,
        and acquainted with disease.  He was despised as one from whom
        men hide their face; and we didn't respect him.
053:004 Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering;
        yet we considered him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted.
053:005 But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed
        for our iniquities.  The punishment that brought our peace
        was on him; and by his wounds we are healed.
053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray.  Everyone has turned to his
        own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
053:007 He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth.
        As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that
        before its shearers is mute, so he didn't open his mouth.
053:008 He was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for
        his generation, who considered that he was cut off out
        of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience
        of my people?
053:009 They made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man
        in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was
        any deceit in his mouth.
053:010 Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.  He has caused him to suffer.
        When you make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed.
        He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh shall
        prosper in his hand.
053:011 After the suffering of his soul, he will see the
        light{So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint.
        Masoretic Text omits "the light".} and be satisfied.
        My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;
        and he will bear their iniquities.
053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,
        and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured
        out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;
        yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession
        for the transgressors.
054:001 Sing, barren, you who didn't bear; break forth into singing,
        and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child:
        for more are the children of the desolate than the children
        of the married wife, says Yahweh.
054:002 Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch
        forth the curtains of your habitations; don't spare:
        lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
054:003 For you shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left;
        and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate
        cities to be inhabited.
054:004 Don't be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed:
        neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed:
        for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach
        of your widowhood shall you remember no more.
054:005 For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name:
        and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole
        earth shall he be called.
054:006 For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved
        in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,
        says your God.
054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies
        will I gather you.
054:008 In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment;
        but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you,
        says Yahweh your Redeemer.
054:009 For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn
        that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth,
        so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you,
        nor rebuke you.
054:010 For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed;
        but my loving kindness shall not depart from you,
        neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, says Yahweh
        who has mercy on you.
054:011 You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold,
        I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your
        foundations with sapphires.
054:012 I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of
        sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
054:013 All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall
        be the peace of your children.
054:014 In righteousness shall you be established:  you shall be far
        from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror,
        for it shall not come near you.
054:015 Behold, they may gather together, but not by me:  whoever shall
        gather together against you shall fall because of you.
054:016 Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals,
        and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created
        the waster to destroy.
054:017 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every
        tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn.
        This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh, and their
        righteousness which is of me, says Yahweh.
055:001 Ho, everyone who thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has
        no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk
        without money and without price.
055:002 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your
        labor for that which doesn't satisfy? listen diligently to me,
        and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight
        itself in fatness.
055:003 Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live:
        and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure
        mercies of David.
055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,
        a leader and commander to the peoples.
055:005 Behold, you shall call a nation that you don't know;
        and a nation that didn't know you shall run to you,
        because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel;
        for he has glorified you.
055:006 Seek you Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while
        he is near:
055:007 let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
        and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him;
        and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
        my ways, says Yahweh.
055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
        higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
055:010 For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,
        and doesn't return there, but waters the earth, and makes it
        bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread
        to the eater;
055:011 so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth:
        it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish
        that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing I sent
        it to do.
055:012 For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:
        the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you
        into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall
        clap their hands.
055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree;
        and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:
        and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign
        that shall not be cut off.
056:001 Thus says Yahweh, Keep you justice, and do righteousness;
        for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness
        to be revealed.
056:002 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds
        it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps
        his hand from doing any evil.
056:003 Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to Yahweh,
        speak, saying, Yahweh will surely separate me from his people;
        neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
056:004 For thus says Yahweh of the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
        and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:
056:005 To them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial
        and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give
        them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
056:006 Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister
        to him, and to love the name of Yahweh, to be his servants,
        everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds
        fast my covenant;
056:007 even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
        joyful in my house of prayer:  their burnt offerings and their
        sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall
        be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
056:008 The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet will
        I gather [others] to him, besides his own who are gathered.
056:009 All you animals of the field, come to devour, [yes], all you
        animals in the forest.
056:010 His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge;
        they are all mute dogs, they can't bark; dreaming, lying down,
        loving to slumber.
056:011 Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough;
        and these are shepherds who can't understand:
        they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain,
        from every quarter.
056:012 Come you, [say they], I will get wine, and we will fill
        ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,
        [a day] great beyond measure.
057:001 The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful
        men are taken away, none considering that the righteous
        is taken away from the evil [to come].
057:002 He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks
        in his uprightness.
057:003 But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed
        of the adulterer and the prostitute.
057:004 Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you
        a wide mouth, and put out the tongue?  Aren't you children
        of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,
057:005 you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree;
        who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts
        of the rocks?
057:006 Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion;
        they, they are your lot; even to them have you poured
        a drink offering, you have offered an offering.
        Shall I be appeased for these things?
057:007 On a high and lofty mountain have you set your bed;
        there also you went up to offer sacrifice.
057:008 Behind the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial:
        for you have uncovered [yourself] to another than me,
        and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you
        a covenant with them:  you loved their bed where you saw it.
057:009 You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes,
        and did send your ambassadors far off, and did debase yourself
        even to Sheol.
057:010 You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn't say,
        It is in vain:  you found a reviving of your strength;
        therefore you weren't faint.
057:011 Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie,
        and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart?
        Haven't I held my peace even of long time, and you don't fear me?
057:012 I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works,
        they shall not profit you.
057:013 When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you;
        but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away:
        but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land,
        and shall inherit my holy mountain.
057:014 He will say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up
        the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
057:015 For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,
        whose name is Holy:  I dwell in the high and holy place,
        with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
        to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart
        of the contrite.
057:016 For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry;
        for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who
        I have made.
057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him;
        I hid [my face] and was angry; and he went on backsliding
        in the way of his heart.
057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him:  I will lead him also,
        and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
057:019 I create the fruit of the lips:  Peace, peace, to him who is far
        off and to him who is near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.
057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can't rest,
        and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
057:021 There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.
058:001 Cry aloud, don't spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet,
        and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house
        of Jacob their sins.
058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways:
        as a nation that did righteousness, and didn't forsake
        the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments;
        they delight to draw near to God.
058:003 Why have we fasted, [say they], and you don't see? [why]
        have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?
        Behold, in the day of your fast you find [your own] pleasure,
        and exact all your labors.
058:004 Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike
        with the fist of wickedness:  you don't fast this day so as
        to make your voice to be heard on high.
058:005 Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man
        to afflict his soul?  Is it to bow down his head as a rush,
        and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call
        this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?
058:006 Isn't this the fast that I have chosen:  to loose the bonds
        of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let
        the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?
058:007 Isn't it to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring
        the poor who are cast out to your house? when you see the naked,
        that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from
        your own flesh?
058:008 Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your healing
        shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go
        before you; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard.
058:009 Then shall you call, and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry,
        and he will say, Here I am.  If you take away from
        the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger,
        and speaking wickedly;
058:010 and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy
        the afflicted soul:  then shall your light rise in darkness,
        and your obscurity be as the noonday;
058:011 and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul
        in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall
        be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,
        whose waters don't fail.
058:012 Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places;
        you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;
        and you shall be called The repairer of the breach,
        The restorer of paths to dwell in.
058:013 If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your
        pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight,
        [and] the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it,
        not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure,
        nor speaking [your own] words:
058:014 then shall you delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will
        make you to ride on the high places of the earth;
        and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:
        for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.
059:001 Behold, Yahweh's hand is not shortened, that it can't save;
        neither his ear heavy, that it can't hear:
059:002 but your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
        and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he
        will not hear.
059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;
        your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.
059:004 None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth:
        they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief,
        and bring forth iniquity.
059:005 They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web:
        he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed
        breaks out into a viper.
059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
        themselves with their works:  their works are works of iniquity,
        and the act of violence is in their hands.
059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:
        their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and
        destruction are in their paths.
059:008 The way of peace they don't know; and there is no justice
        in their goings:  they have made them crooked paths;
        whoever goes therein does not know peace.
059:009 Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness
        overtake us:  we look for light, but, behold, darkness;
        for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those
        who have no eyes:  we stumble at noonday as in the twilight;
        among those who are lusty we are as dead men.
059:011 We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves:
        we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation,
        but it is far off from us.
059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins
        testify against us; for our transgressions are with us,
        and as for our iniquities, we know them:
059:013 transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following
        our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering
        from the heart words of falsehood.
059:014 Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off;
        for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can't enter.
059:015 Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself
        a prey.  Yahweh saw it, and it displeased him that there
        was no justice.
059:016 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
        no intercessor:  therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;
        and his righteousness, it upheld him.
059:017 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation
        on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
        and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,
        wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies;
        to the islands he will repay recompense.
059:019 So shall they fear the name of Yahweh from the west,
        and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come
        as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.
059:020 A Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from
        disobedience in Jacob, says Yahweh.
059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh:
        my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth,
        shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth
        of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed,
        says Yahweh, from henceforth and forever.
060:001 Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of Yahweh
        is risen on you.
060:002 For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
        the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you, and his glory
        shall be seen on you.
060:003 Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness
        of your rising.
060:004 Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  they all gather
        themselves together, they come to you; your sons shall come
        from far, and your daughters shall be carried in the arms.
060:005 Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill
        and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be
        turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries
        of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come;
        they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim
        the praises of Yahweh.
060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you,
        the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come
        up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house
        of my glory.
060:008 Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
060:009 Surely the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of
        Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver
        and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God,
        and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.
060:010 Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall
        minister to you:  for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor
        have I had mercy on you.
060:011 Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be
        shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth
        of the nations, and their kings led captive.
060:012 For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish;
        yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine,
        and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary;
        and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
060:014 The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you;
        and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at
        the soles of your feet; and they shall call you The city
        of Yahweh, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
060:015 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man
        passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency,
        a joy of many generations.
060:016 You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast
        of kings; and you shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,
        and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
        and for wood brass, and for stones iron.  I will also make
        your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler.
060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, desolation nor
        destruction within your borders; but you shall call your
        walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
060:019 The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness
        shall the moon give light to you:  but Yahweh will be to you
        an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
060:020 Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon
        withdraw itself; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light,
        and the days of your mourning shall be ended.
060:021 Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit
        the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,
        that I may be glorified.
060:022 The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one
        a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will hasten it in its time.
061:001 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed
        me to preach good news to the humble; he has sent me to bind
        up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
        and the opening [of the prison] to those who are bound;
061:002 to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance
        of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
061:003 to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them
        a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment
        of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be
        called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh,
        that he may be glorified.
061:004 They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
        former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
        the desolations of many generations.
061:005 Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners
        shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
061:006 But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh; men shall call
        you the ministers of our God:  you shall eat the wealth
        of the nations, and in their glory shall you boast yourselves.
061:007 Instead of your shame [you shall have] double; and instead
        of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion:
        therefore in their land they shall possess double;
        everlasting joy shall be to them.
061:008 For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity;
        and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will
        make an everlasting covenant with them.
061:009 Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring
        among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them,
        that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.
061:010 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
        for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has
        covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom
        decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself
        with her jewels.
061:011 For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden
        causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth;
        so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise
        to spring forth before all the nations.
062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake
        I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness,
        and her salvation as a lamp that burns.
062:002 The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory,
        and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth
        of Yahweh shall name.
062:003 You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh,
        and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
062:004 You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land
        any more be termed Desolate:  but you shall be called Hephzibah,
        and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your
        land shall be married.
062:005 For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you;
        and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall
        your God rejoice over you.
062:006 I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall
        never hold their peace day nor night:  you who call on Yahweh,
        take no rest,
062:007 and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes
        Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
062:008 Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
        Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies;
        and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which
        you have labored:
062:009 but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh;
        and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts
        of my sanctuary.
062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people;
        cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
        lift up a banner for the peoples.
062:011 Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth,
        Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes;
        behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
062:012 They shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh:
        and you shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
063:001 Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from
        Bozrah? this who is glorious in his clothing, marching in
        the greatness of his strength?  I who speak in righteousness,
        mighty to save.
063:002 Why are you red in your clothing, and your garments like him
        who treads in the wine vat?
063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was
        no man with me:  yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them
        in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,
        and I have stained all my clothing.
063:004 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my
        redeemed is come.
063:005 I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there
        was none to uphold:  therefore my own arm brought salvation to me;
        and my wrath, it upheld me.
063:006 I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk
        in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.
063:007 I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh,
        [and] the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has
        bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
        which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies,
        and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
063:008 For he said, Surely, they are my people, children who will
        not deal falsely:  so he was their Savior.
063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
        presence saved them:  in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;
        and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
063:010 But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit:
        therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself
        fought against them.
063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people,
        [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea
        with the shepherds of his flock? where is he who put his holy
        Spirit in the midst of them?
063:012 who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses?
        who divided the waters before them, to make himself
        an everlasting name?
063:013 who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness,
        so that they didn't stumble?
063:014 As the livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit
        of Yahweh caused them to rest; so did you lead your people,
        to make yourself a glorious name.
063:015 Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your
        holiness and of your glory:  where are your zeal and your
        mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassion
        is restrained toward me.
063:016 For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn't know us,
        and Israel does not acknowledge us:  you, Yahweh, are our Father;
        our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
063:017 O Yahweh, why do you make us to err from your ways,
        and harden our heart from your fear?  Return for your servants'
        sake, the tribes of your inheritance.
063:018 Your holy people possessed [it] but a little while:
        our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
063:019 We are become as they over whom you never bear rule,
        as those who were not called by your name.
064:001 Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down,
        that the mountains might quake at your presence,
064:002 as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes
        the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries,
        that the nations may tremble at your presence!
064:003 When you did terrible things which we didn't look for,
        you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
064:004 For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
        neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him
        who waits for him.
064:005 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember
        you in your ways:  behold, you were angry, and we sinned:
        in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved?
064:006 For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our
        righteousness is as a polluted garment:  and we all fade as a leaf;
        and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
064:007 There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself
        to take hold of you; for you have hid your face from us,
        and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
064:008 But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you
        our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
064:009 Don't be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever:
        see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.
064:010 Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become
        a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you,
        is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
064:012 Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? will you
        hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?
065:001 I am inquired of by those who didn't ask; I am found by those
        who didn't seek me:  I said, See me, see me, to a nation
        that was not called by my name.
065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people,
        who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
065:003 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing
        in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;
065:004 who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places;
        who eat pig's flesh, and broth of abominable things is
        in their vessels;
065:005 who say, Stand by yourself, don't come near to me,
        for I am holier than you.  These are a smoke in my nose,
        a fire that burns all the day.
065:006 Behold, it is written before me:  I will not keep silence,
        but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,
065:007 your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
        says Yahweh, who have burned incense on the mountains,
        and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure
        their work into their bosom.
065:008 Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
        and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is in it:
        so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not
        destroy them all.
065:009 I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah
        an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it,
        and my servants shall dwell there.
065:010 Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place
        for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.
065:011 But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain,
        who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed
        wine to Destiny;
065:012 I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down
        to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer;
        when I spoke, you did not hear; but you did that which was
        evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn't delight.
065:013 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, my servants shall eat,
        but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink,
        but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice,
        but you shall be disappointed;
065:014 behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall
        cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
065:015 You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen;
        and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants
        by another name:
065:016 so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself
        in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear
        by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten,
        and because they are hid from my eyes.
065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former
        things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
065:018 But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
        for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
065:019 I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people;
        and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping
        and the voice of crying.
065:020 There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old
        man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die
        one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years
        old shall be accursed.
065:021 They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
        plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
        and another eat:  for as the days of a tree shall be the days
        of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work
        of their hands.
065:023 They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity;
        for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their
        offspring with them.
065:024 It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer;
        and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
        eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food.
        They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
        says Yahweh.
066:001 Thus says Yahweh, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool:
        what manner of house will you build to me? and what place
        shall be my rest?
066:002 For all these things has my hand made, and [so] all these things
        came to be, says Yahweh:  but to this man will I look,
        even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who
        trembles at my word.
066:003 He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices
        a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering,
        [as he who offers] pig's blood; he who burns frankincense,
        as he who blesses an idol.  Yes, they have chosen their own ways,
        and their soul delights in their abominations:
066:004 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
        on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke,
        they did not hear:  but they did that which was evil in my eyes,
        and chose that in which I didn't delight.
066:005 Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word:
        Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake,
        have said, Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your joy;
        but it is those who shall be disappointed.
066:006 A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple,
        a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies.
066:007 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
        she was delivered of a boy.
066:008 Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things?
        Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought
        forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought
        forth her children.
066:009 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
        says Yahweh:  shall I who cause to bring forth shut [the
        womb]? says your God.
066:010 Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who
        love her:  rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;
066:011 that you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of
        her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted
        with the abundance of her glory.
066:012 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,
        and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream:
        and you shall suck [of it]; you shall be borne on the side,
        and shall be dandled on the knees.
066:013 As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you;
        and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
066:014 You shall see [it], and your heart shall rejoice,
        and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass:
        and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants;
        and he will have indignation against his enemies.
066:015 For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots shall
        be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness,
        and his rebuke with flames of fire.
066:016 For by fire will Yahweh execute judgment, and by his sword,
        on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many.
066:017 Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go]
        to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating pig's flesh,
        and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an
        end together, says Yahweh.
066:018 For I [know] their works and their thoughts:  [the time] comes,
        that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come,
        and shall see my glory.
066:019 I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape
        of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw
        the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the islands afar off,
        who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory;
        and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
066:020 They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an
        offering to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters,
        and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,
        says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering
        in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.
066:021 Of them also will I take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.
066:022 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
        shall remain before me, says Yahweh, so shall your seed
        and your name remain.
066:023 It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from
        one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship
        before me, says Yahweh.
066:024 They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men
        who have transgressed against me:  for their worm shall not die,
        neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be
        an abhorring to all flesh.
Book 24 Jeremiah
001:001 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
        who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
001:002 to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son
        of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
001:003 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
        king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah,
        the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away
        of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
001:004 Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
001:005 Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, and before you
        came forth out of the womb I sanctified you; I have appointed
        you a prophet to the nations.
001:006 Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, I don't know how to speak;
        for I am a child.
001:007 But Yahweh said to me, Don't say, I am a child; for to whoever I
        shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you,
        you shall speak.
001:008 Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to
        deliver you, says Yahweh.
001:009 Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh
        said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth:
001:010 behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over
        the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy
        and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
001:011 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremiah,
        what see you?  I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
001:012 Then said Yahweh to me, You have well seen:  for I watch
        over my word to perform it.
001:013 The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, What see you?
        I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face of it is
        from the north.
001:014 Then Yahweh said to me, Out of the north evil shall break
        forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
001:015 For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms
        of the north, says Yahweh; and they shall come, and they
        shall set everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates
        of Jerusalem, and against all the walls of it round about,
        and against all the cities of Judah.
001:016 I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness,
        in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense
        to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
001:017 You therefore gird up your waist, and arise, and speak
        to them all that I command you:  don't be dismayed at them,
        lest I dismay you before them.
001:018 For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city,
        and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land,
        against the kings of Judah, against the princes of it,
        against the priests of it, and against the people of the land.
001:019 They shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you:
        for I am with you, says Yahweh, to deliver you.
002:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
002:002 Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says
        Yahweh, I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love
        of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness,
        in a land that was not sown.
002:003 Israel [was] holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase:
        all who devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come
        on them, says Yahweh.
002:004 Hear you the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families
        of the house of Israel:
002:005 thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
        that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity,
        and are become vain?
002:006 Neither said they, Where is Yahweh who brought us up out
        of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness,
        through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of
        drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none
        passed through, and where no man lived?
002:007 I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and
        the goodness of it; but when you entered, you defiled my land,
        and made my heritage an abomination.
002:008 The priests didn't say, Where is Yahweh? and those who handle
        the law didn't know me:  the rulers also transgressed against me,
        and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things
        that do not profit.
002:009 Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Yahweh, and with
        your children's children will I contend.
002:010 For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send
        to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been
        such a thing.
002:011 Has a nation changed [its] gods, which yet are no gods? but my
        people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
002:012 Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
        be you very desolate, says Yahweh.
002:013 For my people have committed two evils:  they have forsaken me,
        the spring of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns,
        broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
002:014 Is Israel a servant? is he a native-born [slave]? why is
        he become a prey?
002:015 The young lions have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made
        his land waste:  his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
002:016 The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown
        of your head.
002:017 Haven't you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken
        Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?
002:018 Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters
        of the Shihor? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria,
        to drink the waters of the River?
002:019 Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding
        shall reprove you:  know therefore and see that it is an evil
        thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,
        and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
002:020 For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds;
        and you said, I will not serve; for on every high hill and under
        every green tree you did bow yourself, playing the prostitute.
002:021 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed:
        how then are you turned into the degenerate branches of a
        foreign vine to me?
002:022 For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap,
        yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord Yahweh.
002:023 How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after
        the Baals? see your way in the valley, know what you have done:
        [you are] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
002:024 a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind
        in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all
        those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month
        they shall find her.
002:025 Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst:
        but you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers,
        and after them will I go.
002:026 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house
        of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes,
        and their priests, and their prophets;
002:027 who tell a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have
        brought me forth:  for they have turned their back to me,
        and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they
        will say, Arise, and save us.
002:028 But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise,
        if they can save you in the time of your trouble:
        for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.
002:029 Why will you contend with me? you all have transgressed
        against me, says Yahweh.
002:030 In vain have I struck your children; they received no correction:
        your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
002:031 Generation, see the word of Yahweh.  Have I been a wilderness
        to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? why say my people,
        We are broken loose; we will come no more to you?
002:032 Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet
        my people have forgotten me days without number.
002:033 How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked
        women have you taught your ways.
002:034 Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls
        of the innocent poor:  you did not find them breaking in;
        but it is because of all these things.
002:035 Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away
        from me.  Behold, I will enter into judgment with you,
        because you say, I have not sinned.
002:036 Why go you about so much to change your way? you shall be
        ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
002:037 From there also shall you go forth, with your hands on your head:
        for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you
        shall not prosper with them.
003:001 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
        and become another man's, will he return to her again?
        Won't that land be greatly polluted?  But you have played
        the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again
        to me, says Yahweh.
003:002 Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have
        you not been lain with?  By the ways have you sat for them,
        as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land
        with your prostitution and with your wickedness.
003:003 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has
        been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead,
        you refused to be ashamed.
003:004 Will you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are
        the guide of my youth?
003:005 Will he retain [his anger] forever? will he keep it to the end?
        Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have
        had your way.
003:006 Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king,
        Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she
        is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree,
        and there has played the prostitute.
003:007 I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me;
        but she didn't return:  and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
003:008 I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had
        committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill
        of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, didn't fear;
        but she also went and played the prostitute.
003:009 It happened through the lightness of her prostitution,
        that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery
        with stones and with stocks.
003:010 Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned
        to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense, says Yahweh.
003:011 Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more
        righteous than treacherous Judah.
003:012 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,
        Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I will not look
        in anger on you; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not
        keep [anger] forever.
003:013 Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed
        against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to
        the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed
        my voice, says Yahweh.
003:014 Return, backsliding children, says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you:
        and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family,
        and I will bring you to Zion:
003:015 and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall
        feed you with knowledge and understanding.
003:016 It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased
        in the land, in those days, says Yahweh, they shall say no more,
        The ark of the covenant of Yahweh; neither shall it come to mind;
        neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it;
        neither shall it be made any more.
003:017 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh;
        and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name
        of Yahweh, to Jerusalem:  neither shall they walk any more
        after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
003:018 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house
        of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land
        of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance
        to your fathers.
003:019 But I said, How I will put you among the children, and give
        you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies
        of the nations! and I said, You shall call me My Father,
        and shall not turn away from following me.
003:020 Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have
        you dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel, says Yahweh.
003:021 A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping [and]
        the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have
        perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.
003:022 Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding.
        Behold, we are come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.
003:023 Truly in vain is [the help that is looked for] from the hills,
        the tumult on the mountains:  truly in Yahweh our God is
        the salvation of Israel.
003:024 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers
        from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons
        and their daughters.
003:025 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us;
        for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers,
        from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed
        the voice of Yahweh our God.
004:001 If you will return, Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me,
        and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight;
        then you shall not be removed;
004:002 and you shall swear, As Yahweh lives, in truth, in justice,
        and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves
        in him, and in him shall they glory.
004:003 For thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up
        your fallow ground, and don't sow among thorns.
004:004 Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins
        of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
        lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can
        quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
004:005 Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say,
        Blow you the trumpet in the land:  cry aloud and say,
        Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
004:006 Set up a standard toward Zion:  flee for safety, don't stay;
        for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
004:007 A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations;
        he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your
        land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
004:008 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail;
        for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn't turned back from us.
004:009 It shall happen at that day, says Yahweh, that the heart
        of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes;
        and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
004:010 Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! surely you have greatly deceived
        this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace;
        whereas the sword reaches to the life.
004:011 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot
        wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter
        of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;
004:012 a full wind from these shall come for me:  now will I also utter
        judgments against them.
004:013 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall
        be] as the whirlwind:  his horses are swifter than eagles.
        Woe to us! for we are ruined.
004:014 Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved.
        How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?
004:015 For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from
        the hills of Ephraim:
004:016 make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,
        [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their
        voice against the cities of Judah.
004:017 As keepers of a field are they against her round about,
        because she has been rebellious against me, says Yahweh.
004:018 Your way and your doings have procured these things to you;
        this is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches
        to your heart.
004:019 My anguish, my anguish!  I am pained at my very heart;
        my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace;
        because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,
        the alarm of war.
004:020 Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is
        laid waste:  suddenly are my tents destroyed, [and] my curtains
        in a moment.
004:021 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound
        of the trumpet?
004:022 For my people are foolish, they don't know me; they are
        foolish children, and they have no understanding; they are
        wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
004:023 I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void;
        and the heavens, and they had no light.
004:024 I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills
        moved back and forth.
004:025 I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds
        of the sky were fled.
004:026 I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all
        the cities of it were broken down at the presence of Yahweh,
        [and] before his fierce anger.
004:027 For thus says Yahweh, The whole land shall be a desolation;
        yet will I not make a full end.
004:028 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
        because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have
        not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
004:029 Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers;
        they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks:
        every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.
004:030 You, when you are made desolate, what will you do?
        Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck you
        with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint,
        in vain do you make yourself beautiful; [your] lovers despise you,
        they seek your life.
004:031 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
        the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child,
        the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath,
        who spreads her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! for my soul
        faints before the murderers.
005:001 Run you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem,
        and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it,
        if you can find a man, if there are any who does justly,
        who seeks truth; and I will pardon her.
005:002 Though they say, As Yahweh lives; surely they swear falsely.
005:003 O Yahweh, don't your eyes look on truth? you have stricken them,
        but they were not grieved; you have consumed them, but they
        have refused to receive correction:  they have made their faces
        harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
005:004 Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they
        don't know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God:
005:005 I will get me to the great men, and will speak to them;
        for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God.
        But these with one accord have broken the yoke,
        and burst the bonds.
005:006 Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf
        of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch
        against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall
        be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many,
        [and] their backsliding is increased.
005:007 How can I pardon you? your children have forsaken me, and sworn
        by them that are no gods:  when I had fed them to the full,
        they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops
        at the prostitutes' houses.
005:008 They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed
        after his neighbor's wife.
005:009 Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; and shall
        not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
005:010 Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don't make a full end:
        take away her branches; for they are not Yahweh's.
005:011 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt
        very treacherously against me, says Yahweh.
005:012 They have denied Yahweh, and said, It is not he; neither shall
        evil come on us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
005:013 and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them:
        thus shall it be done to them.
005:014 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, Because you speak
        this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire,
        and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
005:015 Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Israel,
        says Yahweh:  it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation,
        a nation whose language you don't know, neither understand
        what they say.
005:016 Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men.
005:017 They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, [which] your sons
        and your daughters should eat; they shall eat up your flocks
        and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees;
        they shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust,
        with the sword.
005:018 But even in those days, says Yahweh, I will not make a full
        end with you.
005:019 It shall happen, when you shall say, Why has Yahweh our God
        done all these things to us? then shall you say to them,
        Like as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land,
        so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
005:020 Declare you this in the house of Jacob, and publish it
        in Judah, saying,
005:021 Hear now this, foolish people, and without understanding;
        who have eyes, and don't see; who have ears, and don't hear:
005:022 Don't you fear me? says Yahweh:  won't you tremble at my presence,
        who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea,
        by a perpetual decree, that it can't pass it? and though
        the waves of it toss themselves, yet they can't prevail;
        though they roar, yet they can't pass over it.
005:023 But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart;
        they are revolted and gone.
005:024 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Yahweh our God,
        who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season;
        who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
005:025 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins
        have withheld good from you.
005:026 For among my people are found wicked men:  they watch,
        as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.
005:027 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
        therefore they are become great, and grew rich.
005:028 They are grew fat, they shine:  yes, they overpass in deeds
        of wickedness; they don't plead the cause, the cause
        of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right
        of the needy they don't judge.
005:029 Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my
        soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
005:030 A wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land:
005:031 the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule
        by their means; and my people love to have it so:
        and what will you do in the end of it?
006:001 Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst
        of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up
        a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north,
        and a great destruction.
006:002 The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
006:003 Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall
        pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed
        everyone in his place.
006:004 Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
        Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening
        are stretched out.
006:005 Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
006:006 For thus has Yahweh of Armies said, Hew you down trees, and cast
        up a mound against Jerusalem:  this is the city to be visited;
        she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
006:007 As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness:
        violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually
        is sickness and wounds.
006:008 Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you;
        lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.
006:009 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, They shall thoroughly glean
        the remnant of Israel as a vine:  turn again your hand
        as a grape gatherer into the baskets.
006:010 To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold,
        their ear is uncircumcised, and they can't listen:
        behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach;
        they have no delight in it.
006:011 Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary
        with holding in:  pour it out on the children in the street,
        and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband
        with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is
        full of days.
006:012 Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their
        wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants
        of the land, says Yahweh.
006:013 For from the least of them even to the greatest of them
        everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet
        even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
006:014 They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly,
        saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
006:015 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
        they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
        therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time
        that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
006:016 Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask
        for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein,
        and you shall find rest for your souls:  but they said,
        We will not walk [therein].
006:017 I set watchmen over you, [saying], Listen to the sound of the trumpet;
        but they said, We will not listen.
006:018 Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation,
        what is among them.
006:019 Hear, earth:  behold, I will bring evil on this people,
        even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened
        to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
006:020 To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba,
        and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings
        are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
006:021 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks
        before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall
        stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
006:022 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a people comes from the north country;
        and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost
        parts of the earth.
006:023 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy;
        their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses,
        everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you,
        daughter of Zion.
006:024 We have heard the report of it; our hands wax feeble:
        anguish has taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.
006:025 Don't go forth into the field, nor walk by the way;
        for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.
006:026 Daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow
        yourself in ashes:  make you mourning, as for an only son,
        most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly
        come on us.
006:027 I have made you a tester of metals [and] a fortress among my people;
        that you may know and try their way.
006:028 They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders;
        they are brass and iron:  they all of them deal corruptly.
006:029 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire:
        in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are
        not plucked away.
006:030 Refuse silver shall men them, because Yahweh has rejected them.
007:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
007:002 Stand in the gate of Yahweh's house, and proclaim there
        this word, and say, Hear the word of Yahweh, all you of Judah,
        who enter in at these gates to worship Yahweh.
007:003 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
        and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
007:004 Don't you trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Yahweh,
        the temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, are these.
007:005 For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings;
        if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
007:006 if you don't oppress the foreigner, the fatherless,
        and the widow, and don't shed innocent blood in this place,
        neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:
007:007 then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
        that I gave to your fathers, from of old even forevermore.
007:008 Behold, you trust in lying words, that can't profit.
007:009 Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
        and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you
        have not known,
007:010 and come and stand before me in this house, which is called
        by my name, and say, We are delivered; that you may do
        all these abominations?
007:011 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers
        in your eyes?  Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Yahweh.
007:012 But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused
        my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it
        for the wickedness of my people Israel.
007:013 Now, because you have done all these works, says Yahweh, and I
        spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you didn't hear;
        and I called you, but you didn't answer:
007:014 therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name,
        in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you
        and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
007:015 I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
        your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
007:016 Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up
        a cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me;
        for I will not hear you.
007:017 Don't you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in
        the streets of Jerusalem?
007:018 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,
        and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen
        of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods,
        that they may provoke me to anger.
007:019 Do they provoke me to anger? says Yahweh; [do they] not
        [provoke] themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
007:020 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, my anger and my
        wrath shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on animal,
        and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground;
        and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
007:021 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Add your burnt
        offerings to your sacrifices, and eat meat.
007:022 For I didn't speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day
        that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt
        offerings or sacrifices:
007:023 but this thing I commanded them, saying, Listen to my voice,
        and I will be your God, and you shall be my people;
        and walk you in all the way that I command you, that it may
        be well with you.
007:024 But they didn't listen nor turn their ear, but walked in [their
        own] counsels [and] in the stubbornness of their evil heart,
        and went backward, and not forward.
007:025 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
        to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets,
        daily rising up early and sending them:
007:026 yet they didn't listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made
        their neck stiff:  they did worse than their fathers.
007:027 You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not
        listen to you:  you shall also call to them; but they will
        not answer you.
007:028 You shall tell them, This is the nation that has not listened
        to the voice of Yahweh their God, nor received instruction:
        truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
007:029 Cut off your hair, [Jerusalem], and cast it away, and take up
        a lamentation on the bare heights; for Yahweh has rejected
        and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
007:030 For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,
        says Yahweh:  they have set their abominations in the house
        which is called by my name, to defile it.
007:031 They have built the high places of Topheth, which is
        in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons
        and their daughters in the fire; which I didn't command,
        nor did it come into my mind.
007:032 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall
        no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom,
        but The valley of Slaughter:  for they shall bury in Topheth,
        until there be no place [to bury].
007:033 The dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds
        of the sky, and for the animals of the earth; and none shall
        frighten them away.
007:034 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from
        the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice
        of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride;
        for the land shall become a waste.
008:001 At that time, says Yahweh, they shall bring out the bones
        of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes,
        and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets,
        and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
008:002 and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon,
        and all the army of the sky, which they have loved,
        and which they have served, and after which they have walked,
        and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped:
        they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be
        for dung on the surface of the earth.
008:003 Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
        that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places
        where I have driven them, says Yahweh of Armies.
008:004 Moreover you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh:  Shall men fall,
        and not rise up again?  Shall one turn away, and not return?
008:005 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual
        backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
008:006 I listened and heard, but they didn't speak aright:
        no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, What have I
        done? everyone turns to his course, as a horse that rushes
        headlong in the battle.
008:007 Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times;
        and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time
        of their coming; but my people don't know Yahweh's law.
008:008 How do you say, We are wise, and the law of Yahweh is with us?
        But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely.
008:009 The wise men are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken:
        behold, they have rejected the word of Yahweh; and what manner
        of wisdom is in them?
008:010 Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their
        fields to those who shall possess them:  for everyone from
        the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness;
        from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.
008:011 They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
        saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
008:012 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
        they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
        therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time
        of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
008:013 I will utterly consume them, says Yahweh:  there shall be no
        grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
        shall fade; and [the things that] I have given them shall
        pass away from them.
008:014 Why do we sit still?  Assemble yourselves, and let us enter
        into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there;
        for Yahweh our God has put us to silence, and given us water
        of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Yahweh.
008:015 We looked for peace, but no good came; [and] for a time of healing,
        and behold, dismay!
008:016 The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan:  at the sound
        of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles;
        for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it;
        the city and those who dwell therein.
008:017 For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will
        not be charmed; and they shall bite you, says Yahweh.
008:018 Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow!  My heart
        is faint within me.
008:019 Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land
        that is very far off:  isn't Yahweh in Zion?  Isn't her King in her?
        Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images,
        and with foreign vanities?
008:020 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
008:021 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt:
        I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.
008:022 Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why
        then isn't the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
009:001 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears,
        that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter
        of my people!
009:002 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men;
        that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they
        are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
009:003 They bend their tongue, [as it were] their bow, for falsehood;
        and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth:
        for they proceed from evil to evil, and they don't
        know me, says Yahweh.
009:004 Take you heed everyone of his neighbor, and don't you trust
        in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant,
        and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
009:005 They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak
        the truth:  they have taught their tongue to speak lies;
        they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
009:006 Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
        refuse to know me, says Yahweh.
009:007 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will melt them,
        and try them; for how [else] should I do, because of the daughter
        of my people?
009:008 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit:
        one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth,
        but in his heart he lays wait for him.
009:009 Shall I not visit them for these things? says Yahweh;
        shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
009:010 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing,
        and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation,
        because they are burned up, so that none passes through;
        neither can men hear the voice of the livestock; both the birds
        of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone.
009:011 I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling place of jackals; and I
        will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
009:012 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is]
        he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare
        it? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness,
        so that none passes through?
009:013 Yahweh says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set
        before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,
009:014 but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart,
        and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them;
009:015 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I
        will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give
        them water of gall to drink.
009:016 I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor
        their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them,
        until I have consumed them.
009:017 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Consider you, and call for the mourning
        women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women,
        that they may come:
009:018 and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us,
        that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush
        out with waters.
009:019 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined!
        we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land,
        because they have cast down our dwellings.
009:020 Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you women, and let your ear receive
        the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing,
        and everyone her neighbor lamentation.
009:021 For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces;
        to cut off the children from outside, [and] the young men
        from the streets.
009:022 Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung
        on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester;
        and none shall gather [them].
009:023 Thus says Yahweh, Don't let the wise man glory in his wisdom,
        neither let the mighty man glory in his might, don't let
        the rich man glory in his riches;
009:024 but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding,
        and knows me, that I am Yahweh who exercises loving
        kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth:
        for in these things I delight, says Yahweh.
009:025 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will punish all
        those who are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision:
009:026 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab,
        and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off, who dwell
        in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised,
        and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.
010:001 Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!
010:002 Thus says Yahweh, "Don't learn the way of the nations,
        and don't be dismayed at the signs of the sky; for the nations
        are dismayed at them.
010:003 For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree
        out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman
        with the axe.
010:004 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
        and with hammers, that it not move.
010:005 They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and don't speak:
        they must be carried, because they can't go.  Don't be afraid
        of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it in them
        to do good."
010:006 There is none like you, Yahweh; you are great, and your name
        is great in might.
010:007 Who should not fear you, King of the nations? for to you does
        it appertain; because among all the wise men of the nations,
        and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.
010:008 But they are together brutish and foolish:  the instruction
        of idols! it is but a stock.
010:009 There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,
        and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands
        of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing;
        they are all the work of skillful men.
010:010 But Yahweh is the true God; he is the living God,
        and an everlasting King:  at his wrath the earth trembles,
        and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
010:011 Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made
        the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth,
        and from under the heavens.
010:012 He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world
        by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched
        out the heavens:
010:013 when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
        and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
        he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind
        out of his treasuries.
010:014 Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge;
        every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;
        for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
010:015 They are vanity, a work of delusion:  in the time of their
        visitation they shall perish.
010:016 The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former
        of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance:
        Yahweh of Armies is his name.
010:017 Gather up your wares out of the land, you who abide in the siege.
010:018 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants
        of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they
        may feel [it].
010:019 Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous:
        but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.
010:020 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken:
        my children are gone forth from me, and they are no more:
        there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set
        up my curtains.
010:021 For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired
        of Yahweh:  therefore t
blue in the dark, you know. Might be one of your transport planes."

Colonel Welsh glanced at his wrist watch in the glow of the cabin
light, and shook his head.

"No," he said. "At least, npers contained names and addresses of key
men in their organization. And right now some of my agents, and F.B.I.
agents, are waiting in that shack for the so-called big boss. His
capture alone will be something mighty big. Yes, you two played a major
part today in nipping something big in the bud. So it isn't fair to ask
you to--"

"Okay, okay!" Dave suddenly snapped. "If you don't think we rate a
crack at it, then have the Indian sail without us. I'm willing to take
the chance. So's Freddy. But if you think we'd mess up things, then
skip it. Let it slide."

The Colonel blinked and gave Dave a startled look. It wasn't every day
that a junior officer flung words into his teeth, and it caught him
completely off balance.

"But it's you I'm thinking of!" he blurted out. "I--"

"Oh, quite!" Freddy snapped him off. "We understand perfectly! We
bungled it last night, Dave and I, not getting away from that beggar in
the Waco. Shouldn't let him hit the engine. Yet, we'd probably make a
worse mess of things if you sent us aboard the Indian."

"Now, that's not true!" the Colonel shouted. Then, sucking in his
breath: "You two are making me mad. You're taking it the wrong way.
I--"

"And how do you think _we_ feel?" Dave stepped right in on him. "Last
night you had a job for us to tackle. We might click on it, or we might
muff it. You didn't have a thing for us to work on. But at least we
were going to have a crack at it, and be aboard a ship that's going
into action. Well, have you any more for us to work on, now, than you
had last night? No. Not a thing more. The only difference is that the
rat aboard knows we're coming aboard. At least we think he knows. But
we're not even sure of _that_! Yet--well, holy catfish! Now you want to
call everything off because the other guy holds more cards than we do;
because we might get hurt. Look, Colonel! What do you think Freddy and
I have been doing with the enemy ever since we got into the Royal Air
Force? Playing snowball with them? We run the risk of being blacked out
for keeps. So what? Doggone it! We've seen enough of this war to know
it's no tea party."

"Exactly, and absolutely!" Freddy Farmer echoed vigorously as Dave ran
out of breath.

Colonel Welsh glared at them for a full ten seconds. Then his stern
face slowly broke into a grin, and he gave a little baffled shake of
his head.

"Wild men!" he grunted. "I don't believe either of you knows even how
to spell common sense. But maybe that's been the secret of your war
success. That, and cold courage. All right, you win. You sail with the
Indian. I'll see that you're put aboard the tender and taken out to
her. The least I can do is spare your lives as long as I can."

"You mean because of what happened to your two agents last night?" Dave
asked with a grin.

Colonel Welsh stood up and shook his head.

"No," he said. "The tender will leave in secret from a point up the
shore, and the Indian's Captain will be informed of your coming. No,
I mean sparing your lives for a while by sending you out officially.
Otherwise, you two would probably try to swim out to her and be shot in
the water by the deck watch. So I'll send you officially, and--well,
God bless both of you--and keep you in His shadow. Amen!"




CHAPTER FOURTEEN

_Invisible Walls_


Her engines turning over at close to top speed, the Aircraft Carrier
Indian sliced her bow through the sky blue waters of the Pacific on a
southwesterly course. To port and to starboard her destroyer escort
scooted and twisted about like little smoke-belching water bugs having
a field day. High in the air and several miles out in front, the
advance scouting section winged along with all eyes on the watch for
the first sign of possible enemy interference.

For eight days, now, the Indian had been racing across the vast Pacific
for her rendezvous with the cruiser squadron and other navy craft that
were to make the surprise attack on the Jap-occupied Marshall Islands.
For eight days, and eight nights, racing westward and southward toward
a well planned blow, and victory. Yet it might not be victory but
disaster and death. For eight days and eight nights Freddy Farmer and
Dave Dawson had played an active part in the life aboard that mighty
ship of eagle's wings. They had made new friends, they had thrilled to
the thunder and the power of their Douglas Devastator torpedo bomber as
they went ripping off the carrier's flight deck and up into the blue
Pacific sky for their daily practice patrol trick. They had felt once
again the tingling excitement of the alert alarm, and the hunt for
possible enemy craft in adjacent waters.

It had been eight days and nights of new things, a new routine, new
orders, new faces, almost a new language in a new world. They were
a part of what would be in not so many months to come the mightiest
fighting force in all the world's history. It was perfect, it was
tops--but it was not enough. Not enough, because with each passing
hour, each passing day, their own personal defeat drew closer and
closer. Eight days, and eight nights, and they were no nearer to
accomplishing their special mission than they had been the very first
moment they heard details of it fall from Colonel Welsh's lips way back
in Washington, D. C.

"It really is an invisible wall this time, Dave," Freddy Farmer
muttered bitterly as he and Dawson sunned themselves in the flight
deck crash nets on the starboard side. "We might as well admit it. We
haven't the faintest idea who the blighter might be. For all we know,
he's already passed on his blasted information to the Japs; tossed it
over the side at night, with a delayed flare bomb, for some trailing
Jap submarine to sight and pick up. Blast it all! For all we know, the
blighter may not be aboard at all."

"You're telling me?" Dave groaned, and rolled over on his stomach.
"For all we know he's been watching us every minute, and laughing his
darned head off. When I let fly at Colonel Welsh back there in San
Diego--and it's a wonder he didn't knock me kicking for my lip--I felt
sort of cocky. I had a hunch that we'd be sure to trip over a break.
What, I had no idea. But we've gone into things before with our heads
down, and nothing else but a prayer. And somehow we managed to barge
or stumble into something that paid off. But this? We're just a couple
of guys without a prayer. Doggone it, Freddy! I haven't even met a guy
aboard this ship I didn't like at once. And that goes for the ratings,
as well as the officers. Nuts! I guess I must have expected to see some
ugly-faced bird with dark glasses and a fake mustache sneaking around
the flight deck at night. It's got me stopped cold."

"Me too!" Freddy said with a heavy sigh. "I heard a story once of
something that happened in the last war. It was in a camp in England,
an infantry training camp. A spy was sabotaging things, causing gun
accidents, and several chaps were hurt. Well, they hunted high and low
for the lad, but no go. Then one of the chaps working on the case got
an idea. One evening when all the men were in barracks, and lights were
out, he went from barracks to barracks, popped open the door, switched
on the lights and yelled, 'Attention!' in German. In the third barracks
a chap leaped out of his bed and sprang to attention. He was the
blighter they wanted. German Army training drilled into him, you know.
He reacted to the German command automatically."

"I get it!" Dave snorted. "So we should go all over the ship yelling
'Attention!' in German? Nice, but I've got a better idea. We dress up
to look like Hitler and cover the ship. The first bird who gives us the
Nazi salute we throw to the deck and nail him down. Then we search his
quarters and find the stolen plans. It would be a cinch, but I guess
there aren't any Hitler uniforms aboard. Too bad! We'll have to think
up something else."

"Well, I certainly didn't offer it as a suggestion!" Freddy Farmer
muttered. "Frankly, the best thing we could do would be to throw
ourselves overboard. It would at least put an end to _our_ worries."

"Nope, that's out," Dave grunted. "The darn thing would still haunt me
wherever I went. And no crack, now, about _where_ I'd go! Nope! We're
stuck. Our only hope is a break, some kind of a break--any kind. Heck!
I wonder if I'd be able to recognize a break even if it stepped up and
kicked me in the face. Oh-oh! Something's going to happen, maybe!"

As Dave spoke the last he sat up and watched the young watch officer
come striding across the deck toward him. The youth was about their
age, and held an ensign's rank. He grinned as he approached and jerked
a thumb aft.

"All pilots wanted in the Ready Room, Lieutenants," he announced.
"Executive Flight Officer's orders."

"Something up?" Dave asked eagerly.

"Could be," the Ensign said with a shrug. "But maybe the flying's been
sloppy, too. You never can tell when the Exec gets in the mood to
crack down. Luck, anyway."

Dave and Freddy thanked him and went scurrying aft and down the steps
to 'tween decks and the Ready Room. The place was already half filled,
and other pilots came hurrying in after them. There was an air of eager
expectancy about the room that seemed to charge it with high voltage
electricity. The Executive Flight Officer, and the Senior Section
Leader, stood waiting on the little raised platform at the far end of
the room. Behind them hung a huge detailed chart of that section of the
Pacific west and south of the Hawaiian Islands. Colored pins dotted
its surface, and the bright light hung above it made the little pins
glitter and sparkle like so many precious stones. Five minutes after
Dave and Freddy arrived the room was packed, the doors were closed, and
a hushed silence had settled down. The Executive Flight Officer cleared
his throat, stepped to the edge of the platform, and grinned faintly.

"Don't get in too much of a sweat," he said. "This doesn't mean that
Battle Stations is going to sound in the next hour or so. However,
we're getting close to the rendezvous point, and there's some work for
us to do. In short, we're steaming into Jap waters now, more or less,
and we don't want to be caught with our wings folded. In fact, if we
are to run into unexpected action, we want to be ready to throw the
first punch, and make it count."

The senior officer paused, walked back to the map and touched a little
gold-headed pin.

"That's the Indian," he said. "That's our position right now. We're a
day's run from the cruiser squadron we are to meet, but we're plenty
near some of the Pacific islands that the Japs may be using for
submarine fuel bases. In the air, or on deck, we've got to be on our
toes every minute from now on. A torpedo or two in us now, and the
whole operation would be in danger of complete collapse. Also, we've
got to watch out for any Jap surface ships that may be on the hunt
for us. That's where you fellows come in. You've got to find any such
ships, and give them the works, before they can get the chance to spot
the Indian and her escort. In short, you fellows have got to see to it
that _nothing_ gets near the Indian from here on in."

The Executive Flight Officer paused again, and shrugged.

"Of course it's quite possible that we won't run into any trouble
at all," he said presently. "Maybe we'll just waste gas and oil
maintaining a constant patrol. That's unimportant, though. The point
is, we can't run any risks of getting snarled up in any kind of an
engagement before we make the rendezvous. So from now on every one of
you is on constant twenty-four-hour duty. The section patrols are all
plotted. Your own Section Leader will give you your chart copy each
time you take the air. Stick to the course plotted for you, and don't
worry about what the other fellow is doing. Just tend to your own
knitting. Now, here's one thing to remember every second of the time
you're away from the carrier."

The Executive Flight Officer stopped talking again, and took time out
to rake the room full of pilots with his steel grey eyes.

"Keep your radios silent all the time!" he finally said. "If you are
shot down, or forced down on the water, then it'll be just too bad for
you. Somebody else will have to pick you up. Neither the Indian nor
any of its escorting destroyers are turning back for anybody. So don't
expect help if you go down. You won't get it. The chance of meeting
enemy ships in these waters, particularly submarines, is too great to
warrant risking any rescue work. So keep your radios silent, and--well,
keep your wings up out of the wet stuff. That's all, except that
Commander Brattle, here, has rearranged the sections, and made up a
new flight board. He'll give you all the dope on the patrol schedules.
Thumbs up, to all of you!"

Half an hour later Commander Brattle had had his say and the patrol
schedules were perfectly clear to all concerned. Dave and Freddy were
to fly the Number Two plane in Section Eight. Their first patrol trick
was due in three hours. They were to fly a patrol course due north
of the steaming carrier, cover an area of several hundred square
miles, and be back on the flight deck just before darkness. It was the
toughest patrol trick of any, for the simple reason that it was the
last one before darkness set in, and flying was washed-out until early
dawn. If by any chance they got lost and were forced to spend precious
time locating the Indian, they would be out of luck. They wouldn't be
able to land after dark. And if by any chance they went down in the
water, they would first have to survive many hours of darkness floating
about on the water before they could even begin to hope for rescue.

It was a tough patrol trick to fly, but the very fact that it was tough
set Dave's heart thumping in eager expectation. Luck alone had placed
them in that section, because the section members and patrol schedules
had been arranged by drawing lots. In that way every man stood an equal
chance to get a tough assignment or an easy one. And all possibility
of favoritism went completely out the porthole. Luck, yes, but it made
Dave and Freddy feel good just the same to be handed one of the tough
patrols.

As they trooped out of the Ready Room along with the others, they
winked happily at each other, and for the moment forgot the real reason
for their presence aboard the Indian. The Executive Flight Officer had
not said much about the possibility of meeting action, but he didn't
have to. Every pilot knew that the constant patrol schedule wouldn't
have been set up if it weren't pretty certain that enemy sea and air
forces were lurking about in the immediate vicinity of the Indian and
her destroyers, if not directly in her path ahead. Come nightfall and
at least some of Uncle Sam's Navy eagles would have gone into action.

"And I sure hope it means us!" Dave echoed the thought aloud, as he and
Freddy walked forward along the flight deck. "And how, I do!"

"Do what?" Freddy asked. "What's buzzing in that brain of yours now?"

"That we see some action," Dave replied, and jerked his thumb toward
the north. "You know, Freddy, I've got a hunch. I've got a hunch, sure
as shooting."

"You usually have," the English youth sighed. "What is it this time?"

Dave stopped walking, half turned, and faced his pal.

"The break we've been hoping for, praying for," he said in a low voice
that was tight and full of excitement. "I have a hunch we're going to
get that break. Wait, now! As the Exec said, we're in enemy waters now.
From now until tomorrow night when we make the rendezvous, that unknown
skunk aboard this Carrier is going to try and make contact with the
Japs. I feel dead certain that he hasn't made any effort yet. He's been
lying doggo until the Indian got into enemy waters. Beginning with now,
though, he's going to try and make that contact."

"Well," Freddy muttered with a scowl, "as you would say, so what? How's
he going to make contact? How are we going to know it? How are we going
to be able to spot him? We haven't the faintest idea who he is, one of
the officers, or one of the men. Maybe he's just an engine wiper buried
down deep below decks. Maybe--"

"No, you're wrong there," Dave interrupted. "I've figured it out
that he is either one of the pilots, or one of the mechanics. Nobody
but pilots and mechanics have access to the flight hangar, you know.
And that's where Commander Jackson and Lieutenant Commander Pollard
were killed. No, I've figured all along that the man we're after is
connected with the actual flying end aboard ship."

"Again, so what?" Freddy grunted. "Even suppose that he's one of the
pilots? And I personally have the feeling that he is. What help is
that? We're flying in only one section, one patrol trick. He could be
in one of the other sections. He could take off, make his contact when
out of sight of the Indian, and return on schedule, and neither you nor
I be one bit the wiser."

"You're such a help!" Dave growled. "I know. Heck! Maybe I'm talking
just to make myself feel good. I don't know. Just the same, I've got a
hunch that that break is going to pop for us, and soon. A mighty strong
hunch, too."

Freddy Farmer pursed his lips, and then let a little sigh slip between
them.

"Well, I'm certainly not pulling against you," he murmured. "You have
more hunches than a stray dog has fleas. But if I ever hoped and prayed
that one of them would come true, it's certainly this one. And I mean
that from the bottom of my heart."

"Then keep praying!" Dave said grimly as an eerie chill suddenly
rippled through him. "And meantime, it might be a good idea for us to
watch our step. I've got another hunch somebody's been watching _us_!"




CHAPTER FIFTEEN

_Battle Stations_


It lacked twenty minutes to take-off time, and Dave was hurrying
through the hangar deck to go top side and report to his Section
Leader, when suddenly a groan off to his left slowed him up. He heard
the groan again, and stopped in his tracks and stared hard into the
shadows beyond some parked bombers. An instant later he saw two feet
sticking out from under a wing. He bent over and scrambled under the
wing. A man lay stretched out on the deck. His eyes were closed,
there was a blood-smeared cut on the left side of his head, and he
was groaning as he struggled weakly to force himself up to a sitting
position.

Dave cried out in sharp alarm and gave the man a helping hand. The man
was Freddy Farmer, and he was acting as though a building had just
dropped down on top of him.

"Easy, Freddy, old pal!" Dave soothed, and put his arm about his chum.
"Take it easy. Lean on me. It's Dave. Gosh! What happened, Freddy? Are
you okay?"

The sound of Dawson's voice pried open the English youth's eyes. It was
a few seconds before he could focus his eyes on Dave's face, and even
then they held a blank, befuddled look.

"I don't know," he mumbled, and gingerly touched his fingers to the cut
on his head. "Ouch! My blasted head feels in six different pieces. I
don't know what happened, Dave. Some chap bashed me, but I don't know
who. I didn't see him. I--"

Freddy paused and glanced about as though to make sure where he was.
His eyes opened wide in surprise.

"But I was way over there on the port side!" he gasped. "Just about to
go up that companion ladder to the flight deck when suddenly I got a
terrific bash on the head. I didn't hear anything, or see--Wait, Dave!
I didn't see his face, but I remember seeing his legs as I fell down.
He was wearing pilot's jumpers, so it must have been one of the pilots.
It--Good grief, Dave!"

"Check!" Dave breathed excitedly. "Our rat friend has made himself
known. This is the break, Freddy! This is the break!"

"Break, my hat!" the English youth growled, and slowly got up onto his
feet. "You call having my head practically bushed in, a break? The
beggar probably thought he'd killed me, and didn't bother to make sure.
Just dragged me over here and left me to be found a corpse."

"And what a lucky corpse you turned out to be!" Dave said with a tight
chuckle. "Hold everything, pal. Don't take things too fast. You got a
nasty crack. A clean one, though. The ship's surgeon will fix you up in
no time. Here, hang on me, and we'll go hunt him up."

"I'm all right!" Freddy protested, and hung back. "Stick to the
subject. How do you figure my coming a cropper was a break? I certainly
don't follow you there!"

"Sure it's a break," Dave said excitedly. "The luckiest break you and I
ever bumped into. And it was certainly luck, all of it. Don't you see,
Freddy? Our little rat friend is worried. He's not sure whether we've
got him spotted or not. He's got a job to do, see? He wants to be sure
he'll be able to do the job, so he tries to remove us from the picture
by crowning you. Get it?"

"Of course I don't get it!" Freddy Farmer snapped. "You're talking in
blasted riddles, Dave. Make sense!"

"Look, pal!" Dave said slowly. "We know darn well now that he's a
pilot, don't we?"

"Well, the lad who bashed me was, and is, a pilot," the English youth
admitted with a nod that made him wince.

"Okay, he's a pilot," Dave continued. "That means he plans to make
contact with the Japs by air, when out on patrol. He doesn't know if
we are keeping an eye on him, so he slugs you so that we won't go on
patrol this trick. See?"

"But what if we don't make the patrol?" Freddy cried. "What's that--?"

"For cat's sake, get it, Freddy!" Dave almost shouted. "It means that
_he is in our section_! It means that he is in our section and tried
to make sure that we wouldn't be aloft to keep our eye on what he did.
Don't you see? It _has_ to be that. If he were flying with some other
section, it wouldn't matter to him whether we flew our patrol trick
or not. But we're in the same section. So he lays you out just before
take-off time, figuring that before I can be assigned somebody else to
fly with me our section will be off and on its way. And I'll have to
wait over, or go off with the next section."

"Good grief, yes, of course!" Freddy Farmer breathed fiercely as his
eyes got as big as dinner plates. "For once, you're absolutely right,
Dave. The beggar is in our section. He has to be."

"Doggone right!" Dave echoed, and took hold of Freddy's arm. "Now
you come on aft to the sick bay, and get fixed up. I've got to work
fast and get the Exec to assign me somebody else to take your place.
Perhaps--"

"Somebody to take _my_ place!" Freddy Farmer cried angrily. "Over my
dead body! That's rot. I'm making the patrol with you. I--"

"But, Freddy, you got slammed pretty--"

"You can shut your trap, Dave Dawson!" the English youth snapped
viciously. "After all this waiting, if you think I'm going to go on
waiting while you make this patrol and perhaps get yourself into no end
of trouble, then you're completely balmy. Now, let go of my arm, and
stand aside, or you'll be the one to get bashed. And I mean it, Dave.
I'd still make this patrol even if the blighter had broken both my arms
and both my legs."

Dave hesitated a fraction of a second, then shrugged and sighed.

"You always were a hard-headed cuss," he grunted. "So I guess maybe he
didn't do so much damage as that. Okay, you old war horse. No sense
our breaking up the furniture. Come along. But let's both keep our eyes
skinned as we go topside. Look for a show of surprise on anybody's
face. Do you suppose he's two guys? The pilot and the rear gunner?"

"I don't care if he's a whole blasted squadron!" Freddy Farmer growled
as he pulled his helmet over his wounded head. "All I want is to see
the beggar make a slip, and be able to get at him. Nobody can bash my
head, and least of all some skunk Axis spy. Let's go."

Keeping step, the pair hurried across the hangar deck and went topside.
Six Douglas Devastator torpedo bombers had been rolled into take-off
position, and were waiting with props ticking over. There was a pilot
and gunner in each of five of the planes, and as Dave and Freddy
trotted toward their plane they cast keen glances at the flying members
of their section. But it didn't gain them a thing. As a matter of fact,
not a helmeted and goggled head was turned as they loped across the
flight deck and legged into their Devastator that was parked in number
four take-off position.

Two minutes later they were all set and ready to go. A minute after
that a flight officer came along the line of planes and handed each
pilot a copy of his patrol chart. And five minutes after that the
Flight Operations officer on the flight bridge pointed his finger at
the Number One plane, and nodded. The engine of that Devastator roared
up in full throated song, the deck mechanics stepped back from the
wing tips, and the plane rolled forward, picking up speed with every
revolution of its propeller. In less than nothing flat it was a moving
battle grey streak that finally let go of the deck and went curving
upward over the bow of the Indian toward the blue heavens above.

Hardly had the Number One plane cleared its wheels before the Flight
Operations officer stabbed his finger at the Number Two plane. It
streaked off in a thunderous roar, and the finger was pointed at the
Number Three plane. Then Four, then Five, and then Six, and the patrol
was in the air climbing for altitude before taking up formation for the
flight far out over the reaches of the Pacific.

Flying with the nonchalant ease, yet constant alertness, that comes
with experience, Dave held the Devastator steady and twisted around to
glance back at Freddy Farmer. The English youth was just a wee bit pale
about the gills, but there was a bright look in his eyes, and a tight
grin on his lips. Dave winked and nodded down at the Indian.

"Want to change your mind, pal?" he called out. "I can take you down
with no trouble at all. How do you feel?"

"Never better!" Freddy shouted. "Just take me down, and it'll be the
last landing you'll ever make. I'm up here to stay, my little man!"

Dave laughed, but there was just a little tightness to it.

"And do I hope that's the truth!" he cried. "Didn't see anything as we
went to the plane, did you?"

"Not a sign," Freddy replied. "I don't think any of them even looked at
us. Maybe he figured he'd done the job good on me, and that only five
planes would take the air."

"Well, the rat knows different now!" Dave grated, and turned front. "He
knows there are six ships up here, and that we're in one of them."

As Dave spoke the words he let his gaze wander from plane to plane in
the formation. Oddly enough, a lump formed in his chest, and there
was an empty feeling in his stomach. He had met and talked with every
member of that patrol in the air. Kidded with them, played cards, and
done all of the things one does with one's shipmates. It was hard,
terribly hard to believe that one of them, possibly two, were earning
blood money from Berlin or Tokio. Every one of them had struck him as
being a swell guy. A swell guy, or one of the best actors that ever
stepped on a stage. It didn't seem possible that savage hatred for
the United States, for the whole civilized world, was flying along in
the formation. It just didn't seem possible. Could he be wrong? Could
both Freddy and he be all wet in their deductions? Had Freddy actually
been slugged by accident, perhaps by a blundering mechanic carrying
something heavy? Had he got scared at what he'd done, and dragged
Freddy under that wing and taken to his heels? And had Freddy made a
mistake about his wearing pilot's garb? Could it have been simply that?

Those and countless other questions churned around in Dave's head as he
stared at the other planes in the formation droning northward over the
seemingly endless sky blue waters of the Pacific. Whether the answers
that came to mind were right or wrong, he had no way of telling. Only
time would tell that. In a short while the formation would spread out
so as to cover as great an area as possible. Then would be the time
for the murderer of Commander Jackson and Lieutenant Commander Pollard
to make his move, whatever it was going to be.

However, when the Indian and her destroyer escort disappeared from
view down over the lip of the southern horizon, and the patrol planes
were spread out in wide line formation, nothing happened. Each plane
continued droning along its prescribed course, its pilot and gunner
keeping a constant lookout for telltale shadows under the water below
them that might be Japanese submarines. And as the minutes piled up
on one another, nothing continued to happen. Fresh doubts and fresh
worries tugged at Dave's brain. Then, as a sudden thought came to him,
he turned his head and stared thoughtfully at Freddy Farmer.

The English youth grinned, opened his mouth to say something smart, but
checked himself as he saw the little lines of worry on Dave's forehead.

"What now?" he asked. "Did you forget something back on the ship? Or is
this another hunch? Know what I've been thinking?"

"I think I have an idea what it is," Dave said. "The same thing
I've been thinking, maybe. That he's suddenly called things off.
He realizes that he didn't stop us from making this patrol, so he's
decided not to take a chance yet. That it?"

"Something like that," the English youth replied with a grave nod.
Then with a puzzled twist of his head, he added, "But maybe a little
more than that. I mean that perhaps something else hasn't turned out
as he planned. Perhaps he was sure that we'd sight enemy craft, but we
haven't, so there isn't anything he can do but stay with the formation."

"Yeah, I get what you mean," Dave grunted. "If he should break
formation cold, now, and go tearing off on his own, it might make the
Section Leader go tearing after him to herd him back into place."

"Yes," Freddy said. Then, with a startled look: "Unless _he_ happens to
be the Section Leader!"

"Boy, the things you can think up!" Dave cried. Then, with a curt shake
of his head: "No, that's out, I'm positive. Our Section Leader wears
the Navy Cross and the Navy Medal of Valor. If he won those and then
turned Axis spy and killer, then I give up. That would be too much for
even me to believe. No, Freddy, our Section Leader is the one bird in
this bunch who's okay in my book."

"Quite, and in mine, too," Freddy said. "It was just a sudden thought
that hit me. I spoke it without thinking. No, it has to be somebody
else. But I wish the blighter would tip his hand and do something.
We're getting near the end of the patrol, and we haven't sighted a
thing. We'll soon be turning back, and then it will be too late for him
to try anything. He'll--I say!"

"What's up?" Dave cried as a look of horror flashed over the English
youth's face for an instant.

"Listen!" Freddy cried. "If the beggar has decided to pass it up this
time and try later, it'll be up to _you_ to get your head bashed, see?
I've had my share of it. Next time it's you."

"There's not going to be any next time!" Dave growled. "There just
can't be. Whatever's going to happen has got to happen on this patrol.
Any more of this nerve slicing waiting, and I'll go bats."

"You won't be alone, I fancy," Freddy murmured, and returned to
studying the rolling blue swells of the Pacific below.

Dave turned front and gave his attention to his flying. And for the
next twenty-five minutes the Devastator droned along on its job of
flying, with neither of the two youths saying a word. At the end of
that time the Section Leader fired a brace of very-light signals into
the air to signify that the patrol had reached its farthest point
north. Then he banked around toward the south again. The five other
planes banked around, and as the turn was made Dave glued his eyes on
the other planes and half held his breath in expectation. But he was
doomed to disappointment. No plane refused to turn and went streaking
away on its own. All of them swung about gracefully in formation and
started drilling back toward the south and the Carrier Indian far down
over the edge of the horizon.

"Well, so that's that!" Dave muttered bitterly. "I was either all wet,
or he decided not to take the chance this trip. Or maybe it was because
we didn't sight any--"

He didn't finish the rest. At that moment Freddy Farmer's fist came
down on his shoulder, and the English youth's voice cried out in wild
excitement.

"Look at Number Two plane way over there, Dave! It seems to be having
engine trouble. It's spouting smoke from the exhaust, and is nosing
down!"

"A forced landing!" Dave cried without thinking as he watched the
Number Two plane start to lose altitude. "What a tough break for those
two guys! They'll have to sit down and float until--Hey! What am I
talking about? I must be nuts! Freddy!"

"Absolutely!" the English youth cried, and nodded his head vigorously.
"It's easy to give your engine a bad mixture feed and make the exhaust
smoke. An easy trick when you want to break away from a formation, and
make it look as though you have to. Dave! I'll bet you anything you
want that that engine hasn't got anything more wrong with it than ours
has!"




CHAPTER SIXTEEN

_Water Rats_


"No bet, no bet!" Dave cried, and clenched and unclenched his free fist
in his excitement. "I think, too, that bird is pulling a trick. He's
going down, and he knows that none of us will follow him down, because
there's nothing we could do to help. We're land planes, not seaplanes.
It would be up to the rest of us to get back to the Indian in a hurry
and report that he had to sit down, and where."

"But I wonder, Dave," Freddy Farmer grunted as a sudden frown creased
his brows. "Look. It stands to reason that he couldn't _know_ he was to
make this exact patrol at this exact time. So it couldn't very well be
that he planned to land in the water and have a waiting Jap submarine
pick him up. That would be silly. He might float for days before a
submarine came along to pick him up. And--well, how in the world could
he plan to meet one at this spot? Maybe it is the real thing, Dave.
Maybe it is a forced landing that couldn't be helped. See what I mean?"

Dave didn't make any reply. He stared hard at the Number Two plane as
it spat smoke from its exhausts, and slowly lost altitude. Freddy was
quite right. It could be that what he was watching was very genuine;
that tough luck had dropped down out of the blue Pacific sky to smack
a couple of Uncle Sam's Navy eagles. Yet he couldn't believe that was
true. Something inside of him--he didn't know what--refused to let him
believe that it was all open and aboveboard.

"Could be, could be," he muttered over and over again to himself as the
patrol started leaving the crippled plane to its rear. "Could be, yes.
But, doggone it, we're going to make sure. We've got plenty of gas,
Freddy. We can find our way back to the Indian alone. I'm turning back
and going down to have a good look at those guys. I have a feeling that
maybe they won't actually land in the water. They may--Hey! They did!
Look at them, Freddy! That pilot is swinging around toward the north
and trying to put as much distance as possible between his plane and
the rest of us."

"Yes, he's doing just that!" Freddy shouted in return. "And if I were
force landing I'd try to glide as long as I could in the direction
of possible help. But he's banking around and gliding away from the
Indian's position."

"Gliding nothing!" Dave howled, and dropped the Devastator's wing and
started swinging it around. "That engine of his is not cooked. He's
using it just enough to keep him almost level. Hang on, Freddy! We're
going to take a look at that bird, and no kidding. A close look, too. I
think it will make him mad. So keep on your toes, pal. 'Most anything
can happen now. And maybe it will!"

Freddy didn't say anything to that. He simply hung on hard and sat
tight as Dave whipped the Devastator around and stuck the nose down.
The other plane was a good ten miles away by now, and fast becoming not
much more than a small smudge of black silhouetted against the blue
water. Holding the plane steady, Dave took time out to twist his head
around and stare back at the rest of the patrol. He wondered if the
Section Leader, seeing two planes dropping out of formation, would get
curious himself. But whether or not the Section Leader was curious, he
made no attempt to quit his other planes and turn back also. The patrol
kept on drilling southward.

Turning front again, Dave instantly picked up the other Devastator.
And as he did so his heart leaped in his chest, and the blood began
to pound through his veins. Smoke had stopped spewing from the engine
exhaust. The plane had even stopped gliding. As a matter of fact, it
was on even keel, and racing northward at full throttle not more than
three or four thousand feet above the surface of the Pacific. That
fact alone told Dave that after eight days and eight nights the gods
of war had decided to give Freddy and him a real break. He knew, just
as though a voice were shouting it in his ears, that the pilot of that
Devastator thundering northward was in the pay of the Axis. And for
some reason he felt equally sure that the Devastator's gunner was of
the same breed.

One thing that had puzzled him ever since Colonel Welsh had told of the
double murder aboard the Aircraft Carrier Indian was whether one man or
two had taken part in that gruesome affair. He had believed it was two
for the reason that if there had been just one man, he would have been
unable to kill both of the Indian's officers before one of them jumped
him, or tried to, at least. And both had been shot right between the
eyes. That fact, and other bits of reasoning, had led him to believe
all along--though he had not spoken of it to Freddy Farmer--that they
were after two Axis spies, not just one.

And as he sent the Devastator rocketing downward and to the north, he
felt more convinced than ever that such was the truth.

"I could be wrong," he grunted softly as he kept his eyes fixed
steadfastly on the other plane, "but I don't think so. Nope, I don't
think so."

"Dave!" Freddy's voice suddenly screamed in his ear again. "Look to
starboard and ahead, on the horizon line. I think I spot smoke from the
funnel of some surface ship. Can you see it, too?"

Dave tore his gaze from the plane ahead and stared hard in the
direction of the English youth's pointed finger. But all he could see
was an endless expanse of blue water across which the shadows of coming
night were beginning to steal. Where the water met the sky was little
more than a blurred line to him. If there was smoke from a surface
ship on that horizon line, he couldn't see it. However, many times had
Freddy Farmer's eagle, X-ray eyes picked up things before he did. And
so his heart began to dance about in his chest with wild excitement.
And for the umpty-umpth millionth time he experienced that familiar
eerie sensation at the back of his neck that seemed always to come to
him when trouble and danger were in the offing.

"You sure, Freddy?" he called out. "I can't see a darn thing. It's all
just horizon line to me."

"I'm not dead sure, but pretty sure," his pal replied. "It looks to
me like--Yes, I _am_ dead sure, Dave. That is smoke, a lot of it,
from some craft that's traveling at top speed. Eastward, I think. And
look at that Devastator, Dave! He's seen it, now. Look! He's banking
northeast to intercept it. Dave! If that's smoke from a Jap warship,
then we'll know we're right!"

"I know it now!" Dave cried. "Doggone well I do. Look at that rat tear!
His engine is hitting top revs. Ten to one he's spotted us and is
trying to give us the shake. Well, he won't. Not while we've got the
altitude and can gain extra speed in a dive. Hold your hat, Freddy.
I'm going to give this power plant all she can take. And be ready with
those rear guns. He may start to get tough."

As Dave shouted the last, he jerked his head around and took a quick
sweeping glance back toward the south. There was nothing there but
darkening blue sky. Not a sign of the rest of the patrol. It had passed
on out of sight on its journey back to the Indian. Dave swallowed
impulsively and turned front again. His heart had stopped bouncing
around. It had become a cold lump that hung suspended in his chest.

Any faint hope that he might have help with whatever was ahead had
passed out of the picture. Just Freddy and he were left. It was up to
them to finish the job they had started so long ago. How long ago,
anyway? A week, a month, or ten years? It seemed even longer than that
since that man reading the book in the room with the pails and mops had
told them to go on into Colonel Welsh's secret offices. But how long
ago it was didn't matter now. Freddy and he had come to the end of the
trail. Luck, blind luck mostly, had brought them to the end of their
manhunt. But blind luck, or very clever brainwork, what difference?
Down there and ahead was a Navy torpedo bomber streaking north and east
to cut across the bow of some surface vessel. An American vessel? Not a
chance. It had to be Jap. And Dave was ready to bet his life that it
was.

He could see the trail of smoke now. And Freddy had been right. It was
coming from a surface ship with engines turning over at top speed.
Perhaps it was a Jap destroyer, or a cruiser, or even possibly one of
Nippon's big battle wagons. He didn't know. The ship was still down
below the horizon line. But she was traveling, and traveling plenty
fast.

"There go his torpedo and bombs!" Freddy Farmer suddenly shouted. "That
means he has spotted us and dumped his load to pick up all the speed
he could. He's our man, Dave. He's our man. And I'll bet you all the
pounds Sterling in England that that's a Jap ship he's trying to reach.
Blast the dirty beggars. We can't let him get away with it, Dave. We
just can't. Not now."

"Shut up and sit tight!" Dave snapped, and jammed the palm of his
free hand against the already wide open throttle, as though in so
doing he might get even more speed out of the thundering engine in
the Devastator's nose. "He won't if we can possibly prevent it. We're
gaining on him, and I think he knows it. Look! See the pilot turning
around and looking back? And, Freddy, that bird in the rear pit is
unlimbering his guns! Get set, but be sure they fire the first shots.
We've got to make sure, Freddy, right up until there's no doubt about
it at all."

Even as Dave shouted the words, he slid his hand up the control
stick and snapped off the safety guard over the little red button
he pressed to fire his guns. The first tingling thrill and heart
chilling excitement was gone now. He felt perfectly cool, and calm,
and collected. No, it wasn't because he was any superman with nerves
of steel that no power on earth could break. It was simply that he
had flown straight into danger too many times to go all haywire and
jittery. This, you might say, was old stuff to Freddy and him. They had
been through it in France, and in England, and in Libya, and over the
broad Atlantic, and out in the Far East. A thousand times they had gone
hurtling into sky battle. And after that many times you get used to
taking it in stride.

And so with measured movements he prepared himself for battle, if
battle was to come. And that battle was to come seemed just as certain
as that night was to come. And soon.... Soon? Just about four split
seconds later he knew definitely that engines were going to whine
under strain of violent aerial combat maneuvers, and that machine
guns were going to crackle and yammer all over that Pacific sky. He
knew it because the plane ahead and still below his altitude suddenly
veered sharply to the left, and pulled its nose up and around in a wing
screaming power zoom. And almost at the same instant Freddy's shouting
voice told Dave that he, too, knew the battle was about to begin.

"The blighter knows he can't shake us off!" the English youth cried.
"Realizes we have the altitude, and can come down for a cold meat shot,
if we want to. And he knows we will if that ship turns out to be Jap.
And it is a cinch it is. Right-o, Dave! As I recall, that chap's a
pukka pilot. Name's Miller, isn't it?"

"That's what we called him!" Dave replied as he tried in vain to
remember the face of the Devastator's pilot. "And his gunner is named
Kaufman, I think. Miller and Kaufman! I wonder how they spell their
real German names. I--Here he comes. And shooting! That tears it,
Freddy! He's opened fire. So it's for keep, now."

"Get after him, Dave!" Freddy screamed. "Get in close and let me at the
beggar. Bash me, will he? I fancy not again he won't!"

Like a battle grey comet gone completely haywire, the other Devastator
came tearing up and around, guns blazing as its pilot tried to cut in
under Dave and drill the belly of his ship. But he didn't even come
close. Dave held his plane in its roaring dive just long enough to let
fly with a single withering blast at the zooming ship; then he flung
over hard on one wing, and went curving around and up himself to hold
the advantage of his altitude. As he swung around, he heard Freddy
Farmer's rear pit guns chatter. He jerked his head and took a quick
look, and laughed out loud. Freddy's burst had obviously been too close
for comfort, for the other pilot was kicking out of his zoom and off to
the other side in a hurry.

"Atta boy, Freddy!" Dave yelled, and hauled his Devastator about in the
opposite direction. "Shoot his pants off, but save the coat and vest
for me. Let him--"

Dave cut the rest off short as he happened to glance back at Freddy.
The English youth had dropped hold of his guns and was staring
wide-eyed toward the north. Dave checked the question on his lips and
shot a quick look in that direction himself. What he saw made his heart
zoom up to bang hard against his back teeth, and stick there!

The smoke belching surface craft had come up over the northern horizon
into full view. It was a man of war, a heavy cruiser, and Dave did not
need a second look to recognize it as a Japanese cruiser. But that was
not what caused his heart to zoom up his throat and lock the air in his
lungs. Right behind the cruiser was another of the same class. Both
ships were slamming along through the water, and even as Dave stared at
them they changed course and veered around to the south.

On they came at top speed, and for a crazy instant Dave thought they
had sighted his Devastator and were steaming southward to blast him out
of the air with anti-aircraft fire. It was, of course, an absolutely
crazy idea, and it was gone almost as it was born. And then an inkling
of the truth cut through his brain. Cold chills rippled down his spine,
and the inside of his mouth went bone dry. He impulsively glanced at
his radio panel, and gave a savage nod of his head.

"That must be it!" he grated through clenched teeth. "The rats in that
other Devastator _did_ use their radio! They must have sent out the
Indian's position, and those cruisers heard it. Now they're racing
south to get the Indian under cover of darkness. That's it, sure as
shooting. The rats figure that if they can't deliver the stolen plans
of the battle operation in time, they can at least do some damage.
Yeah! Give away the Indian's position and have her blown out of the
water with her planes helpless in the dark. Good grief! Why are such
vermin ever born?"

Dave didn't add anything to that. He didn't because there was even more
pressing business at hand. During the precious seconds he had gazed
pop-eyed at the two onrushing Japanese cruisers, the pilot of the other
Devastator had taken full advantage of the opportunity offered. He had
brought his plane wing screaming up and around, and was tearing in at
Dave and Freddy from the side. As a matter of fact, it was the savage
yammer of the English youth's guns that snapped Dave out of his trance.
He jerked his head around, felt a tiny sting on one cheek, and saw a
section of the right side of his glass hatch seem to melt away into
nothing. Had he not turned his face just at that moment, he probably
would have lost a good part of his jaw.

He didn't take time out to pat himself on the back for being so
fortunate. Fact is, he didn't take time out to do anything but
concentrate on slamming and booting the Devastator out of range of that
withering blast of fire. The instant he was in the clear he whipped out
his free hand to the release toggle that would drop the deadly torpedo
slung in the rack under the plane's belly. Even as his fingers touched
it he jerked his hand away and shook his head. No, he had to save
that steel fish until later. Freddy and he would have to risk having
it exploded by the fire from the other plane. And that went for the
Devastator's wing bombs, too. Freddy and he would need those in the big
battle to come, the battle against two heavy Jap cruisers.

"We've got to get the blighter in a hurry, Dave!" Freddy's voice of
confirmation suddenly cut his thoughts. "We've got to get him and not
let either of those cruisers pick him up--pick _them_ up. If they do,
everything is lost, Dave. They're bound to have those stolen plans of
battle operations with them, or at least stamped in their heads. If
they once get aboard either of those cruisers, everything will become a
terrible mess. It mustn't happen, Dave!"

"You're telling me?" Dave roared, and hauled the Devastator around in
a dime turn that virtually made the wings groan in protest, and the
threatening wave of a blackout rise up before his eyes. "You're doggone
right we can't let them make contact. Hang on, Freddy! And let go with
your guns the instant you get the chance. I'm going to charge them.
It's either them or us, Freddy!"

"All set!" the English youth howled back. "Let her rip, and blast their
dirty hearts!"

For a couple of split seconds Dave held the Devastator in its tight
turn, and kept his eyes glued on the other plane. It was banking around
to get underneath him and come thundering up for an all gun blast at
the belly of his plane. So he deliberately held his Devastator in the
tight turn until he saw the nose of the other ship start to come up.
The instant it started up, Dave slammed farther over on wing, kicked
rudder hard and dropped the nose down to the vertical.

Like a battle grey streak of lightning, Dave's plane rocketed downward.
He leaned far forward, straining against his safety harness, and kept
his mouth open to relieve the pressure in his pounding ears. It was
as though a thousand fingers of steel were curled about his insides
and striving to rip and tear in all directions at the same time. White
balls of fire leaped and bounced around in his brain as the Devastator
went down at a terrific rate of speed. It was agony to try to breathe,
for the walls of his lungs seemed pressed flat against each other.

For perhaps three seconds the agony lasted, or maybe it was three
years. Then he was practically right on top of the other Devastator, so
close that he could actually see the whites of the pilot's fear-glazed
eyes staring up at him. The pilot was trying desperately to kick off to
the side and cut out from under Dave's diving plane. But there wasn't
time, and the terror in his eyes seemed to indicate that he realized it.

Three seconds, and then Dave jabbed his electric firing trigger. His
guns hammered and pounded out nickel-jacketed destruction, and a hail
of doom tore into the other Devastator like red hot pokers slashing
into snow. The plane actually leaped off to one side like a bird nailed
in full flight. It rolled over twice, and its right wing started to
tear away in shreds. As Dave went thundering on past it he heard Freddy
Farmer's gun taking up where he had left off. A moment or so later he
was able to ease his plane out of its wing straining dive and circle up
and around and back.

Almost reluctantly he slid his finger off the trigger button. There
wasn't any need to continue drilling the crippled plane. It was shy
one wing, and was slip sliding about in the air like a dead leaf in a
raging gale. Its propeller was still spinning over, but even as Dave
looked at it black smoke belched out from under the engine cowling, and
licking tongues of flame went darting backward.

"Poor devils, just the same," Dave heard his own voice mutter. "But
they're probably stone dead now, anyway, so the fire won't add to
their--"

He never finished the rest. Rather, he finished it with a wild shout
of anger and maddening defeat. The pilot and gunner of the other
Devastator were not dead. By a miracle the withering fire from Dave's
guns and from Freddy's guns had passed them by. On the contrary, they
were very much alive. Out of anger-filmed eyes, Dave saw both of them
push up out of their bullet-shattered greenhouse and leap out into
space and down toward the rolling blue waters of the Pacific.

Both the pilot and gunner were alive! Both had bailed out with their
parachutes! Both would land in the water--and both could very easily be
picked up by either of the onrushing Japanese cruisers. The gods of war
were screaming with glee. A valiant effort by two valiant war eagles
serving Uncle Sam was going for a complete loss, would completely fail
in its purpose.




CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

_Eagle Madness_


A thousand little demons seemed to be screaming their mocking laughter
in Dave's ears as he watched the two parachute envelopes billow out and
catch in the wind. Seething white rage boiled up within him, and he
impulsively started to kick his Devastator around and down toward those
two flying garbed figures swaying like clock pendulums at the ends of
their parachute shroud lines. But even as he started to drop down, he
made strangling noises in his throat and pulled the Devastator up onto
even keel.

"I can't do it!" he cried hoarsely. "I can't shoot them like a couple
of helpless dogs. That's murder. That's the Nazi way. That's not our
way. I just can't do it."

"But we've got to do something, Dave!" Freddy Farmer screamed in his
ear. "Satan himself must have saved them. And look, Dave! That leading
cruiser! She's shot one of her scouting planes off the forward
catapult. A seaplane! They're going to land and try to pick them up,
sure as you're born. That means they know perfectly well who those two
beggars are, and what they've got."

Dave nodded grimly, but didn't bother to make any reply for the moment.
Icy fingers were once again coiling about his heart. He knew that
Freddy Farmer had spoken the truth, if the truth had ever been spoken
by anyone. Yes, it was certain that the commanders of those two Jap
cruisers knew that the two U. S. Naval Aviation clad figures floating
slowly down toward the water possessed the information that the entire
Jap Navy had been waiting to receive.

Word of what had happened aboard the Indian in San Diego harbor a
few weeks before had of course leaked ashore. Axis Fifth Columnists
had gathered up that news and passed it on higher up. It was a dead
certainty that the instant the Indian had weighed anchor and sailed
out of San Diego harbor, word had been flashed to the Japanese Navy
command, and from there to all of the Nipponese sea units on patrol.
True, they probably didn't know where the Indian was bound, or what
she would do when she reached her destination. Dave felt very sure
that the secret of the surprise attack on the Marshall Island group
was something the Japs still didn't know, or even suspect. However, it
was equally certain that they knew that two of their spies were aboard
the Indian. And, also, that they possessed information that was worth
a major naval victory to the Japanese. For that reason every unit of
the Jap Navy was on the lookout for the Indian. And every one of its
brown-skinned rats, from the admirals down, had been waiting with
savage expectancy for the spies to make some kind of contact.

That contact was now close to being made. It was unquestionably luck
that had sent the bogus Miller and Kaufman off on this particular
patrol. And it was undoubtedly luck that had placed these two Jap
cruisers just a little north of the end of the plotted patrol course.
However, war without luck, and miracles happening left and right, just
isn't war. And now there were the two Axis spies floating down toward
the water, and there were the two Nipponese cruisers. And one of them
had already catapulted one of its scouting seaplanes to land and pick
up the two airmen.

All that, and more, whizzed through Dave's brain in nothing flat. Then
he tore his eyes off the two men going down by parachute and fastened
them on the Jap cruiser's seaplane skimming along the surface of the
water. One look, and then he went into action again.

"That's their mistake!" he shouted, and slammed the Devastator's nose
down. "Like picking off clay ducks in a shooting gallery. But those rat
Japs are asking for it. So they get it!"

Dave emphasized the last with a savage nod of his head and slid his
finger over the trigger button. By then the Jap seaplane pilot saw
what was going to happen. He hauled the nose of his plane up as though
to give battle. Almost immediately, though, he got cold feet and went
cartwheeling around toward the east. But it didn't do him any good. He
might just as well have tried to zoom up and hide behind the setting
sun. Dave had him cold in his sights, and the Jap was caught like a rat
in a trap.

One long burst from Dave's wing guns. Another long burst from Freddy
Farmer's guns, as Dave banked off and gave his pal an aim, and that was
that. The slow Jap seaplane came apart as though it had flown full tilt
into a brick wall. It seemed to explode all over the place and hit the
water in a shower of small pieces. Dave instantly nosed up and twisted
around for another look at the steaming cruisers still a considerable
distance away. Even as he spotted them, he saw tongues of flame stab
out from their forward decks, and the air about him was filled with a
roar akin to that of an express train racing into the yawning mouth of
a tunnel. A blood-chilling roar, and then the Pacific sky was splotched
with bursting anti-aircraft shells that glowed red and orange and
yellow all at the same time.

Dave grinned, tight-lipped, and instantly nosed down. It had been
a pretty rotten bit of shooting, even for Jap gunners. But maybe
they weren't to blame. Dave's Devastator was too low for their angle
of fire, and the shells exploded well above the Devastator. Just
the same it was no cause for great joy. On the contrary it was an
advanced warning of what the Jap cruiser commanders intended to do. A
ten-year-old child could guess what it was, too.

Realizing that it was useless to pick up the two parachutists by
seaplane, the Japs were going to hold Dave and Freddy at bay by the
sheer power of their concentrated fire, and steam alongside the two
spies, who were no longer floating down through the air, but had hit
the water and were floating around in their orange-colored life
jackets. Dave cast a quick glance down at those two gobs of orange in
the water, and groaned in bitter exasperation. How simple if Freddy and
he were fighting on Adolf Hitler's and Hirohito's side! All he would
have to do would be to stick the nose down at those two orange spots in
the water and no more than brush his finger across the trigger button
of his guns. Just a short burst and two rats would be dead, never to
reveal what they knew. How simple, how easy it would be to do it that
way!

But he couldn't. And he knew that deep in his heart, and in his soul.
No matter how much he hated the Nazis and the Japs, and all the
ruthless, rotten things they stood for, it wasn't a hate that could
make him murder in cold blood. He and Freddy would have to accomplish
their purpose some other way.

Some other way? Those three words exploded in his brain like bombs. As
more shells from the cruisers' guns exploded well overhead, he twisted
around in the seat and stared at Freddy Farmer. The English youth was
gripping his guns with white knuckles and staring down at the floating
spies. But stamped on Freddy's face was the very same thing that was
in Dave's brain. It would be so very, very simple. Yet it couldn't be
done. It wasn't the way of the civilized white man.

"We've got to try it, Freddy!" Dave shouted, and was conscious of the
dry tightness in his throat. "It's our only hope--our only one. If
either cruiser gets alongside those two rats in the water--"

Dave stopped and let a shrug speak the rest. Freddy turned his eyes
from the surface of the water, looked at him, and nodded grimly.

"Quite!" he said, tight-lipped. "Us against those two blasted cruisers.
We're mad even to try it. If a single one of their shells gets close
before we've got rid of our torpedo and bombs, why then--"

It was Freddy's turn to cut off his words, and let a gesture of his
hand finish the sentence.

"Yeah, we'd probably come down on the moon, or on a star!" Dave
shouted, and banked the Devastator around toward the north. "We can
get one with our torpedo, and go after the other with our bombs. Darn
it, anything to stop them from picking up those two rats, finding out
things, and getting busy on the radio. It's a job that can't be done,
Freddy. But, heck! We've got to _do_ it!"

"Then get on with it!" the English youth cried. "They may try to
catapult more planes, and we certainly can't do a million different
things at once."

"Here we go!" Dave roared, and pushed the Devastator's nose down. "Good
luck to us both, Freddy. And it's been nice knowing you, pal!"

If Freddy Farmer made any reply, Dave didn't hear it. The engine in the
nose was roaring out full blast, and the gunners aboard the two Jap
cruisers, realizing what was happening, were opening up with everything
they had. The din that hammered and pounded through that section of the
Pacific sky was akin to that of worlds colliding. Hunched tight-lipped
over the stick, Dave sent the torpedo bomber all the way down until
its belly was almost slapping the water. There he leveled off, banked
around to the left and headed directly for a broadside shot at the
leading Japanese cruiser.

Squinting ahead was like looking into the mouth of an exploding blast
furnace. Every gun, from small machine guns and pom-poms to the big
stuff, was hurling roaring steel in his direction. Everything else
seemed to fade out of his vision. He could see nothing but that moving
wall of spouting flame and smoke directly ahead. Split seconds seemed
to take years in passing. A hundred times he was tempted to release
the torpedo and zoom up for safe altitude. But each time he killed the
desire.

The Devastator carried one torpedo, and he had to make it good. He
couldn't take any chances of missing the sleek side of that steaming
cruiser. He had to get in close, real close, and then slam home the
steel fish. A bow hit or a stern hit wouldn't count. It had to be
square amidships, where the explosion would tear the heart out of the
Jap craft and sink it like a rock. He had to--

The Devastator suddenly seemed to half stop and lurch crazily to the
side as a furious blast of fire from the enemy cruiser's guns crashed
into it. Dave had the feeling that he had been slapped in the face with
a barn door. He went dumb and stiff from the top of his head to the
bottom of his feet. Everything turned into spinning red light before
his eyes. He knew that he was lashed to the seat, and that both hands
gripped the controls with fingers of steel. But he wasn't sure.

He wasn't sure of anything any more! Was Freddy Farmer still with him
in the Devastator? Was the plane still with him, for that matter? Or
had the withering blast of gunfire from the Japanese cruiser sent him
sailing off into thin air and death?

He mustn't die now. Not yet! The suicide mission had only begun. The
aerial torpedo was still in its rack under the Devastator's belly. Or
was it? Had the cruiser's gunfire touched it off--and had Freddy and he
failed?

"Freddy! Freddy Farmer! Are you with me, fellow? Are you still there,
pal?"

Was that his own voice he heard--that faint little squeak that sounded
in his ears? If only he could see something besides the darned dancing
balls of light. If only he could get his muscles to move. But they
wouldn't move. His whole body had been turned to stone, and he was
falling straight down through a world of blazing flame. He was--

Suddenly it was as though a gigantic invisible hand had reached out and
wiped away all the dancing colored light from in front of his eyes.
Like a man waking up from a heavy sleep, he found himself staring at
the instrument panel of the Douglas Devastator. He lifted his gaze,
stared through the bullet-shattered front of his glass hatch, at the
nose of the plane with its whirling prop--and at the shadow-filled
Pacific sky beyond!

"You're nuts, you're completely cockeyed. You should be falling down,
not zooming _up_!"

The sound of his own voice seemed to come to him from a great distance.
He tried to shake his head, and found that he could. The movement
dashed some of the cobwebs and the fog from his brain. He started to
turn around in the seat when something hit him a terrific clip on
the shoulder. It was Freddy Farmer's fist, and the English youth was
yelling his head off.

"Bull's-eye, Dave! A perfect bull's-eye! But I thought for fair you
were going to ram us straight into the cruiser's fighting top. Look
at her! Look at her! Goodbye, you dirty brown rats! I only wish your
big-toothed Emperor was with you. Make war on decent people, will you,
you rotten beggars!"

"Hey! What gives?" Dave cried, as his still slightly benumbed brain
refused to grasp the true meaning of Freddy Farmer's half screamed
words. "What in thunder are you raving about?"

"What's _that_?" Freddy cried, and peered at him in dumbfounded
amazement. "You don't--"

The English youth choked himself off, and the amazement in his eyes
changed to a look of alarm. At almost the same instant Dave began to
feel a dull ache on the left side of his head. He impulsively reached
up his hand and touched strips of his torn helmet. The strips were wet
and sticky, and when he lowered his hand it was to see his fingers
stained with his own blood.

"Well, knock me for a loop!" he gulped foolishly. "Somebody, or
something, must have slugged me!"

"I'll say!" Freddy cried. "A piece of shrapnel, I guess. A lot of it
hit us. But are you all right, Dave? Does it hurt much? Had I better
take over the controls? The other cruiser is--"

"_Cruiser?_" Dave boomed. And then like a curtain snapping up to flood
his brain with light, he suddenly remembered where he was, why, and
what had happened. He _had_ actually fired the torpedo at the cruiser.

Ignoring another question that spilled off Freddy's lips, he twisted
in the seat, automatically shoved the Devastator down onto even keel
and stared down over the side. What he saw made his breath catch in his
throat, and his heart stand still in awe and gruesome horror.

One of the cruisers was way over on its side and well down by the
stern--that is, what little he could see of her. Mostly it was a
boiling patch of red flame in the water that fountained upward and
outward to hurl licking tongues of fire out in all directions. In
a crazy sort of way he knew that the cruiser's powder magazine had
probably exploded. At any rate, the craft was being ripped to shreds as
though her steel plates were so much paper.

Then, suddenly, as he moved his gaze across the water, he saw a sight
that made him cry out in terror, and shudder violently. He saw two tiny
spots of orange almost directly in the path of the keeled over cruiser.
And then he didn't see them any more. A tongue of boiling flame,
perhaps an oil drum or something on fire, came slashing straight out
of the smoke-filled air and down on that spot. The flames splashed out
like drops of molten metal, and white spray rose up like a cloud. The
two spots of orange that were the life jackets worn by the two spies
disappeared from view as though by magic. When the flames and the spray
melted away, the two spots of orange weren't there any more. There was
nothing but a smoking slick of oil.

"Poor devils!" Dave muttered shakily. "What a horrible way to die. They
were rats, but--but that was a terrible way for even rats to die.
They--"

The last was cut off as though by a knife. A section of the sky seemed
to drop down and explode right on the nose of the Devastator. For a
brief instant Dave found himself in a world of utter darkness. Then
the plane went tearing out into clear light again. It was shuddering
and trembling like a spent race horse. He knew without looking that
the right wing had been blasted by bits of shrapnel, and that the tip
was beginning to flutter. Instinct and instinct alone caused him to
shove the nose down and lose altitude fast. But even as he went down he
knew that losing altitude wasn't going to help much. The second of the
Japanese cruisers was just ahead and below. And every gun aboard her
was thundering away at the Devastator at practically point blank range.




CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

_Death Hates To Lose_


"Our bombs, Dave! Can you get us down lower and right over the blasted
thing?"

Above the thundering roar of bursting anti-aircraft shells, Freddy
Farmer's voice came to Dave as little more than a whisper. He heard it
nevertheless, and nodded his head vigorously to let the English youth
know that he had heard. They were right in the middle of the cruiser's
fire now. It was just as safe to keep on going down on her as it was
to try and break away. So long as he was able to dive, the Devastator
presented a difficult target for the Jap gunners. But should he pull
out of the dive, and arc off to either side, the Devastator would then
instantly become a target tripled in size.

No, there was but one thing to do: to go on down on her and then let
go with their wing bombs in the last instant allowed. That their bombs
might put the cruiser out of action, to say nothing about sinking
her, was completely out of the question. It was plain silly even to
hope that such a miracle as that would come to pass. But it would be
possible to put some of her guns out of action. And it was just barely
possible, too, that the bombs might damage the craft enough to force
the Jap commander to reduce her speed. That at least would be something.

Yes, indeed. If the cruiser was forced to reduce speed, she would at
least have to give up the search for the Carrier Indian. And now that
the two spies were gone, it was only logical that the Jap commander
would go steaming southward in a desperate effort to find the Indian
and pounce upon her in the dark.

"Sure, give her all you can!" Dave muttered as he hunched forward over
the stick of the diving plane. "But don't kid yourself why. You know
why, and _how_ you do! Her fire has you bracketed. You'll catch it
cold no matter which way you turn. So there's only one thing you _can_
do. Slam down and give her all you've got left before your number and
Freddy's number go up. Down--and give her all you can, while you can."

A wild desire to twist his head around and see how Freddy Farmer was
taking it possessed Dave for a moment--but only for a moment. Just as
suddenly he didn't want to see Freddy's face. Because of the look of
certain death he felt sure he would see there? He didn't know. Because
he was afraid that Freddy might read the truth in his own eyes? He
didn't know. Only one thing seemed certain. Freddy Farmer and Dave
Dawson had at long last come to the end of the trail. Their luck, if
luck it was, had run out.

He wasn't afraid to die, though. Perhaps that was because he had faced
death so many, many other times and managed to skin through. Anyway, he
did not feel fear inside of him. Funny, but the sensation that rippled
through him was one of fierce satisfaction. Satisfaction at completing
a job that had seemed utterly impossible right from the very start.
Bull luck? Blind luck? Okay, call it anything you wanted to, but the
fact remained that two murdering Axis agents had failed to win through
at the very last moment. They were dead, and all they knew was dead
with them. Their corpses were but two of the hundreds the exploding
cruiser had scattered all over that section of the Pacific. Yes, they
were dead. Their information was lost to the Japs. And Freddy Farmer
and he had paid back a little bit on the Pearl Harbor account. They
had blasted a Jap cruiser out of the war and the world for keeps. That
was something, anyway--little something extra for the Old Man with the
whiskers, Uncle Sam.

Too bad the Devastator didn't carry a couple of torpedoes, so that they
could slam a death blow into the second cruiser as they went down the
long trail that has no end. Too bad, but no sense crying about it. The
plane had carried only one torpedo, and they had made full use of that
one. There were only the bombs left--bombs that might spill a lot of
Jap blood over the cruiser's decks, but would never go through her deck
plates to do real damage below. And so--

"So here goes!" Dave whispered softly as the gun-spitting cruiser
seemed to come sweeping up toward his spinning propeller. "Here goes
Freddy--and here I go. Something to remember us by!"

A sob rose up in Dave's throat and stuck. He winked his eyes that had
suddenly begun to sting. Then he grinned, and the grin grew into a
harsh, defiant laugh. The last split second had arrived. He had to
pull out and give Freddy a chance to release their wing bombs, or dive
on straight into the cruiser. He was tempted to do that last thing:
to slam straight in and go out in a roaring blaze of glory. But cold
fighting sense refused to permit him to do it.

He braced himself, hauled back on the stick, brought the nose up and
shot straight forward not twenty feet above the cruiser's fighting top.
One second more and he would streak right over the up-tilted muzzles of
the forward anti-aircraft guns. A target a blind man couldn't miss. A
target you could hit with rocks. One second more. Two at the most. Dump
the bombs, Freddy! Slam them down and blast some of those dirty brown
devils to the place where they and all their filthy back-stabbing breed
belong. Give it to them, Freddy. Give them all we've got left!

Dave didn't know whether he was roaring out the words, or whether
they were simply echoing around in his brain. He simply knew that the
Devastator was perched on the very brink of all eternity, and that he
was banging out the last of his bullets as a sort of final touch. He
only knew that--

But he didn't. He didn't know anything any more. He was completely lost
in a huge black cloud that pressed in on him from all sides. He was
right in the middle of it, and sailing away and away. The light of day
was gone, and night was all about him. Was it night, or was this what
death was like? Darkness. Thick darkness with a faint roaring in the
distance, and drifting to him from all sides.

"I can't be dead--my head hurts too darned much!"

The sound of his own voice in that cloud of darkness startled him so
that he cried out in fear. Then suddenly he felt himself sink down;
felt water in his mouth, his nose, his eyes, and in his ears. He
gasped, and water poured down his throat--salty, smoky tasting water.
And his lungs seemed to burst right out between his ribs. His brain
refused point blank to function, but the instinct of self-preservation
came to his rescue. Without realizing it, he kicked with his feet and
struck out blindly with his hands. He couldn't move his right hand,
though. There was something hanging onto it, a dead weight that made it
impossible for him to move his arm.

Then suddenly he was sucking and gurgling air into his lungs. Just
as suddenly the film over his eyes passed away, and he found himself
looking at a world of brilliant stars over his head. And just as
suddenly he realized that he was in the water, keeping himself afloat
with one hand, and clutching hold of Freddy Farmer's helmeted head with
the other, striving to keep the English youth's face out of water.

It was dark as pitch all about him. Yet when he winked the water from
his eyes a weird glow of light seemed to filter down from the stars. He
saw dark objects floating about him. There were pieces of wreckage, but
for the moment he could not summon the strength to swim toward them. In
a dulled sort of way he knew that something was wrong, that something
wasn't right. Then he knew what it was. His life jacket was gone, at
least half of it. The other half was in strips and wasn't of any use.
Freddy Farmer's life jacket was gone completely. In fact, he had on
nothing but his shirt. Dave could tell that when a swell lifted the
English youth's shoulder up out of the water.

Bit by bit Dave's brain began to click over at increased speed.
Presently it gave him the sense to take a good look at Freddy. He
pulled his pal closer, and as he did so held his breath in terror. But
God had been kind. Freddy Farmer was not dead. He was unconscious, but
he was breathing. A mighty sob of joy shook Dave's body. He clenched
his teeth, and summoned every ounce of strength in his half numb body.
He saw a large sized object floating by a few yards away. It looked
like the top side of a crate, or perhaps it was a bunk. He struck out
for it with one hand and two feet. Only a few yards away, but every
foot was a mile to Dave's straining efforts. His head pounded, and all
the colors of the rainbow flashed and whizzed around before his eyes.

Then finally his outstretched hand clutched hold of something. It felt
like a loop of rope, and it was fastened to the floating object. He
didn't bother to find out what the object was. He was quite content to
cling to the looped rope for several minutes and fight for his breath
and his strength. Eventually, though, he shifted his position in the
water, thrust up his hand and hooked it over the side of the object.
And it was then he made the joyful discovery. It was not a crate, or a
bunk. The object was a ship's raft--a life raft constructed something
like a rubber life raft. Airtight circular drums formed the sides, and
stout planks lashed together three thick formed the bottom of the raft.

Dave laughed and cried in the same breath, and then almost spent the
last of his strength in a mad effort to scramble onto the raft and
haul Freddy Farmer up with him. Three times he tried it, only to lose
his grip and slide back into the water, and under. He didn't try it
that way a fourth time. He forced himself to spend a good ten minutes
still clinging to the looped rope. Then, when renewed strength began
to seep slowly through his body, he worked Freddy Farmer's unconscious
body close to the raft, got one of the English youth's arms flung up
over the side, and then the other. Then inch by inch he worked the dead
weight up until Freddy went tumbling over and down onto the floor of
the raft.

It required another rest period of some ten minutes for Dave to dig
up some more strength. Then, grabbing hold with both of his hands, he
worked his body upward, muscles straining, strength ebbing away like a
punctured balloon spilling air, and all the firecrackers in the world
going off in his brain. It took years, it seemed, but he finally made
it. He got all the way in and fell sprawling down on top of Freddy
Farmer. He tried to push himself up and crawl off his pal, but that was
the moment when all the glittering stars in the heavens fell down and
hit him on top of the head.

His next sensation was that his whole body was on fire. He opened his
eyes, but it was like looking straight in through the opened door of a
blast furnace going full force. He closed his eyes, groaned, and tried
to move. It was then that water hit him smack in the face, and hands
took hold of him.

"Dave! Speak to me, Dave! It's Freddy. Dave! Please speak! Can you hear
me? Steady, lad, steady! Relax and let me hold you. Praise be to Allah!
I've been terrified for hours that you were a goner!"

With a tremendous effort Dave forced his eyes open. The glare of the
blast furnace was gone, but he could still feel the heat. For a few
seconds he didn't try to think. He didn't try to do anything except
relax, and let somebody hold him up, and keep the glare of that
blast furnace out of his eyes. He knew it must be Freddy Farmer. He
recognized the voice, and the voice had said so. Good old Freddy.
Always there at the right time. Never failed. One in a million. The
very best. The tops.

"Hold it, Dave!" Freddy's voice cried in his ears again. "Don't let go,
pal. Hold it. Buck up. Come on, now. There's a lad for you. Cheeri-o,
Dave!"

He found that his eyes were opened again, and that Freddy Farmer's
grinning face was but a foot from his own. He stared at it, grinned
himself, and suddenly strength and vitality began coursing through
his veins. He took his eyes off Freddy's face, looked about him, and
gulped. As far as he could see in any direction was nothing but a
limitless expanse of sky blue water--sky blue water filmed over with
golden light from the blazing sun hanging high in the heavens. He and
Freddy Farmer were alone in the life raft, completely alone. There
wasn't a drop of water, nor a package of food, or anything. The raft
was bare of all things that help to sustain life. Startling realization
brought sudden and violent hunger to his stomach, and a craving thirst
to his lips. He looked back to meet Freddy's eyes, and forced another
grin to his lips.

"Guess they don't want us up at the Pearly Gates yet, pal," he said
slowly. "But maybe this is all a dream, or something."

"It isn't!" Freddy said grimly. "I've been hoping so ever since
yesterday afternoon. But it's real, Dave. It's too blasted real, I say."

"Easy, Freddy!" Dave cried. "_Yesterday afternoon?_ Where do you get
that stuff? Why, it can't--!"

"It is!" Freddy interrupted. "I came to just before sundown. You were
sprawled over me. Phew! I thought you were stone dead. I managed to
wiggle out from under you, and prop you up. Bit too much for me,
though. I spent most of the night coming to and passing out again. I
felt better when dawn came. Took stock of things and saw there was
nothing to do but wait. Kept your face out of the sun, as much as
I could. And--well, I guess I prayed most of the time. Nothing has
happened, though. Nothing's passed by except some dead Japs, with some
sharks after them. They--"

The English youth paused and shuddered. Dave reached out a hand and
pressed his arm.

"Steady does it, Freddy," he said gently. "We're still alive. And we're
together. That's a lot in my book. And, heck! This is a whole lot
better than if that darned Jap cruiser had picked us up. I don't think
they'd have been very nice to us."

Freddy Farmer's jaw dropped, and his eyes went wide.

"Jap cruiser pick us up?" he gasped. "Are you balmy, Dave? It went down
like a rock. The blasted thing practically broke in two! You just
barely got us clear of the flying pieces before our wing came off and
we crashed in. Why--!"

"Whoa, hold her!" Dave shouted, and jerked himself up straight despite
the pain and aches it caused. "You mean we got that second cruiser?
You're nuts! Our bombs wouldn't even dent her plates. They--"

"They didn't!" Freddy cried. "A lucky hit. One went right down one of
her funnels. It must have, because I just had time to see the great
cloud of flame and smoke that belched up out of her funnel before
concussion was tossing us around like a leaf. It's the truth, Dave!
Didn't you see it? Worse than the one we'd torpedoed. She broke right
clean through. Then we crashed into the water. You yelled to me to
duck, and--well, that's the last I remember until I came to late
yesterday afternoon. How did you get us out of the wreck and aboard
this raft, anyway?"

"The first part of that we'll never know, Freddy," Dave said in an awed
voice. "Maybe it was two other guys, or something. I don't remember
a thing from the time I leveled out of the dive until I woke up in
the water, and had you by the helmet. It was night, and all sorts of
things were floating by. I saw this raft, but thought it was a crate,
and got us over to it. I got us both inside, and then went out like a
light. Sweet tripe, Freddy! We've been floating around in this thing
for at least two days and two nights. No wonder I could eat a horse,
whole, and drink a well dry. You've--you've seen nothing, Freddy? No
ship, no plane?"

Freddy shook his head.

"Nothing, Dave," the English youth said in a low voice. "The Pacific's
a pretty big place, you know. It's--_Dave_! What's the matter? You look
as if you'd seen a ghost!"

Dave shook his head, put out a hand and touched Freddy.

"Don't move, Freddy!" he said hoarsely. "Don't even look. It--it might
not be true. But--but, it is, _it is_! Look, Freddy! To the east. A
ship! It's a destroyer. She's heading this way. Look at her spill
smoke. She's heading this way. And it's Yank. I can tell from her
lines, and stacks. _Look_, Freddy! Lady Luck was just waiting until we
both woke up, that's all. She wanted us both to be surprised. She--"

Freddy's eyes turned to the east.

Dave raved on like a man gone delirious with joy, and he was. Words,
all kinds of crazy words babbled off his lips. And words, all kinds of
crazy words also spilled from Freddy Farmer's tongue as together they
watched one of Uncle Sam's destroyers come tearing down on them. She
swept up on them like a thing alive, slowed down just long enough to
cast off one of her boats, and then started circling about them. In
ten minutes grinning Navy gobs helped Dave and Freddy into the boat.
And about twenty minutes after that they were in sick bay aboard the
USS Paul Jones, and receiving the very best of medical treatment. It
was all they could do to keep awake, despite their gnawing hunger. The
wild excitement of rescue had been too much for either of them. It had
sapped their strength down to almost the last drop. But they managed
to keep awake long enough to ask questions, and receive astonishing
answers from the youthful lieutenant in command of the destroyer.

They learned that the attack on the Marshall Islands had been carried
out successfully. That a whole lot of what had happened at Pearl Harbor
had been paid back to the Sons of Nippon. They learned that they had
been afloat in the raft for three whole days and nights. They learned
that one Colonel Welsh had requested that special permission be given
Navy units in that section of the Pacific to search for them when it
was reported by scouting planes that cruiser wreckage had been seen
floating on the water. They learned that a searching plane had sighted
them from the air that very morning, although Freddy had not seen nor
heard it. The scouting plane had directed the Paul Jones to the spot.
They learned also that Jap sailors picked up from the area where the
cruisers had gone down had told of what they had done with one lone
Douglas Devastator.

"It was that report that set this Colonel Welsh to moving Heaven,
earth, and the Navy Department, to get a search going," the destroyer's
commander finished up. "He must have had the President with him,
because darned near the whole Pacific Fleet hopped right to it. Who is
this Colonel Welsh, anyway? Can't say I ever heard of him. He must be
quite a man when it comes to getting things done."

"Yeah," Dave mumbled drowsily. "Quite a man. Swell to work under. Got
a nice technique. Gets you so doggone mad you'd go out and fly without
wings, just to prove you could do it. Yeah, the Colonel knows his
stuff. Right, Freddy?"

Freddy Farmer didn't agree or disagree. He was already sound asleep!

_A Page from_ DAVE DAWSON WITH THE AIR CORPS

Throttling the Wright powered Vultee V-12C attack bomber to cruising
speed, Dave licked his dry lips, twisted around in the seat, and winked
at Freddy Farmer in the gunner's pit.

"How's it going, pal?" he called out. "Not nervous, or anything like
that, are you?"

"Certainly not!" the English youth shouted back. "I stopped being
nervous hours ago. Now I'm only scared stiff! How do you feel?"

Dave shrugged and made a little gesture with his free hand.

"I'm not sure," he said, "but I think it's something like the way a
clay pigeon must feel. You know, hoping the guy with the trap gun will
miss? Oh well, this may be just a waste of time."

"Not any more!" Freddy shouted, and pointed to the left. "Look!"

Dave turned his head and felt his heart zoom up to crack against his
back teeth. About seven miles off his left wing and hugging the under
side of a towering cloud bank, he spotted no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

PREFACE.


The very extensive sale of Practical Etiquette, a sale that has
required the issuance of a large number of editions of the little
manual, has been very gratifying to its author, as was also the
commission of its publisher to re-write and enlarge the work. This
commission, however, brought with it a keen sense of responsibility,
for the author feels that a new work on etiquette can find a _raison
d’être_ only in a fairly successful attempt at answering practically
every question that can arise concerning social relations, at least
in ordinary social life. But to speak with authority on all matters
of “good form” is to speak dogmatically, and so to speak is in itself
not good form. Nevertheless, and in spite of this dilemma, the author
has attempted herein to decide, when compelled to do so, between
conflicting opinions in mere matters of social custom, and has given
as authority the opinion that seemed to her to conform most nearly
to common sense, embodying such opinion in an unqualified statement
without citing authority. Fortunately, social customs are now so nearly
uniform in all parts of the country, that one familiar with the ways of
good society in the West or in the North, is at home in good society in
the East or in the South.

The author is under obligation to so many persons for suggestions and
advice, as well as to many authors, that it does not seem best to give
a list of the same, especially as such list could be only a partial
one, for many of her friends would not desire mention of their names.

INTRODUCTION.

  “True politeness is to do and say
   The kindest thing in the kindest way.”


If civil law is the outgrowth of regard for other people’s rights,
social law is equally the outgrowth of regard for other people’s
feelings and convenience. Social law is kindness and good-will and the
desire to be agreeable codified. A system of so much importance cannot
be unworthy of consideration.

The very essence of good manners is self-possession, and
self-possession is another name for self-forgetfulness. Gentility is
neither in birth, manner, nor fashion, but in the mind. A high sense
of honor, a determination never to take a mean advantage of another,
and an adherence to truth, delicacy, and politeness towards those
with whom one may have dealings, are the essential and distinguishing
characteristics of a gentleman.

Quietness in all things is an essential element to a well-bred person.
He shuns all outward display of his personality; he cares not to be
seen or heard; he eschews noisy and grandiloquent talk; he avoids
showy and noticeable costumes. His voice is low; his words simple; and
his actions grave. He holds himself habitually under restraint; his
words never seem to vibrate with emotion.

Habits are said to be good or bad as the result of actions that are
right or wrong. A man of good habits is one who has for so long a time
practiced right thinking, speaking, and doing, that he acts properly
from force of habit.

Good manners are not to be put on for particular occasions, like fine
clothes, but they should be one’s second nature. The simpler and more
easy and unconstrained one’s manners, the more he will impress people
with his good breeding. Affectation is one of the brazen marks of
vulgarity.

CHAPTER I.

INTRODUCTIONS, CALLS, CARDS, VISITING.

    “A beautiful behavior gives a higher pleasure than
    statues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine
    arts.”—_Emerson._


INTRODUCTIONS.

In introducing persons, one should be careful to pronounce each name
distinctly.

When either name is not perfectly understood, a repetition of it should
be requested of the person making the introduction. When introductions
are given, it is the man who should be presented to the woman; when two
women are introduced, it is the younger who is presented to the elder.
For example, in presenting Mr. Jones to Mrs. Smith, it is Mrs. Smith’s
name that is first mentioned. The word “introduce” is preferred to
“present.” Informal introductions are given by merely mentioning the
names; as, “Mrs. Smith, Mr. Jones,” and this is ordinarily sufficient.

In introducing two sisters, the elder is “Miss Smith” and the younger
“Miss Virginia Smith.”

When two women are introduced to each other, it is not necessary for
either to rise; a bow and a smile from each is sufficient.

A woman does not rise when a man is presented to her, unless he is
very old or is a person of great importance. Upon being introduced, a
married woman may offer her hand to a man but it is not customary for a
young woman to do so.

It is the duty of a man who attends a private entertainment, to have
himself presented to every member of the family whom he does not know.

An introduction in the street car is very bad form.

One should never forget that it is difficult, almost impossible, for
some people to remember names and faces, and that such people actually
suffer from their inability to recognize and call by name persons to
whom they may have been introduced recently.

It is not uncommon to see one approach such a person, offer her hand,
and say, if there is not an immediate recognition, “I am afraid you
do not remember me,” while the person approached stands in agony, and
gradually makes an apology for her poor memory, and asks the name.

One who is truly polite, who is at all thoughtful for another person’s
feelings, would not be the cause of such a scene. She would prevent it
by saying: “I am Mrs. Smith. I had the pleasure of meeting you at Mrs.
Brown’s luncheon last Thursday;” or something of the kind.

Whenever one has reason to think his name or face may have been
forgotten, he should make himself known, in approaching another person,
by giving his name at least.


CALLS.

A first call ought to be returned within a very short time.

A lady when receiving rises as her callers enter, and they immediately
advance to pay their respects to her before speaking to others.

A man takes any vacant chair, without troubling the hostess to look
after him.

A man rises when women with whom he is talking rise to take their
leave. Women calling do not rise unless those who are leaving are
friends older than themselves.

When taking leave, one ought to choose a moment when there is a lull in
the conversation, and then take leave of the hostess, letting one bow
include the others in the room.

One month after the birth of a child, a call of congratulation is made
by acquaintances.

A call of condolence is made within ten days after the death, if the
caller is on intimate terms with the family, or within a month if
otherwise.

Calls of congratulation are due to the newly married, and to the
parents who gave the invitations to the marriage.

A man invited by a woman to call upon her, cannot, without great
discourtesy, neglect to pay the call within a week.

A lady will never keep a caller waiting, without sending word that she
will be in immediately.

One ought always to return a call, but if the acquaintance is not
desirable, the first call may be the last.

Some women only rise when their callers leave, others accompany them as
far as the drawing-room door; but it is always polite for a hostess to
accompany her visitors to the front door when they take their leave,
if there is not a servant on hand to open the door for them. The best
bred hostesses even go so far as to accompany their callers to the
elevator in a hotel or an apartment-house. Of course, if one has more
than one caller at a time, it would be discourteous to leave the others
to accompany one to the door; but, otherwise, it is rude to permit a
friend to go to the door alone, and get out as best she may.

A bride who is “At Home after November first,” should make a point of
literally staying at home for an hour or two every afternoon during
the month of November and the early part of December. She should be
dressed to receive callers, and should have some dainty refreshments
ready to serve,—tea and sandwiches or cake. After the first week of
December the bride may begin to return her calls, calling first on
those who first called upon her, and so on.

When the “at home” is a large and formal function, with engraved
invitations and all the accessories of hired waiters, an elaborate
repast, floral decorations, etc.,—such as a debutante’s coming out, a
wedding reception, or a reception to celebrate a wedding anniversary,
and other large entertainments of this order,—an after-call is
obligatory. But an ordinary “at home” does not demand another call,
for instance, the reception or “days” a bride has on her return from
her wedding trip, or when she is settled in her new home; or a tea or
“days” for which a hostess informally sends the invitations written or
engraved on her visiting cards, and receives with little ceremony and
serves only a modest menu. On the contrary, the hostess owes a return
call to all who attend; and only those who were invited, but were
unable to be present, are in debt to her.

The length of time proper for one to stay at an “at home” depends
on circumstances. It is always a compliment to one’s hostess to
make a long visit at “a day”, for it implies that one is having a
pleasant time; but nobody should stay long enough to be a burden on
the hostess’s hospitality, or to detain her from her other guests. If
one finds that she does not know any one present, or if she is not
introduced to a congenial person with whom she can have a pleasant
chat, it would be wise for her to leave after a conventional ten or
fifteen minutes’ call.

The calling code demands that soon after a second caller is announced,
the caller who was first present shall take leave of the hostess. The
reason for this rule is obvious: visitor number one has already had
a little time of uninterrupted _tête-à-tête_ with the hostess before
visitor number two appeared, and he or she should generously retire
first, so that visitor number two may have the same privilege. But
while this is the law, it depends somewhat on circumstances whether it
is always carried out. If the first caller is an intimate friend of
the hostess, and has come to have a long informal talk with her, and
the second caller is merely a formal visitor whose obvious intention
is to make a ceremonious visit, then the first comer may, with perfect
propriety, outstay the other; or if the hostess has particularly asked
the former to remain until after the latter goes, he may do so, and, of
course, if the first visitor has come for some special reason, and the
visitor who is announced later interrupts an important conversation,
which, for business or other reasons, should be continued, the former
is naturally justified in transgressing the calling code. All things
being equal, however, it is the place of the first comer to be the
first goer; and one must have a very good excuse for outstaying a
caller who comes later.

Guests who are invited to attend one large reception which is given for
the express purpose of introducing a young woman into society, should
make a call after the reception, but if the _débutante_ is introduced
at a series of “days,” the callers need call but once, on one of the
“days.”

An invitation to any kind of “day” or reception demands a card from
a person who is unable to attend the function; and the card should
be sent on the day of the reception, even if the invitation to the
function has been already answered, and even if an after-call is in
order.

When one calls on an acquaintance who is staying with a relative, the
caller should ask for the latter (the hostess), even if she does not
know her, and she should leave one of her own and one of her husband’s
cards for her, as well as one of each for her friend. It is not
obligatory to leave two of her husband’s cards for each woman. Even
in the most formal visiting, it is optional whether one leaves one or
two cards. Probably the hostess will excuse herself altogether; but the
caller must show her the courtesy of asking for her.

In making a call it is proper to give one’s card to the servant who
opens the door, if it is not a regular reception day; but on such an
occasion the card should be left either in the dressing-room or on the
hall table in passing out.

In making a formal call ten minutes is quite long enough to stay.

When one is returning visits and driving, it would be in very bad taste
to have the coachman get off his box and take the card to the door. It
is the woman’s place to deliver her card in person, unless she has a
footman to attend to it for her.

In making an evening call a man should appear about half-past eight,
and remain an hour. Even if his visit is to the daughter, he should ask
for her mother.

It is quite proper, when making calls with a friend, for one to write
her name in pencil on her friend’s card, if she has no card of her own
with her.

Those women whose households are most modest find that the day “at
home” is a great convenience, since, having a special time for
receiving one’s friends, all necessary arrangements can be made
beforehand, and no embarrassing situations are apt to occur.

When one calls on a friend who lives in a flat, she should, immediately
after ringing, call through the tube her name and that of the person
she wishes to see.

A man leaves his overcoat, hat, and stick in the hall when making an
evening call; when calling in the afternoon he leaves his overcoat in
the hall, but carries his hat and stick into the drawing-room with him.

When a daughter is in the parlor, and her mother is entertaining
callers, she should rise when her mother does in bidding them good-day.

It is very improper for a young girl who is ill to receive men callers
in her room.


CARDS.

When an invitation to a reception is sent in the name of several
women, a guest should leave or send cards for all whose names are on
the invitation. A woman leaves with her own cards the cards of those
members of her family who are unable to call.

A young woman, when calling upon her friends with a young man who is a
stranger to them, should send his card with her own to the hostess and
other women of the household.

In making formal calls a visitor invariably hands her cards to the
servant who opens the door with a card tray in her hand; when calling
informally one may simply give her name to the servant at the door, but
then leaves no card later.

A married woman, when making formal calls, leaves one of her husband’s
and one of her own cards for the hostess and for every other woman she
asks for in the house, and one of her husband’s cards, besides, for
the host; but, while this is the rule for formal visiting, it is quite
permissible for a married woman, when calling on a number of women who
reside in the same house, to leave, besides her own and her husband’s
for the host and hostess, only one more of each for all the others.

In making formal visits, and subsequent calls after the first formal
visit has been made, a married woman need leave only one of her
husband’s cards with her own; and in making a call in acknowledgment of
an invitation to an entertainment to which she alone was invited,—such
as a woman’s luncheon,—she should leave only one of her own.

The fashionable visiting card varies in size; but for a married woman
it is generally pure white and very thin, with the name engraved in
ordinary script. For a woman who lives in the country, it is in good
taste to have the name of her country place put just where, if she were
in the city, her town address would be, which is in the left hand lower
corner.

If a woman receives “at home” cards for “Tuesdays in February,” and is
prevented from calling on any of the Tuesdays, she should send her card
in an envelope, either by hand or mail, on the first Tuesday, and call
on the hostess at the earliest opportunity on some other day.

A man should use a card engraved, as “Mr. George Wellington Smith,” not
omitting the prefix, with the address in one corner, if desired. The
size of the card varies from time to time, but it is smaller than a
woman’s card.

The names of mother and daughter or daughters are often engraved on one
card; as,

  .................................
  .                               .
  .      MRS. JUDSON BROWN.       .
  .       MISS ANNA BROWN.        .
  .                               .
  .................................

  ...........................
  .                         .
  .    MRS. JUDSON BROWN.   .
  .    THE MISSES BROWN.    .
  .                         .
  ...........................

The following is the usual form for an unmarried woman’s card:

  ...........................
  .                         .
  .     MISS MAY BROWN,     .
  .                         .
  .  12 PINE ST.            .
  ...........................

It is quite proper for a woman to retain her deceased husband’s name on
her visiting cards; as, “Mrs. John Smith.” It is equally proper for her
to use “Mrs. Jane Smith” for the purpose.

When a caller is met by the hostess at the door, she should drop her
card in the card receiver or leave it on the hall table on her way out.
The object of such a card is not to introduce people when visiting, but
as a reminder of the visit.

“P. P. C.” cards should be left on the occasion of a long absence (of
over three months); on leaving town at the close of the season; on
leaving a neighborhood where one has resided for years, or where one
has resided for months and sometimes only for weeks, but not when
changing houses in the same neighborhood, not even when about to be
married, unless one’s future home is to be in another city. The words
_pour prendre congé_ signify to take leave.

“R. S. V. P.” means “_Repondez s’il vous plait_,” which is the French
for “Answer, if you please.”

Turning down the corner of a visiting card, meaning that the call was
made in person, is no longer in vogue. One might leave her card in
person, writing on it “With kind inquiries,” when sickness or death has
entered the household of a friend, and thus show a delicate courtesy.

It is proper for a hostess to shake hands with a man visitor on his
arrival and at his departure.

It is an evidence of very bad taste for a young woman to send wedding
cards to a married man without including his wife’s name, even if she
has no acquaintance whatever with her.

A young girl who is not “out” does not have visiting cards. If she is
the oldest or only daughter and is in society, her cards have upon them
“Miss Smith.”

A woman should never ask a man formally calling to take his hat, or a
woman to lay aside her wraps.

A card sent to an afternoon reception represents one’s self. It should
be sent either by mail or messenger, and never by a friend to deposit
upon the receiver with her own card.


VISITING.

A guest should always ascertain what are the usual hours of rising,
taking meals, and retiring, and then conform scrupulously to them.

Guests should give as little trouble as possible, and never apologize
for the extra trouble their visit necessarily occasions.

If a ride, drive, or walk is proposed by one of the family
entertaining, a guest should acquiesce as far as her strength will
allow, and do all in her power to seem pleased by the efforts made for
her entertainment.

Upon taking one’s departure, it is expected—and reasonably, too—that
some acknowledgment be made of the pleasure that has been afforded one.

It is also proper upon returning home to inform the friends just left
of one’s safe arrival.




CHAPTER II.

NOTES OF INVITATION, ANNOUNCEMENT CARDS, WEDDING INVITATIONS,
ACCEPTANCES AND REGRETS, LETTERS, LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.

    “Politeness is one of those advantages which we never
    estimate rightly, but by the inconvenience of its
    loss.”—_Samuel Johnson._


NOTES OF INVITATION.

Notes of invitation for evening parties are issued in the name of the
lady of the house; as,

_Mrs. James Little requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. George White’s
company on Monday evening, March seventeenth, from nine to twelve
o’clock._[A]

The expression “presents compliments” is obsolete, as is also the
term “polite,” which was formerly used in acceptances or regrets. The
English form of “kind” or “very kind” is now substituted in its place.

A very acceptable form of invitation for a mother (if the mother is not
living, the father’s name may be so used) and daughter is this:

_Mrs. and Miss Graves at Home, Thursday, October twenty-seventh, from
eight to eleven o’clock._

When a very large dinner party is to be given, the invitations should
be issued at least two weeks in advance; and if some very celebrated
people are to be invited, twenty-one days should elapse between sending
out the invitations and the day of the function. For a small affair ten
days’ notice is sufficient. Invitations to large teas should be sent
out fourteen days in advance, but for small ones a week’s notice is
sufficient.

In answering an invitation sent out in the name of both mother and
daughter, one should address the mother.

When sending out invitations to evening parties, it is customary to
denote the amusement feature, if there is to be one, by naming it
in the lower left hand corner; as, “Dancing,” or “Cards,” or “Fancy
dress and masks.” The hour is designated thus: “Dancing after nine,”
or “German at eight o’clock,” or “Supper at half after seven,” and
underneath “Dancing.” Sometimes a separate card is enclosed, reading
“Dancing at nine o’clock.”

    _Mrs. George Brown requests the pleasure of Miss Lee’s
    company on Tuesday evening, January seventh, at nine
    o’clock._

  _Dancing._                       _221 Thirty-fifth Street._

The correct form of invitation for an entertainment where an
elocutionist is to be the principal feature is worded as follows:

    _Mrs. James Smith requests the pleasure of Mr. and
    Mrs. Brown’s company on Thursday evening, December the
    first, at eight o’clock._

                                      _124 Jewell Avenue._

    _Reading by Professor William White._

An invitation to a rose or lawn party might read thus:

              MRS. JAMES SMITH.
              THE MISSES SMITH.
                    AT HOME
  TUESDAY EVENING, JUNE THE TWENTY-EIGHTH,
              AT EIGHT O’CLOCK.

     ROSE PARTY                 TO MEET
  212 SHERIDAN AVENUE.      THE MISSES WHITE.

In writing invitations for a club for which one is acting as secretary
it would be wise to put them in the third person, and then there would
be no embarrassment about the arrangement of names.

The words “reception” and “at home” are synonymous. Each means an
entertainment which takes place between certain stated hours in the
afternoon or evening, where refreshments are served, and no especial
order of amusement is provided, unless it is specified in the
invitations. To a “reception” or “at home” the hostess generally sends
invitations to all on her calling list. These large functions are
usually given for some especial purpose; as, to introduce a _débutante_
into society, to celebrate a wedding anniversary, or for the bride and
groom after the wedding ceremony, or merely that the hostess may meet
all her friends.

There is, however, a decided distinction between a reception or an “at
home” and a tea or “days.” An invitation to the first is engraved on a
sheet of note paper or a large sized card, and is formally worded. The
hours for the afternoon function are usually from four until seven,
and one may expect to find at the house or place of entertainment
decorations of flowers and greens, and quite an elaborate repast
provided; but an invitation to a tea or to “days” does not imply that
anything but the simplest kind of menu will be served, nor that any
but simple preparations will be made. The invitations to the latter
entertainments may be the hostess’s visiting cards with the address
and “tea at four o’clock” written in one corner; or if the hostess
prefers to receive informally on more than one day, she may have the
form “Fridays,” or “Fridays in February,” or “First and third Fridays
in February,” or whatever days she chooses, written or engraved on her
cards.

The formal luncheon hour is from one to two o’clock. Afternoon teas are
usually at five. One’s visiting card can be used only for an invitation
for an afternoon “at home;” invitations to dinner or luncheon must be
written out. In sending out cards for a tea one should simply write the
date and the hour in the lower left-hand corner; in sending a note,
whether by messenger or post, the number of the house and the name of
the street should be written out in full.

The following is a good form of invitation to an “at home” given by
several women:

       MRS. JAMES SMITH
      MRS. CHARLES WHITE
     MRS. FREDERICK BROWN
            AT HOME
  SATURDAY, APRIL THE SIXTEENTH
       AT FOUR O’CLOCK
             112 MADISON STREET

The usual form of an invitation to a luncheon is as follows:

          MRS. JAMES BROWN
  REQUESTS THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY
             AT LUNCHEON
     ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL THE SIXTH,
           AT ONE O’CLOCK.

Below this and to the right would be the address, and the date on which
the invitation is written.

The invitation for a musical may be worded as follows:

    _Mrs. James Smith requests the pleasure of Miss Brown’s
    company on Friday afternoon, March seventeenth, at two
    o’clock._

     _Music._
    _R.S.V.P._                          _24 Queen Avenue._


ANNOUNCEMENT CARDS.

The simplest way to announce an engagement is for each of the engaged
couple to write short notes of announcement on the same day to each
one’s relatives and near friends. All these notes are sent so that they
will be received at the same time. They are written in the first person
on dainty note paper, and the best form is the simplest. The character
of the note must depend on the intimacy between the writer and the
recipient.

A pretty and fashionable sequence to the announcement is for the bride
to give a tea for the express purpose of receiving congratulations.
She may mention it in her notes of announcement, and her _fiancé_ may
mention in his notes that she will be at home on a certain day at a
certain hour. She should then receive with her mother or some older
relative, and she should have some light refreshment provided for her
callers. All her young friends will call, and all the relatives and
near friends of her _fiancé_. The _fiancé_ should be present at the
tea, or he may come before it is over, but he should not formally
receive with his betrothed.

Engagements are often announced in the newspapers.

Wedding announcements or invitations should be sent in envelopes
addressed to the father and mother of the family, to the daughter or
daughters (addressed as the Misses), and to each of the grown sons.
All these invitations in their envelopes may be enclosed in an outside
envelope addressed to the parents.

A wedding invitation or announcement card should always be addressed to
both members of a married couple, even if the bride or groom who sends
it is acquainted with only one.

The correct form for wedding announcement cards is as follows:

         MR. AND MRS. JOHN SMITH
  ANNOUNCE THE MARRIAGE OF THEIR DAUGHTER,
                  ANNA
                   TO
              MR. FRANK BROWN
  ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER THE TWENTY-SECOND,
     EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE.
             WASHINGTON, D. C.

The bride’s “at home” cards should be separate, but enclosed with the
announcements, and should read as follows:

            AT HOME
  TUESDAY AFTERNOONS IN JANUARY.
    125 WEST FIFTEENTH STREET,
         NEW YORK CITY.

Announcement cards should be sent out immediately after the wedding
to every one on the bride’s and groom’s list. And, again, wedding
announcement cards need not be sent out in any one’s name. The
following is an example:

                MARRIED
  ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY THE EIGHTEENTH,
     EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE
          AT ST. THOMAS’ CHURCH
               NEW YORK,
          MARGARET BAKER WHITE
                  TO
             WILLIAM BARTON.

When a bride is an orphan it is customary for the cards announcing her
wedding to be sent in the name of one of her near relatives, or else
they may read simply like the one given above.

Wedding announcement cards demand no acknowledgment from an
acquaintance of the bride who lives at a distance, unless a “day” or
“days” are mentioned on them, when it is obligatory to send visiting
cards on the “day” or the first one of the “days;” otherwise, if one
wishes to be particularly polite, one may send a visiting-card in
acknowledgment of the announcement, but it is not obligatory to do so.

Wedding announcements are sent to friends at home as well as to
those abroad, because the cards are supposed, not only to suggest
remembrance, but to express a desire that the acquaintance should be
continued after the name is changed.

The birth of a baby is announced in various ways, there being no
especial rules of etiquette for making the announcement. Sometimes
engraved cards bearing the baby’s name and date of birth are sent by
themselves in small envelopes, into which they fit exactly; sometimes
they go in an envelope with the mother’s visiting-card, and are written
instead of engraved. These cards should be attached to the mother’s
visiting cards by a piece of white baby ribbon, which is passed
through a hole made in the top of both cards and tied in a tiny bow.
They should be sent out when the mother is ready to receive calls.


WEDDING INVITATIONS.

Wedding invitations should be issued at least two weeks before the day
of the affair.

It is customary for the bridegroom to give to the bride’s mother a list
of his relatives and friends to whom he would like cards sent, and some
member of the bride’s family attends to it.

When the guests at a wedding are limited to the immediate family, the
invitations may be personal notes sent by the bride’s mother. The notes
may read like the following:

    _My Dear Mary,—It will give us all much pleasure if
    you will come to the very quiet wedding of my daughter
    Catherine to Mr. John Martin, on Saturday, February the
    fourth, at twelve o’clock, and remain to the little
    breakfast that will follow the ceremony. Only the
    members of the family will be present. Hoping that you
    may be with us the fourth, I am,_

                      _Affectionately yours,
                                      Anna Brown._

A formal invitation may read as follows:

        MR. AND MRS. JAMES M. MOORE
  REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR PRESENCE AT
       THE MARRIAGE OF THEIR DAUGHTER
                    ALICE
                     TO
           CHARLES ALBERT SMITH,
  THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST TWENTY-FOURTH,
             AT EIGHT O’CLOCK,
          121 SEVENTH STREET EAST,
             DAVENPORT, IOWA,
                   1899.

Another form is as follows:

        MR. AND MRS. JOHN BROWN
  REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR PRESENCE
                AT THE
  MARRIAGE BREAKFAST OF THEIR DAUGHTER
             MARY LOUISE
                 AND
       MR. CHARLES ALBERT SMITH,
    ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER THE SIXTH,
     FROM ONE UNTIL THREE O’CLOCK.
                     15 PROSPECT STREET.

If the bride is an orphan, or if there is any very good reason why her
parents’ names should not appear on the invitation, the latter may be
sent in the name of the married brother and his wife, or in the name of
whoever gives the bride the wedding reception. It may read as follows:

     MR. AND MRS. CHARLES SMITH
  REQUEST THE HONOR OF YOUR PRESENCE
   AT THE MARRIAGE OF THEIR SISTER
            BERTHA WILD
                TO
     MR. JAMES MONTGOMERY BROWN,
  ON WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER THE TWELFTH,
         AT EIGHT O’CLOCK.
     2400 FIFTH STREET SOUTH.

The following is a suitable form for an invitation for a silver wedding:

          TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY.
         MR. AND MRS. JOHN H. SMITH
                  AT HOME
  SATURDAY EV’G, DECEMBER TWENTY-SEVENTH,
       EIGHTEEN HUNDRED NINETY NINE,
       FROM EIGHT TO ELEVEN O’CLOCK.


ACCEPTANCES AND REGRETS.

It is considered very rude not to reply to an invitation immediately,
either by note of acceptance or regret.

In writing acceptances one should never use “will accept” for
“accepts,” or “to dinner” instead of “for dinner” or “to dine.”

In accepting a dinner invitation one should repeat the hour named in
order that, if any mistake has been made, it may be corrected.

An acceptance may be written as follows:

_Mr. and Mrs. Frank Warren accept with pleasure Mrs. John Somers’ kind
invitation for Monday evening, October seventh._

The following is a good form for a note of regret:

_Mr. and Mrs. James Swift regret that, owing to sickness, they are
unable to accept Mrs. Frank Hall’s kind invitation for Monday evening,
March 16th._

In writing regrets, when it is possible to do so, one should give the
reason for not accepting an invitation.

The best bred people agree that an invitation to a wedding reception
or a wedding breakfast demands a response, whether or not a response
is requested. But it is another question when one receives only an
invitation to a church ceremony, or merely an announcement card with
no “at home” card enclosed, and does not know the bride and groom well
enough to call. If the cards are sent merely as a matter of courtesy
because of business relations or on account of a former intimacy in the
families, a call does not seem necessary. In such cases one must judge
more or less for herself, and do what seems natural. If one lives in a
small place and the bride comes there as a stranger, it is generally
the best way to call, whatever be the form of the cards received.

Formal invitations to a church wedding do not demand an answer, unless
one is requested, until the day of the ceremony, when those unable to
attend acknowledge the invitation with visiting cards addressed to the
father and mother of the bride, or to whoever sends out the invitations
for the wedding. Invitations to a wedding reception and a bride’s “At
Home” demand no other acknowledgment than visiting cards sent on the
day of the function by those unable to attend. A formal invitation to
a house wedding demands the same acknowledgment as an invitation to a
church wedding.

In acknowledging an invitation to a wedding, a single woman sends
one of her visiting cards in an envelope addressed to the mother and
father of the bride on the day of the wedding. A single man sends two
of his cards, and a married couple send one of the wife’s and two of
the husband’s cards. To the bride on her “At Home” day, cards should be
sent in exactly the same way. A wedding reception, if it takes place in
the evening, demands full dress.

It is very courteous to acknowledge the reception of a “commencement”
invitation.

It is very bad form to write “Congratulations” on one’s visiting card
and send it in answer to a wedding invitation. If one desires to send
her good wishes to the bride, then a personal note would be proper.

It is also bad form to send a visiting card with “Regrets” written in
one corner instead of writing the proper note.

If, having accepted an invitation, one changes her mind, she certainly
ought to give some reason when writing a note of apology.


LETTERS.

In writing letters and notes of invitation, acceptance, regrets, or
introduction, certain and specific rules of etiquette, ordained by
custom, hold despotic sway; and unless one is acquainted with these, he
must be considered by those who are, as more or less uncultivated.

In addressing an envelope one surely ought to know that the first line
of the address should be at or below the middle of the envelope, and
the address should be written in a plain hand devoid of flourishes. The
place for the stamp is always the upper right-hand corner.

In no way is one’s culture sooner made known than by his manner of
writing a note or letter.

In a formal business letter or in one commencing “Dear Sir” or “Dear
Madam,” the name of the person addressed is put at the end of the
letter in the left-hand corner, but it should not be repeated, if it is
used at the head of the letter.

The writing of notes in the third person is now confined to notes of
invitations, acceptance, and regret.

Nothing would show greater ignorance than signing one’s name to a note
written in the third person.

In addressing a clergyman it is customary to commence with “Reverend
Sir.” Doctors of Divinity and of Medicine are thus distinguished: “The
Rev. James Swift, D. D.,” or “Rev. Dr. Swift;” “I. G. Latham, M. D.,”
or “Dr. Latham.”

In writing to servants, it is customary to begin thus: “To Mary
Bates,—Mrs. White wishes, etc.”

When a woman is writing to strangers who will not know whether to
address her in reply as “Mrs.” or “Miss,” the address of the writer
should be given in full, after signing her letter, as, “Mrs. Jane
Smith,” followed by the direction; or, if unmarried, the “Miss” should
be placed in marks of parenthesis preceding the signature. One should
never sign her name as “Mrs.” or “Miss.”

The formal manner of address in a note or letter written in the
first person, is, “My Dear Mrs. Brown;” the less formal is “Dear
Mrs. Brown.” To an intimate friend one may use either. “Dear Mary”
is less formal than “My Dear Mary,” and yet to one who is near,
the real significance of the latter form is very sweet and full of
tender meaning. However, there are no rigid laws to regulate the
correspondence of friends.

When a woman writes a personal note to a man, no matter how slight her
acquaintance may be with him, it should begin “My Dear Mr. Brown.”

Ordinary social correspondence, when forwarded by the hand of an adult
socially equal with the sender, should not be sealed. If, for some
reason, a letter must be sealed, then the post or some other method of
letter conveyance should be used.

The form “Addressed” on an envelope is merely the relic of an old legal
form that has no especial significance nowadays, but is put on the
envelope as a matter of courtesy. It means that the contents of the
envelope are for the person whose name is written on the outside. It is
very seldom used, and is quite superfluous.

Only letters of unmarried women and widows are addressed with their
baptismal names. All letters of married women should bear their
husband’s names; as, “Mrs. John Howe.”

Writing on the first, then on the third, then crosswise on the second
and fourth pages of a letter, facilitates the reading and is in
perfectly good form.

It is very bad taste for a doctor’s wife to assume his title. An
invitation addressed to them should read “Dr. and Mrs. Jones.”

One should not write “Mrs. John Brown, _née_ Lottie Smith,” because one
is not born with a Christian name; instead, one would write “Mrs. John
Brown, _née_ Smith.”

The use of perfumed stationery is not general, nor is it in good taste.

Any letter of congratulation received, even though it be from a person
with whom one has only a slight acquaintance, requires an answer.

No matter how fond a young girl may feel of a man whom she has known
for years, any letters, when trouble comes to his family, should be
addressed to his wife and not to him.

The fashion that obtains with reference to placing the date on a letter
is to place it in the upper right-hand corner; on a note it is usually
placed in the lower left-hand corner.

A young girl who receives letters from a man at the post-office without
the knowledge of her mother is doing something wrong, which in time
she will certainly regret, and which, it is equally certain, will
result in trouble.

It is not in the best taste to write letters of friendship on the
typewriter, but it will always be excused in the busy woman.


LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.

Letters of introduction are to be regarded as certificates of
respectability and esteem, and should only be given by friends of the
person introduced and to friends. They should be brief and carefully
worded, intimating the mutual pleasure that one feels the acquaintance
will confer, but not complimenting the bearer so openly that he will
feel embarrassed in delivering the letter. Such letters are left
unsealed.

There is no greater insult than to treat a letter of introduction with
indifference. A person thus introduced ought to be called upon at once,
and shown any other little attention within one’s power. In England
letters of introduction are called “tickets to soup.”

In England the party holding a letter of introduction never takes it
himself, but sends it with his card. On the Continent the reverse is
the fashion. In America the English custom prevails, though where a
young man has a letter to one many years his senior or to one who is
to aid him in some enterprise, he takes it himself at once.

A letter of introduction should be somewhat like the following:

   _My Dear Mr. Barnes:_

    _This note will introduce to you my friend, Mr. Charles
    Smith, whom I know you will be as glad to meet as he
    will be glad to meet you._

    _Mr. Smith is an old friend of mine, and any kindness
    you may be able to show him will be very much
    appreciated by me._

                             _Faithfully yours,_
                                     _Anna Martin White._

Before giving a letter of introduction one should be certain that the
persons introduced will be congenial to each other. Such a letter
puts a certain obligation on the person to whom it is addressed: he
will be obliged to show the bearer some attention and hospitality. It
is, therefore, not right to make the demand of a friend unless one is
certain that the acquaintanceship will compensate him for the trouble
he may take.

CHAPTER III.

DINNERS, LUNCHEONS, BREAKFASTS, TEAS, RECEPTIONS, DANCING PARTIES,
CARDS, PARTIES, WEDDINGS, WEDDING GIFTS, WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.

    “Manners aim to facilitate life, to get rid of
    impediments.”


DINNERS.[B]

A “dinner” is supposed to be an elaborate affair, with numerous courses
and ample service, and is usually given at seven or eight o’clock
in the evening. At a dinner the number of courses naturally varies
according to the taste and financial condition of the hostess. (For
arrangement of the table, see Chapter VI.)

For a formal dinner the courses usually consist of soup, fish, a roast
with one or more vegetables, a salad, an ice or ice cream, cakes,
bonbons, and black coffee. Olives and salted almonds, jellies, etc.,
generally appear in some of the courses.

Although the following really belongs under the head of “The Table” and
“Service at Table,” a repetition here may not come amiss.

The attendant places each dish, in succession, before the host or
hostess with the pile of plates. Each plate is supplied, taken by the
attendant on a small salver, and set, from the left, before the guest.
A second dish which belongs to the course is presented at the left of
the guest, who helps himself. As a rule the woman at the right of the
host, or the eldest woman, should be served first. As soon as a course
is finished, the plates are promptly removed, and the next course is
served in the same way. Before the dessert is brought on, all crumbs
should be brushed from the cloth. The finger bowls, which are brought
in on a napkin on a dessert-plate and set at the left of the plate, are
used by dipping the fingers in lightly and drying them on the napkin.
They should be half full of warm water with a bit of lemon floating in
it. When all have finished dessert, the hostess gives the signal, by
pushing back her chair, that dinner is ended, and the guests repair to
the drawing-room, the oldest leading and the youngest following last,
the men passing into the library or smoking-room.

Seemingly, one should arrive at the house where one is invited to a
dinner or a luncheon at exactly the hour mentioned in the invitation;
but the proper thing at a formal function is to get to the house
ten minutes after the hour of the meal, and to be announced in the
drawing-room five minutes later.

The host, with the guest of honor, leads the way into the dining-room
at a dinner; at a luncheon the hostess leads the way alone or with one
of the guests.

Fifteen minutes is the longest time required to wait for a tardy guest
when the dinner hour was understood, as it always should be.

If the hostess thinks the visitor has no acquaintances in the room,
she introduces her to two or three persons who are near her, and then,
counting on her knowledge of the customs of society, she will feel
quite sure that her guest will enjoy herself.

A hostess should never reprove a servant before a guest, as it is
unpleasant for all concerned, and by passing over the annoyance
herself, it may escape the attention of others.

No accident must seem to disturb a hostess, no disappointment embarrass
her.

At formal dinner parties the servant who is detailed to attend
to the wants of the men guests hands each one, as he leaves the
dressing-room, an envelope containing a card bearing the name of the
woman whom he is to take to dinner.


LUNCHEONS.

Luncheons are usually given between the hours of one and two o’clock in
the afternoon, and to them women only are invited. The menu is lighter
than for a dinner, and generally consists of sherbets, oyster patties,
scalloped oysters, sweet-breads, sandwiches, salads, ices, cheese
sticks, fruit, ice cream, cakes, bonbons, salted almonds, olives, and
black coffee, served in such number and order of courses as best suits
the hostess.


BREAKFASTS.

The difference between a breakfast and a luncheon is very slight. On
the invitation the word breakfast is used instead of luncheon, and
the hour is earlier than for a luncheon. Also men and woman may meet
together for a breakfast, and therefore a few more solid courses
are advisable. Otherwise one may be guided entirely in giving the
entertainment by the rules which apply to a luncheon.


TEAS.

A tea is the simplest and easiest kind of an entertainment to give, for
the only essential requisites for its success are prettily arranged
receiving-rooms, with as many flowers as one can afford; a gracious
hostess, who stands during the hours of the function to receive her
guests and is properly dressed in a becoming high-necked house dress;
a few other women, who also receive in pretty dresses; and a dainty
tea table, which may be presided over by a woman friend or two of the
hostess. It is only necessary to serve a modest menu of tea, chocolate
or bouillon, assorted sandwiches, fancy cakes, and bonbons. The other
factors to the tea’s success are pleasant weather and well trained
servants, who may assist in serving the tea and are alert to open and
close the door for the guests.

At a formal function of any kind the guests leave their wraps in
dressing-rooms, where one or more maids should be on hand to assist
women in their dressing-room, and a man to perform the same services
in the men’s dressing-room; but at a small tea, where, as a rule, the
guests do not remove their street wraps, it is only necessary to have a
maid in the entrance hall to be ready, if called on, to do any service.

It is not customary to offer refreshments to casual evening callers;
but if one has a regular evening for receiving, she may have a tea
table in the drawing-room, and serve tea, chocolate, sandwiches, cake,
etc., as in entertaining on the afternoon of a “day.”


RECEPTIONS.

On the day of the reception, the hostess, with her assistants, should
receive the guests, standing at the door of the drawing-room. The
refreshment tables should be spread in the dining-room, and prettily
decorated with flowers, candles in candelabra or candlesticks, dishes
of bonbons and cakes, plates of sandwiches, and platters of salad. A
bouillon urn may stand at one end of the table with cups, and coffee
may be served from the other end. All that is necessary for the menu
is bouillon, easily prepared in the house from canned bouillon,
jellied tongue, chicken salad, and sandwiches, ices and cake, fruit,
and candies. Coffee and lemonade will suffice for beverages. If one
can afford to have a few pieces of music, so much the better. The
musicians should play from some hidden nook. One or two servants in the
dining-room, and one to open and shut the front door, will be all that
is necessary.


DANCING PARTIES.

For the form of invitation refer to Chapter II.

In selecting a company for a dancing party the hostess will naturally
choose only those who dance, and she should see, as far as possible,
that all the women are provided with partners.

It is better to dance first with one acquaintance and then with
another, rather than to make one’s self conspicuous by giving a great
number of dances to one man.

A man gives the first and last dances to his partner of the evening.

No man should invite a young woman to attend a dress affair without
providing a carriage for her. When the party is small and informal, it
is allowable to go on the street-cars.

At the end of the dance, the man should offer his arm to his partner,
and take at least one turn around the room before consigning her to her
seat.

A man who can dance, and will not, ought to remain away from a ball.

If for any reason a girl should refuse to dance with one man, she
should not accept another invitation for the same dance.

An invitation to a ball may be asked for a friend who is a stranger in
town, and has had no opportunity of making the acquaintance of the one
who gives the ball.

A man should not ask a girl, to whom he has been introduced for the
purpose of dancing with her, for more than two dances the same evening.


CARD PARTIES.

If given, prizes should be carefully chosen, so that they may be in
good taste and desirable. The supper should be served at the card
tables after the playing is over. A large napkin should be spread on
the top of each table, and the refreshments served in courses.


WEDDINGS.

For invitation forms see Chapter II.

When a wedding takes place in a church that has but one entrance, the
customary way for the bridal procession to enter is for the groom and
best man to walk in just behind the minister, a little before the
others, and to take their places at the altar; then the ushers enter,
walking two by two; then the bridesmaids in the same order; then the
maid of honor alone; and last the bride on her father’s arm. The
bride’s family enter the church a few minutes before the minister and
the groom and bridal party.

A bride goes up to the altar with her veil over her face, but comes
down with it thrown back. It is the duty of the maid of honor to throw
it back immediately after the ceremony is ended.

When the bride’s mother gives her away at a church ceremony, she
usually walks up the aisle with the bride. After she has given her to
the groom, she steps quietly and unescorted to the front pew, where she
stays during the remainder of the service. The bride may walk up the
aisle with an attendant instead of with her mother, who in this case
steps from her seat in the front pew to the chancel when the time comes
for her to officiate, and steps back to her seat afterwards.

The bride and the groom should stand at the wedding reception until
they have received the congratulations of all present, then, together,
they should walk into the room where the breakfast is to be served. The
others follow as they please, with the exception of the parents on both
sides. The groom’s father usually escorts the bride’s mother, and _vice
versa_.

It is not the custom for a bride to remove her gloves at the wedding.
The inside seam of the ring finger of the glove should be ripped
beforehand; and when the time comes for the ring to be put on, the
bride merely slips off this glove finger, and puts it back again after
the ring is on her finger.

At no wedding service is it proper for the bride to enter the church
alone.

At a church or house wedding where the bride walks up the aisle with
her sister acting as the maid of honor, instead of with a gentleman
escort, she need not take the arm of her attendant, as both the ladies
will look more graceful if walking separately. The maid of honor should
carry a bouquet, and the bride a bouquet, prayer-book, or bible.

At a home wedding the bride enters the room on the arm of her father.
With a short dress she would not wear a veil.

The wearing of gloves at an informal wedding is entirely a matter of
taste. Recently at several large weddings they were omitted by the
entire bridal party.

The prettiest way to make an aisle for the bridal party at a house
wedding is for four children to enter the room where the ceremony will
be, just before the bridal party comes in, and separate the guests
into two groups by stretching two pieces of white ribbon the length
of the room. A child stands at each end of the two pieces of ribbon,
holding it while the bridal party walks up between them, and during the
service. Ushers may hold the ribbons instead of the children, or the
ends may be fastened around plants which are placed at the requisite
points.

Where there is no side door through which the groom and best man may
enter the room at a house wedding, they come in by the principal door
just before the bridal party and just after the minister.

It is not customary for the men at a wedding party to kiss the bride;
that is a liberty taken only by the immediate members of the family.

A bride, if she wishes, may omit the bridal veil, but she should then
wear a dainty bonnet or picture hat. The ushers and best men are
invited by the bridegroom.

If the church wedding is a full dress one, followed by an evening
reception, it is proper to wear an evening gown. If it is in the
daytime, a handsome visiting dress and pretty bonnet are proper.

At a daytime wedding the guests seldom remove their bonnets, although,
of course, heavy wraps are frequently laid aside. At an evening affair
one goes in full dress without anything on one’s head. The ushers
present the guests to the bridal party. The bridesmaids are spoken to
by the people they know, but it is not necessary that they should be
addressed by everybody.

A bride may wear her wedding dress after her wedding day as much
or as little as she chooses. For the sake of sentiment many brides
like to preserve their wedding dresses intact to hand down to future
generations; but a girl who has to consider economy cannot afford to
consider sentiment, and often the wedding dress is converted into a
low dinner and evening gown soon after the wedding day. A bride may,
with perfect propriety, wear her wedding dress to the reception given
her after her wedding by the groom’s mother. Of course, she will wear
it just as it was when she was married, high in the neck, unless the
reception takes place in the evening and demands evening dress, when,
according to the conventions, it must be cut low.

A bridegroom is always expected to furnish the bouquets that the bride,
bridesmaids, and all the bride’s attendants carry at the wedding. He
should learn from the bride the flowers she wishes, and should order
them several days before the wedding, so that they may be ready at the
bride’s house when the bridesmaids meet there to go together to the
church or to the place where the ceremony is held.

Besides furnishing these bouquets, the groom provides the ushers and
best men with their _boutonnières_, and gives them also some small
souvenir, and, if he wishes, a bachelor dinner or supper a day or two
before the wedding.

There are no wedding luncheons nowadays. Every entertainment of the
kind up to two o’clock is called a breakfast, and when it takes place
in the afternoon or evening it is called a reception.


WEDDING GIFTS.

The idea that a wedding invitation necessitates a present has,
sensibly enough, gone out of fashion, and only those who are bound by
ties of blood or close friendship have the privilege of sending a gift
to the bride.

Presents should be sent as soon after receiving the invitations as
possible. All wedding gifts, even from friends of the groom who may
never have met the bride, are sent to the bride; and, if marked, they
should be engraved with the initials or monogram of the bride’s maiden
name, or they may have her name in full.

Wedding presents should be acknowledged by the bride-elect in a short
personal note, which should be written and sent immediately on receipt
of the present.

When several friends combine in giving a present to the bride, she
should write a letter of thanks to each one separately, sending the
letters by post.

It is perfectly proper to open a gift in the presence of the giver, and
express one’s pleasure and gratitude on the spot. Indeed, it is much
better form to do so than to wait until the giver has gone.


WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.

The paper wedding, so termed, is celebrated one year after marriage.
Invitations should be issued on heavy gray paper or thin card-board.
Presents may consist of any article made of paper or _papier mâché_;
such, for instance, as books, engravings, etc.

The wooden wedding is celebrated five years after marriage. Invitations
may be issued upon wooden cards, or wooden cards may be inclosed with
an invitation written or engraved upon a sheet of wedding note paper.
The presents may be anything made of wood, from a mustard spoon to a
house or set of furniture.

The tin wedding comes ten years after marriage. Invitation cards are
sometimes covered with tin foil, or tin cards are inclosed, or, if
preferred, the invitation is printed on tin bronze paper. Presents
should consist of articles made of tin.

The crystal wedding, fifteen years after marriage, is next in order.
Cards may be issued upon transparent paper, or upon note paper with a
card of isinglass inclosed.

The china wedding takes place twenty years after marriage.
Semi-transparent cardboard will answer for the invitations.

The silver wedding is celebrated on the twenty-fifth anniversary,
and is generally an occasion of much more importance than any of the
foregoing anniversaries. The invitations may be printed on silver
paper, and the presents are, of course, articles of silver.

The golden wedding, celebrated on the fiftieth anniversary of the
marriage, may be said to be the one in which the young do homage to
the old. It should be conducted by the near relatives or friends of
the couple, and the occasion should be made one of retrospect, of
encouragement, and of congratulation. The invitations should be on
white paper in gold letters, and the presents should be of gold.

At each of these anniversaries it is customary to have the marriage
ceremony re-performed, and all arrangements for the celebration are
made in about the same manner as for the first marriage.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote B: In looking up any one point in this book,—as “dinners,”
for instance,—one will be obliged sometimes to refer to more than one
place. Chapter II., under “Notes of Invitation,” and Chapter I., under
its three different heads, contain more or less information concerning
“dinners,” which it seems difficult to classify anymore closely than
has been done.]




CHAPTER IV.

CONVERSATION, CHAPERONAGE, MARRIAGE, DOMESTIC ETIQUETTE AND DUTIES.

    “Manners are not idle, but are the fruit of noble
    natures and of loyal minds.”


CONVERSATION.

The late Dr. George Ripley was wont to say that the secret of being
agreeable in conversation was to be honorable to the ideas of others.
He affirmed that some people only half listened to you, because they
were considering, even while you spoke, with what fine words, what
wealth of wit, they should reply, and they began to speak almost before
your sentence had died upon your lips. These people, he said, might
be brilliant, witty, dazzling, but never could they be agreeable. You
do not love to talk to them. You feel that they are impatient for
their turn to come, and that they have no hospitality towards your
thoughts—none of that gentle friendliness which asks your idea and
makes much of it. This want of hospitality to other people’s ideas
often has its root in egotism, but it is equally apt to be the growth
of a secret want of self-confidence, a fear that one will not be ready
to take one’s own part well,—an uneasy self-consciousness which makes
real sympathetic attention to the ideas of others impossible.

Agreeability, readiness in conversation, tact and graciousness of
manner are great aids to popularity. To possess these qualities one
must have marked consideration for others, and be ever ready to
manifest it. One should also be ready to recall faces and names.

Though one has but few facts and ideas to draw upon, she may still,
by making sufficient effort, become a fair conversationalist. If one
despair in this direction, she may at least train herself to become an
interesting listener, and she will be surprised to find how popular she
will be; for three-quarters of the world like to talk, while to listen
intelligently is a great talent. The good listener, by her evident
interest in, and sympathetic attention to, the matter of conversation,
brings out all that is best in the one with whom she talks. Diffident
people forget their shyness in her presence, and leave her with the
comfortable and novel conviction that they have, after all, acquitted
themselves rather well.

No well-bred person would be guilty of the gross rudeness of picking
up a book or magazine and “looking through” it while pretending to
pay heed to the talk of a friend. The assurance, “I am only looking at
the pictures of this magazine, not reading, and I hear every word you
say,” is no palliation of the offence. The speaker would be justified
in refusing to continue the conversation until the pictures had been
properly studied. If a speech is worth hearing, it is worthy of
respectful and earnest attention.

No one should ever monopolize the conversation, unless he wishes to win
for himself the name of a bore.

A well-educated and finely cultured person proclaims himself by the
simplicity and terseness of his language.

In conversation all provincialisms, affectations of foreign accents,
mannerisms, exaggerations, and slang are detestable.

Flippancy is as much an evidence of ill-breeding as is the perpetual
smile, the wandering eye, the vacant stare, or the half-open mouth of
the man who is preparing to break in upon the conversation.

Interruption of the speech of others is a great sin against good
breeding.

Anecdotes should be sparsely introduced into a conversation, lest they
become stale. Repartee must be indulged in with moderation. Puns are
considered vulgar by many.

In addressing persons with titles, one ought always to add the name;
as, “What do you think, Doctor Graves?” not, “What do you think,
Doctor?”

The great secret of talking well is to adapt one’s conversation
skillfully to the hearers.

In a _tête-à-tête_ conversation, it is extremely ill-bred to drop the
voice to a whisper, or to converse on private matters.

One should never try to hide the lips in talking by putting up the hand
or a fan.

One should avoid long conversations in society with members of his own
family.

If an unfinished conversation is continued after the entrance of a
visitor, its import should be explained to him.

Though bores find their account in speaking ill or well of themselves,
it is the characteristic of a gentleman that he never speaks of himself
at all. La Buryere says: “The great charm of conversation consists less
in the display of one’s own wit and intelligence than in the power to
draw forth the resources of others; he who leaves one after a long
conversation, pleased with himself and the part _he_ has taken in the
discourse, will be the other’s warmest admirer.”

In society the absent-minded man is uncivil.

There are many persons who commence speaking before they know what
they are going to say. The ill-natured world, which never misses an
opportunity of being severe, declares them to be foolish and destitute
of brains.

He who knows the world, will not be too bashful; he who knows himself,
will not be imprudent.

There is no surer sign of vulgarity than the perpetual boasting of fine
things at home.

One should be careful how freely he offers advice.

If one keeps silent sometimes upon subjects of which he is known to be
a judge, his silence, when from ignorance, will not discover him.

One should not argue a point when it is possible to avoid it, but when
he does argue, he should do so in a gentlemanly and dispassionate
manner.

One should never notice any mistakes in the language of others.


CHAPERONAGE.

The foreign custom that makes a chaperone indispensable where young
people are gathered together at places of public entertainment, has
long obtained in the cities of the East, and in all conventional
communities everywhere. No really fashionable party is made up without
a chaperone.

A young woman condemns herself in the eyes of good society who is
observed to enter alone with a young man a place of public refreshment,
be the restaurant or tea room ever so select. Bred under other
conditions of a society so necessarily varying as that in our broad
America, a stranger visiting New York, for instance, might readily and
innocently make a mistake of this nature, and blush at finding herself
condemned for it. In the same category of offenses is ranked that of
maidens visiting places of public amusement under the escort of young
men alone. Many parts of the South and West allow this to be done
with the smiling consent of good society; but in Eastern cities it is
considered a violation of good form, and for the comfort, if not the
convenience, of the girl considering it, had better be ranked among the
lost privileges upon which social evolution may look back with fond
regret.

It is always wisest, when a number of young people are to have a
party, to ask two or three married women to be present, not only for
propriety’s sake, but because there will then be no danger of anything
unwished for happening, inasmuch as it is the duty of the chaperones to
make all social entertainments smooth and pleasant.

When it is necessary for a girl to pay long visits to a dentist’s
office, she should be accompanied either by her mother, or some woman
relative, or maid.

The etiquette of chaperonage is much less strict for a young widow than
for an unmarried girl of the same age; but it is important and in good
taste for a woman who is a widow to be very quiet and inconspicuous in
all she does, giving by her behavior no opportunity for criticism.


MARRIAGE.

A young girl’s own safety, as regards her present and future happiness,
demands that she receive attentions from only the best of young
men,—those of whom her reason would approve, if the acquaintance should
lead to more than acquaintance.

Parents should carefully watch the young men who frequent their houses,
in order to see that undesirable intimacies are not formed with their
daughters, for friendships and intimacies soon lead to love.

Many a girl, feeling convinced that she had loved unwisely, has entered
upon the married state with heart and reason at variance, when she
might have given up the acquaintance, in the beginning of it, very
easily.

The most perfect reserve in courtship, even in cases of the most ardent
attachment, is indispensable to the confidence and trust of married
life to come.

All public display of devotion should be avoided, for it tends to
lessen mutual respect, and it makes the actors ridiculous in the eyes
or others. It is quite possible for a man to show every conceivable
attention to the one to whom he is engaged, and yet to avoid committing
the slightest offence against delicacy or good taste.

It is quite possible for a man to show attention, and even assiduity
up to a certain point, without becoming a lover; and it is equally
possible for the girl to let it be seen that he is not disagreeable to
her, without actually encouraging him. No man likes to be refused, and
no man of tact will risk a refusal.

Long engagements are usually entered into by people who are quite
young, but who, for some reason, cannot marry. As the years go on their
tastes may change, and yet each may feel that honor binds the one to
the other. The woman chosen by a man when he is twenty-one is seldom
the woman he would chose when he is forty. When people marry young
they grow accustomed to each other, and, oddly enough, they grow to be
alike; but during a long engagement their tastes are apt to change, and
the result is apt to be anything but a happy one. Of course, there are
exceptions, but, generalizing, the long engagement is to be feared.


DOMESTIC ETIQUETTE AND DUTIES.

Etiquette is a comprehensive term, and its observances are nowhere more
to be desired than in the domestic circle.

If husbands and wives, generally, would render each other half of the
little attentions they lavished upon each other before marriage, their
mutual happiness would be more than doubled.

A wife should never let her husband have cause to complain that she is
more agreeable abroad than at home, nor see her negligent of dress and
manners at home when it is the reverse in company.

If, unhappily, any misunderstandings or annoyances occur between
husband and wife, it is ill-bred and unjust for either to repeat them
to a third person.

Faithful unto death in all things should be the motto of both husband
and wife; and forbearance with each other’s peculiarities, their
never-ending effort to attain.

If a girl discovers very soon after her marriage that she has made
a mistake, it is wisest for her to make the best of it; she should
look for all that is good in her husband and try to forget that which
she dislikes. There are times when a legal separation is necessary,
but when people marry they marry for better or for worse, and if,
unfortunately, it should be for worse, even that does not release them
from the solemn vows which they have taken.

It is not in good taste for a husband and wife to call each other by
endearing names in the presence of others.

A man has no right whatever to open his wife’s mail, but a woman should
not receive any letters that she would not be willing that her husband
should see.

CHAPTER V.

DRESS, GLOVES, STREET ETIQUETTE, TRAVELING, BICYCLING, TELEPHONING.

    “Refinement of character is said never to be found with
    vulgarity of dress.”


DRESS.

In appropriateness our people have something to learn, as has the
whole world, for that matter. Necklaces and jewels in the morning are
monstrous, no matter what the fashion of the moment may be, and there
will come a time when every one will look upon them with horror, as
every one, indeed, used to do.

The day is past when latitude or great variety in dress is considered
original. Clothes, if they are startling at all, must be startling in
a degree to be borne. A train cannot be worn where only a short skirt
is in order, nor can an abbreviated drapery go where full dress is
required. A garden party, for instance, or an out-of-door tea at a
private house demands a muslin, a silk, or, at any rate, an elaborate
toilet, while at a golf club, such dress is absurd, except for the
elderly or non-players. In winter, frills and furbelows, if they are
worn at all, are worn at large teas, the plain tailor-made suit having
gone out for such purposes. However, it is difficult to follow the
vagaries of fashion in these regards.

For morning wear, no dress can be too simple. Luncheons are growing
more and more informal. When distances are great, however, and one
dresses for calls in the part of town where the luncheon is, afterward,
more elaborateness of dress is allowed.

The best advice to all girls upon the subject must be, not to be
overdressed, nor yet to be careless in the matter. They should attire
themselves according to their circumstances, and should, above all
things, avoid all extremes of fashion, as well as all eccentricities of
style.

Only quiet colors should be worn either to church or on the street,
and wherever girls go they should endeavor to be unconscious of their
personal appearance.

The woman who is overdressed at an afternoon reception is much more
uncomfortable than she who is gowned with the simplicity of a Quaker. A
well fitting wool gown, a becoming bonnet, a fresh pair of gloves, and
one is suitably dressed as a caller.

A girl of fourteen should not wear her hair done up, and her gown
should come just below her ankles.

It is not in good taste for a young girl to wear diamond rings; if she
is fortunate enough to possess them, let her keep them carefully until
she is older, and then she may wear them with perfect propriety.

It is in very bad taste to wear a dressing-sacque when breakfasting
in a public dining-room of a hotel. Such an undress costume is only
permissible in one’s own room.

A frock coat is, under no circumstances, a correct garment for a man
to wear at an evening dance, neither is a Tuxedo or dinner coat. The
proper dress is a full dress suit, with white vest and white string
tie. Possibly a dinner coat might be allowable at a very small and very
informal dance, but a frock coat never.

A man should wear a white tie with a dress suit at any large formal
entertainment, such as a ball, the opera, a wedding reception, a
large dinner party, etc., and on all occasions where he wears a white
waistcoat. He should wear a black tie at the theater, at a small
dinner, in calling, and at home with his dinner coat.

Evening dress may be as gay as one chooses to make it, though extremes
are not desirable.

Dresses made a suitable length for walking are much more appropriate
for the street than those that are so long that their wearers become
street cleaners.

Neatness in a lady’s dress is one of the first requisites.

To dress well requires good taste, good sense, and refinement.

The most appropriate and becoming dress is that which so harmonizes
with the figure that the apparel is unobserved.

A hostess should be careful not to out-dress her guests.

When going out one should consider the sort of company she is likely to
meet, and should dress accordingly.

The idea that “dress makes the man” is a very false one, but a man
_does_ make, or select, rather, his dress, and is judged somewhat in
accordance with that selection.

At a five o’clock church wedding the groom, best man, and ushers all
dress as nearly as possible alike. The proper costume or suit is a
black frock coat, gray trousers, black or fancy vesting waist coat,
white tie, _glacé_ gloves, patent leather boots, and a tall hat.


GLOVES.

A young woman should of course wear gloves with a full evening dress to
any kind of an evening entertainment.

On taking one’s seat at a dinner table or a card table one may remove
one’s gloves, but not until then; and at the theater or opera, gloves
should be worn throughout the performance and during the evening.

A man wears light or white kid gloves to the opera, dances, a
reception, or any other formal evening entertainment, except a dinner.

It is usual to remove one’s gloves when eating supper at an evening
affair, unless merely a cup of bouillon or an ice may be chosen, and
then there would be no impropriety in keeping on one’s gloves.

A man wears gloves when calling, and removes them just before or just
after entering the parlor. Tan gloves may be worn at all hours of the
day; white or pearl ones are proper in the evening, when calling, or at
any place of amusement.

No matter how long one’s gloves are, they should be entirely taken off
at supper, and be resumed again upon returning to the drawing-room or
after using the finger bowls, and before arising from the feast.

To wear gloves while playing cards is an affectation of elegance.


STREET ETIQUETTE.

A man offers his right arm, if either, to a woman on the street (also
in the house), that she may have her right hand free for holding her
parasol or guiding her train. Both common sense and gallantry assign
the woman’s place where it is for her greatest convenience, and that
is, undeniably, on the right of the man.

The rule for giving the left arm was held good in those days when it
was necessary for men to pass to the left, thus keeping the sword-arm
free for self-protection or for the protection of the women, but now
the passing is all to the right.

In walking with a woman a man chooses the outer side without any regard
as to its being either the right or the left. In walking with two women
he chooses the outer side also, and never walks between them.

A man walking with a woman returns a bow made to her, lifting his hat,
although the one bowing is a stranger to him.

Ladies do not talk or call across the street.

Men should not smoke when driving or walking with women, nor on
promenades much frequented, where they cannot remove the cigar from the
mouth whenever meeting a woman.

One should never stare at another.

A man when meeting a woman who is walking and with whom he wishes to
converse, does not allow her to stand while talking, but turns and
walks with her.

A man cannot refuse to return the bow of any respectable woman. If he
does not wish to recognize her he must avoid her.

It is much less rude for women to return a recognition coldly, and upon
the next occasion to turn away or to avoid a meeting, than to give a
“cut direct.”

A man precedes a woman in passing through a crowd; but women precede
men under ordinary circumstances.

It is not proper for a young girl to walk alone with a young man after
dark, unless she is engaged to him or he is a near relative of hers.
A young woman should meet a young man with whom she has only a slight
acquaintance under her father’s or a proper guardian’s roof. When he
has become well acquainted with her and her family or friends, she may
take occasional walks with him alone in the afternoon, but never in the
evening.

When two women meet in a door-way, the younger gives precedence to the
elder.

A man does not first offer to shake hands with a woman unless he is
very well acquainted with her.

When it becomes necessary for one to address a man or woman whose name
one does not know, it should be as “Sir” or “Madam.”

It is very bad taste for young women to eat candy during a theatrical
performance, or, indeed, in any public place.


TRAVELING.

One can travel all over the United States alone, and if she conducts
herself quietly, and as a lady should, she will receive all due
respect. At the same time it is perhaps a little wiser to have a friend
with one, or even, if that is not possible, to be put in the care of
some one who is making the same journey.

When a young woman is traveling alone and is obliged to stay at a
hotel, she is shown to a reception room and sends for a clerk to come
to her. After the business arrangements are made, she either gives him
a card or tells him her name, and he registers for her. There is no
reason why she should go into a public room or register herself.

It is not customary, unless one is without luggage, to pay in advance
at a hotel.

Fees are usually given on leaving the steamer to the steward or
stewardess, deck steward, head waiter, waiter of the particular table
at which one has taken his meals, and any other servants who have made
themselves useful to him during the voyage. The amount of the fees
depends on the amount of the service that has been required, varying
from $1 to $5 for each. Living in lodgings abroad is much cheaper than
living in hotels, and in most of the large cities such accommodations
may be had at reasonable rates, and are very comfortable. The prices
for lodging vary according to location, etc. A steamer trunk should
suffice for a traveler who makes a short trip abroad and intends to
spend all his time traveling and sight-seeing. Money for a short
trip can be carried on the person, in a belt, or a pocket hung about
the neck. For a trip of some length a letter of credit is more
convenient, and can be obtained from any banking-house having foreign
connections. In some countries traveling in the second-class carriages
is very comfortable; in others it is not. In Italy a traveler can be
comfortable only by traveling first-class; in France second-class is
not bad; and in Germany and Great Britain it is perfectly comfortable,
and preferable to first-class in many respects.

A rush and scramble at a railway ticket office is only carried on by
ill-bred people, or by those who appear so at the time.

If a woman offers to seat herself beside a man, he should rise at once
and give her the choice of seats.

No real gentlemen would be unmindful of the comfort and convenience of
women, while traveling, from a selfish motive.

In the cars one has no right to keep a window open, if the current of
air thus produced annoys another.

A woman should always be careful to thank a person for any little
attention he may bestow upon her while traveling.


BICYCLING.

As to rules of politeness for bicyclers, one who is a true lady will
show herself to be one as surely when riding a wheel as at any other
time, not only by her costume, which will be unobtrusive in color, cut,
and adjustment, but by her manner, which will be even more quiet and
self-possessed than usual, as she well knows that by mounting a wheel
she makes herself more or less conspicuous. It goes without saying that
she will not ride fast enough to attract undue attention; that she will
not chew gum; and that she will not allow advances from strangers,
who may, like herself, be on a wheel, and, to all appearances, may be
gentlemen. Neither will she ride off alone after dark, nor take long
rides in the evening attended only by an escort. In the daytime, when
out only with a man friend, she will avoid stopping to rest under the
trees and in out of the way places. Too much care cannot be taken,
especially by young girls, as to appearances. Their very innocence and
ignorance lays them open to criticism.


TELEPHONING.

For the benefit of those who but seldom make use of the telephone, and
consequently feel more or less ill at ease when attempting to use one,
and also for those who, from ignorance of the first laws of politeness,
or who, from thoughtlessness, ignore them, a few hints upon the subject
may not come amiss. It is after having called up “Central,” and been
given the number requested, that one often stands in need of no small
amount of tact and good breeding, as well as of some idea of the best
method of procedure. When there are several different persons using
the same line, two or three of them may mistake the call for theirs,
and all rush to the telephone at once. If at all stupid, or lacking in
politeness, they will make it quite unpleasant for each other. The one
entitled to speak should politely inquire for the one for whom she has
called at the telephone, also giving her own name as the one delivering
the message. If this does not suffice to enlighten those who sometimes
keep calling “hello,” “hello,” without waiting to learn if they are
the ones desired, the one talking should again announce herself, and
the name of the one to whom she wishes to speak. Then, occasionally,
even while in the midst of a conversation, some one will break in
with a “Hello!” “Who is it?” “What do you want?” etc., which is quite
distracting. If one can gain a hearing in no other way, it is well to
say: “Excuse me, I hold the line.” If this does not bring order out of
chaos, one should ring off and call again.

One should be careful not to call up friends at inconvenient hours,
and when one is notified by a servant, or otherwise, that someone, the
name being given, is at the telephone wishing to speak with her, she
should certainly be as expeditious as possible in replying; for, by
holding the wire, she is inconveniencing others, as well as the one
who is waiting for her. No lady needs to be warned against speaking
discourteously under any circumstances to the telephone assistants at
the central office. It is in these little things that one shows herself
to be well-bred or not.

None, of course, but the most informal of invitations can be delivered
by telephone.

Servants should be taught always to answer the telephone politely and
intelligently. When answering, a servant should say whose residence it
is, if asked, not by giving the family name, as “Smith,” but as “Mr.
Smith,” and then, if asked who is at the instrument, she should reply,
“Mrs. Smith’s cook” or “maid.”

One’s individual manners, and ordinary polite or impolite forms of
address, are very noticeable when accentuated by the telephone.

CHAPTER VI.

THE TABLE AND SERVICE AT TABLE, HABITS AT TABLE, SERVANTS AND SERVING.

    “God may forgive sins, but awkwardness has no
    forgiveness in Heaven or earth.”—_Hawthorne._


THE TABLE AND SERVICE AT TABLE.

The table looks best when not over-decorated. The housekeeper who
cannot make changes in her table decoration finds that a mirror
centerpiece is a background that multiplies the beauty of her flowers,
fruit, leaves, or whatever may constitute the decoration.

A unique and effective decoration for a luncheon table is made of long,
narrow bouquets of white carnations, tied with bows of yellow satin
ribbon, and arranged so that the ribbons all meet in the center of the
table, while the points are directed towards the guests. The effect is
of a great golden-hearted daisy.

A pretty conceit for decorating a dainty table is to cluster a number
of small palms together in the center of the table. Around these place
small ferns, while beyond the latter arrange yards of smilax so as to
conceal the pots. Outside of all have a flat border composed of loose
bunches of pinks, roses, and maiden-hair ferns. Tie these with wide
pink satin ribbons, a long end of which should extend from each bouquet
down to the place of each of the women guests, and have her name
painted in gold upon it. Then there should be _boutonnières_ of pink
carnations for the men.

Menu cards are not ordinarily used at any but the most formal kind of
an entertainment. They are always seen at large functions, men’s public
dinners, etc., which are usually given in a hotel or restaurant; but
in a private house individual menu cards, whether at a dinner or a
luncheon, are exceptional.

When the dinner is large and formal, or even when it numbers only eight
or ten, it is wise to have small cards with the names of the guests
at each place at the table, and, if the guests are strangers to each
other, to have a tray in the men’s dressing-room or hall where they
remove their coats and hats with tiny envelopes addressed to each,
containing little cards on which is written the name of the dinner
partner. The hostess must see that, as soon as two dinner partners are
in the receiving room before dinner, they meet each other, and have a
chance for a little conversation before the meal is announced; and she
should also make a point to introduce each woman before dinner to the
man who is to sit on the other side of her.

Introductions are not proper at the table, and at a large dinner it is
awkward to introduce all one’s guests to each other before the meal.
At a small dinner, of course, it is not necessary to observe all this
formality, and the hostess may introduce her guests to each other
without much ceremony, when the company numbers only four or six; but
with more, each woman should be provided with a partner who escorts her
to the table. At a small function there need be but a few minutes of
waiting before the guests are all seated. The guest of honor sits at
the right of the host.

As to the manner of arranging the table, there is some difference
of opinion. However, generally speaking, there should be a napkin,
squarely folded, in front of each guest, and at the left of it the
forks, _i. e._, a fish fork and a large and a small ordinary fork.
At the right of the napkin should be the knives and spoons, a glass,
bread-and-butter plate (if used), and a salt cellar; and in the center
of the table on an embroidered centerpiece or circular mirror, the
floral decorations. At the head of the table, upon an embroidered
square, are laid the tea service,—the urn, the cups and saucers, the
cream pitcher, sugar bowl, etc.; at the other end are placed the dishes
for serving. Scattered about on circular doilies are the dishes of
jelly, preserves, pickles (sweet and sour), olives, salted almonds, etc.

Chafing-dishes are used to prepare such dishes as terrapin, oysters, or
whatever may be cooked absolutely on the table. A napkin and plate, or
tray, is best liked for removing crumbs.

Finger bowls should always follow the last course at formal and
informal meals alike, except at breakfast, when, if fruit is the first
course, the finger-bowl is put on the table when the covers are laid
ready for the fruit course.

Spoon-holders are no longer used, but if one should be fancied it would
be better to put the bowl of the spoon in the holder first.

Unless one serves something more than wafers, small cakes, tea, and
chocolate on an “at home” day, napkins are not necessary; if, however,
there is some dish that will soil the fingers or the lips, then there
should be a pile of small napkins on the tea-table.

Tooth-picks should not be put on the table, nor should they be used
outside one’s own room.

It is not necessary to fold one’s napkin when only one meal is to be
eaten in the house in which one is staying.

The day for tying cakes, sandwiches, etc., with ribbons has passed.

The waitress should stand with a tray in her hand behind the host’s
chair to receive each plate as it is filled, passing it to the left
of the guest, and waiting for him to remove it. When the hostess is
pouring tea or coffee, the maid’s place is by her left side in waiting
for the cups. After that she should be on the alert to see when the
glasses need filling, or when there is bread, pickles, or anything to
be passed. When removing the plates it should be from the right side of
the guest, but everything should be offered at the left that the right
hand may be used to receive it.

When a dish is passed and there is no maid in attendance, one should
help himself and pass it on. If a dish is standing near one, under such
circumstances, he may quite properly ask if he may help himself, and do
so.

When a plate is passed for a helping, the knife and fork are laid well
to the side of the plate, so placed that they will not fall off, and
yet not be in the way of the server.

All the appurtenances of each course should be removed before the
succeeding one is served. The bread-and-butter plates, however, should
be removed before the salad course, as crackers and cheese are passed
with this, the salad plate being used to hold all three things.

The salted almonds should be started about the table by the hostess
soon after the guests are seated. Some hostesses possess cut-glass
or china individual dishes, on which the almonds are placed when the
guest helps himself, but it is quite usual for them to be placed on the
bread-and-butter plate.

Bonbons should be passed by the maid when the coffee is served, and
eaten from the plate from which the finger-bowl and doily have been
removed.

It is not important whether tumblers or goblets are used on the
dinner-table; each season brings its own custom.

The bread-and-butter plates at a formal dinner serve the purpose
only of bread plates, as it is not customary to serve butter on such
occasions. If it is used, however, butter should be made into tiny
balls, and one or two placed on each bread-and-butter plate.

It is customary to put the vegetables served with the meat on the
same plate. The use of individual dishes for vegetables is no longer
approved.

Oranges are seldom served at dinner unless they are specially prepared,
that is, with the skin taken off, and the sections divided, in which
case the fruit is eaten from a fork.

Cheese and crackers of some sort are always served with salad courses.

At a formal dinner bouillon or consommé is usually served in
soup-plates. At a supper or luncheon it is oftenest served in cups. The
regulation cups are those having handles on each side.

When oysters are served on the half-shell, they are usually placed upon
the table before the meal is announced.

It is not customary to serve fruit as a first course at dinner, though
at a lunch it is quite proper.

Grape-fruit must be served ice cold. It is served in two ways: either
it is cut in halves, midway between the blossom and the stem end, the
seeds removed, the pulp loosened with a sharp knife, but served in
the natural skin, to be eaten with a spoon; or the pulp and seeds are
entirely removed from the skin with a sharp knife, and the edible part
only served in deep dessert plates. Pulverized sugar should accompany
grape-fruit.

In waiting upon plates, one should never pour gravy on the food, but
place it at one side.

The salad course at dinner always succeeds the game course.

After dinner coffee is served in small cups and without cream. In
many houses rock-candy, crushed in very small pieces, is used as a
substitute for sugar, the claim being made that it gives a purer
sweetness.

Cut sugar is served with coffee, and powdered sugar with fruit or
oatmeal.

Coffee may be served at the table or in the drawing-room as is best
liked. People are not asked if they will have it; it is served to them.
Only sugar is offered with black coffee.


HABITS AT TABLE.

Nothing indicates the good breeding of a man so much as his manners
at table. There are a thousand little points to be observed, which,
although not absolutely necessary, distinctly stamp the refined and
well-bred man. A man may pass muster by dressing well, and may sustain
himself tolerably in conversation; but, if he is not nearly perfect in
table etiquette, dining will betray him.

Any unpleasant peculiarity, abruptness, or coarseness of manner is
especially offensive at table. People are more easily disgusted at
that time than at any other.

One should never rest the arms upon the table, but keep the left hand,
when not in use, lying quietly in the lap.

A man guest should never precede his hostess into or out of the
dining-room, but should wait respectfully by the door for her to pass.

A soup-plate should never be tilted for the last spoonful.

The mouth should be kept closed in eating, and as little noise made as
possible.

A goblet should be held by the stem, and not by the bowl.

Bread should be broken and not cut before buttering it to eat.

A knife should never be used at table except where one is unable to cut
his food with his fork; it should never be used in conveying food to
the mouth.

A knife should be held by its handle, and the finger not allowed to
extend up on the blade. In eating with a fork it should be held in the
right hand.

The fork is generally used with the tines curving upward.

Olives are eaten from the fingers; pickles, from a fork. It is usual to
put either a small fork or a long-handled spoon with a small bowl on
the dish containing olives or pickles, and one should use it in helping
one’s self.

The tips of the fingers are put in the finger-bowls and may then
moisten the lips. Both lips and finger tips are dried on the napkin,
which is not afterwards folded.

Watermelons are eaten with a fork, and cantaloupes with either a spoon
or a fork.

A baked potato should be eaten from the plate after it has been pushed
out of its skin by the fork.

Dried beef is eaten with a fork.

Grape seeds may be removed from the mouth with the fingers. The seeds
of watermelons should be taken from the fruit with a fork before the
fruit is put into the mouth.

Fish bones are taken from the mouth with the fingers. Care, however, is
usually taken to leave as few bones as possible in the fish, since the
general use of the silver knife with the silver fork has made it easy
to separate the bones from the meat.

Bananas are broken with a fork, and a piece is conveyed to the mouth on
a fork.

When a servant offers one a dish, he should help himself without taking
it from her hand.

When drinking from a cup, the spoon should be left in the saucer, where
it also remains when the cup is empty.

It is not proper to eat gravy with bits of bread; instead, it should be
regarded as a sauce, and simply eaten on the meat of which it forms a
portion.

It is decreed by custom that the small bones of any bird may be taken
in the fingers, and the meat eaten from the bone. But this must always
be done daintily.

What is known as “layer cake” is eaten from a fork, and in serving it
one uses either a pie-knife or a tablespoon and a fork.

Cheese is eaten with a fork.

After-dinner coffee is taken directly from the cup, and not from the
spoon.

Crackers should be eaten from the hand, and not be broken into soup.

When bread is passed, one takes a slice as it is cut, and does not
break it and leave a portion on the plate. Bread is always eaten from
the fingers.

Raw oysters are eaten with a small oyster-fork from the shell. In
helping one’s self to salt, the little salt-spoon is used, and the salt
is placed on the plate.

When strawberries are served with their stems on, one picks one up by
the stem, dips it into the soft sugar at the side of the plate, and
eats it from the stem. Bonbons are eaten from the fingers. If a spoon
is in the dish from which they are served, then one uses it; if not,
the fingers are proper.

An apple or a pear may be held on a fork, and pared with a knife; or it
may be quartered, and each quarter held in the fingers, and then pared.
Dates are eaten from the fingers.

When one answers “thank you” to an invitation to partake of a certain
dish at the table, “yes” is meant.

One should break a small piece of bread off the slice, then butter it
and eat it. Only very small children in the nursery bite from a slice
of buttered bread.

One need not fear to take the last piece on the plate when it is
offered. It would be more impolite to refuse it.

It is very bad form to pile up, or in any way arrange the plates or
small dishes put before one, for the benefit of the waiter. She should
do her own work, which is to take away the plates without any help.

When one wishes for bread, or anything of that sort, he should simply
ask for it, either addressing his request to the servant or, if there
is none, to whomever the bread may be nearest, if it is on the table.

Upon leaving the table, and the signal for leaving is given when the
hostess rises, one’s napkin should be placed upon the table unfolded,
unless one is to remain for another meal.

At a formal dinner party the host should enter the dining-room first
and with the lady in whose honor the dinner is given; the hostess goes
into the dining-room last with the most important man guest, who should
be seated at her right.

Where menus are used they should be placed on the left-hand side,
beside the forks. When the dinner is over, at a signal from the
hostess, the women rise and retire to the drawing-room, where coffee
is usually served, the men remaining in the dining-room for coffee and
cigars.

Five o’clock tea may be served in a variety of ways: the hostess may
brew it herself in a teapot upon her tea-table in the parlor; she
may make it by pouring boiling water over a tea-ball; or it may be
served by either a man or maid servant in the dining-room. Its proper
accompaniments are sugar, cream, sliced lemon, and either wafers, thin
sandwiches, or cake.

It is in better form to have a luncheon served at a large table,
especially when the guests do not number more than twenty, than to have
small tables. Two o’clock is the fashionable hour for a luncheon;
after it is over the guests usually disperse.

A host, in entertaining at a hotel or a restaurant, even if he
entertains only one woman, should give the order for the meal himself,
and save her the slight embarrassment it may be for her to make her
own selection. The most courteous thing is for him to order the meal
beforehand, but if the occasion is very informal and he prefers to
wait until they are at the table, he should, after he and his guest
are seated, hand the menu to her and ask if she has any especial
preference, and then, respecting her wishes, give the order himself to
the waiter.

If, however, friends happen in, and are asked informally to stay to
a meal at a hotel, they may order themselves what they want from the
menu, and, if necessary, the host or hostess of the occasion may pay
the bill before leaving the dining-room, but the bill should not be
paid until the guests have departed.

In giving one’s order for dinner at the hotel, oysters come first, then
soup, fish, a roast or a bird, ices, whatever dessert may be desired,
and coffee. Very often a woman is well served, when she is alone, by
allowing the waiter to arrange a dinner for her.

If the only guest at the family dinner-table is a man, he should not be
served until all the ladies of the family have been attended to.

If the hostess is the only woman at the table, she is served first,
as a lady is of most importance from a social standpoint, and it is
always proper to attend to her wants first. After her the man who is a
visitor, or whose age gives him precedence, receives attention.

The guest of honor at a tea arrives a little earlier than the other
guests, and remains somewhat later, but at a luncheon or dinner she
should appear at the regulation time. One should remove one’s gloves
at a luncheon, but the retaining of the hat is entirely a matter of
personal taste.

The inconsiderate guest who arrives late for luncheon or dinner is
shown immediately into the dining-room, and the hostess does not leave
her guests, but simply rises and motions him to a seat when he enters
the room.

Ten minutes is the time usually allowed for each course where more than
a six-course dinner is served.

The correct and usual way of seating a bridal party at a wedding
entertainment is for the groom to sit at one end of the table, and
the bride at the other end, the best man on the bride’s right, and
the maid of honor or first bridemaid on the groom’s right. The other
bridemaids and ushers are placed wherever seems best. As a usual thing,
the parents of the bride and groom do not sit at the same table with
the immediate bridal party, but at another table, together with the
near relatives on both sides, and perhaps the minister who officiated
at the wedding and his wife; but if it seems desirable to have the
parents at the bridal table, it is perfectly proper to seat them there.

There are certain distinctive features of a bridal table which must be
in evidence. One is the wedding or bride’s cake, and this cake should
be the central ornament, and should be surrounded with a wreath of
roses. The place-cards should have the initials of the bride and groom
woven together for decoration, and the souvenirs may be small satin
boxes containing wedding cake.


SERVANTS AND SERVING.

There is so much to say upon the subject of servants, notwithstanding
so much has already been said, it is difficult to know where to begin.
But, in the first place, every woman should remember that servants are,
like herself, human, and that in our free America, they are becoming
very independent, not to say self-assertive. Thus a house mistress has
no small matter to deal with when she demands obedience and respectful
attention from girls who are generally ignorant, and often impudent
and ill-bred. The greatest strength of the mistress lies in her power
to control herself, and while she must demand respectfulness from her
servants, she can often avoid a clash with them by using a little tact.
If they are treated in a kind, though dignified, manner, unless very
degenerate, they will usually respond satisfactorily.

One can speak, with perfect propriety, of the one servant employed as
“the maid,” but not as “our girl.”

Servants should be expected to dress neatly, and where there is but
one, she should have a clean white apron ready to put on when answering
the door-bell, being prepared with a tray to receive the caller’s card.
She should also know, before answering the bell, who is in and who is
not at home, and what excuse, if any, to make for each one called for.

Servants should never be allowed to call any member of the family from
a distance, as from the foot of the stairs, but should go to the one to
whom she wishes to speak, and deliver her message.

It is hard to say, under all circumstances, what to expect of a nursery
governess, and what should be her privileges. To treat her with the
greatest consideration is well worth while; for one is compensated in
being able to get an intelligent, ladylike woman who may be trusted
to guide her charges wisely. One may ask a governess to sleep in the
same room with the children, dress and undress them, eat with them, and
teach them, and take the entire charge of them; but, of course, one
will provide some attractive place for her to sit during the evening,
while the children are asleep in her room. It is also necessary to see
that her meals are well cooked and carefully served, and to permit
her to be free one afternoon and evening every week. She should be
addressed as “Miss Smith,” not by her first name.

It is expedient to supervise the work of the general house-work servant
as much as possible; and if it is more convenient for her to go up the
front stairs to announce callers, and to go down them to answer the
front door, certainly allow her to use the front stairs instead of the
back ones on occasions. A waitress or parlor-maid is no more privileged
to use the front stairs than a general house-work servant. A nurse may
be, with propriety, wherever her charges are allowed.

If a maid is expected to wear a cap, it is usually furnished by the
lady of the house.

It is good form to address the servants one knows when entering a
house, and to thank them for any attention.

It is unfortunate that the English system of feeing has come into vogue
here. But it is quite customary now, for a guest, after a visit, even a
short one, to bestow upon a servant a small fee, say, of a dollar.

CHAPTER VII.

FUNERALS, MOURNING.

    Civility implies self-sacrifice; it is the last touch,
    the crowning perfection of a noble character.—_Mathews._


FUNERALS.

At no place is a lack of system, and an observance of formality, more
noticeable than at a funeral. An undertaker generally has charge
of the details, and where he is well informed and has sufficient
assistance, he can manage affairs nicely, but there is a great deal of
unostentatious service that may be done by friends, indeed, must be.
They can assist the servants in arranging the house, flowers, etc.,
before the funeral; meet any who may call at the door; and in every way
stand between the afflicted family and the outside world. Of course
none but intimate friends can be of service at such a time. All others,
no matter how willing, can but call at the door with offers of service,
and even that should not be carried far enough to appear intrusive.

At a house funeral the family remains upstairs, or in a side room,
and is not seen. The remains are in the drawing-room, where they are
usually viewed by those present when passing out. The clergyman stands
near the head of the casket, if in so doing his voice can be well
heard. If there is singing, it is usually done by a quartet or by a
smaller number of persons, who are seated at the head of the stairs out
of sight and unaccompanied by any musical instrument. Those who are not
going to the cemetery quietly disperse at the close of the service.
Carriages are in waiting for the family, and the cortege moves as soon
after the close of the service as possible.

In the meantime the nurse (if one still remains at the house), or some
friend, with the assistance of the servants, makes everything look as
natural and pleasant as possible before the return of the family. If
visitors come in later, of course it depends upon circumstances whether
or not they should be admitted.

Church funerals are more formal. The congregation assembles, and when
the carriages containing the family arrive, the organ plays softly, and
the procession enters, the relatives walking close to the casket, and
sitting as near it as possible. After the services the procession moves
out in the same order, and the people in the pews wait until is has
passed on.

The crêpe that is hung at the door-bell has often combined with it
ribbon streamers, those for the aged being black, for a younger person
purple, and for a child white with white crêpe also. Flowers should be
sent to the bereaved, in due time after the death, in token of sympathy.


MOURNING.

The putting on of mourning is a question that should be decided
entirely by those most deeply concerned. Many families never follow the
custom, and even wear white instead of black on the day of the funeral,
while others seem to consider the wearing of crêpe as a mark of respect
shown to the dead. To assume the expense such a change in clothing
would entail, may sometimes be placing a burden upon the living for
the sake of the dead, which certainly neither custom nor reason should
demand. Then, to many, the wearing of crêpe is so depressing that it
is a sin against one’s self to put it on. None but narrow-minded,
uncultivated persons would ever think of criticising one for not doing
so. Of course one would naturally feel like dressing in as subdued
colors as possible, if not in assuming half mourning (black and white,
lavendar, drab, etc.) if not deep black or crêpe.

When mourning is worn by a wife for a husband, it is worn from one to
two years, at least.

The question of wearing mourning for one’s betrothed must be decided
by one’s self, for it is purely a personal question that the laws of
etiquette do not govern.

When crêpe is laid aside, black-bordered paper and black-bordered cards
are no longer proper. While wearing all black on the street, after
crêpe is laid aside, one may wear, with propriety, all white in the
house.

While in deep mourning one does not go into society. All that mourning
etiquette demands is that one acknowledge her calls with her visiting
cards, which should be sent in return for a call within two weeks after
it is made, and should go by hand rather than by mail.

One sends invitations to one’s friends who are in mourning, to show
that they are not forgotten.




CHAPTER VIII.

POLITENESS OF YOUNG CHILDREN.

    Give a boy address and accomplishments, and you give
    him the mastery of palaces and fortunes wherever he
    goes.—_Ralph Waldo Emerson._


A mother once asked a clergyman when she should begin to educate her
child, then three years old. “Madam,” was his reply, “you have lost
three years already.”

As soon as the child can talk, its lessons in politeness should begin.
Among a child’s first words should be “please” and “thank you.”

A child should never be allowed to leave the table, after it is old
enough to understand and to say it, without asking to be excused.

A child should be taught to pass behind and not before one.

Little boys should never be allowed to keep their hats on in the house.

Children, when very young, should be taught to be generous and polite
to their little visitors, and, if necessary, to give up all of anything
where half will not do.

Children should be taught to “take turns” in playing games, and that no
one should monopolize the pleasantest part of a game.

Children soon feel a pride in being little ladies and gentlemen, rather
than in being rude and impolite.

If mothers would impress upon their children’s minds how stupid they
appear when they stand staring at one without answering when addressed
with “good morning” or a like salutation, they would be anxious to know
what to say, and to say it.

Children do not always know what to answer when addressed. They ought
to be taught, so that they may feel no embarrassment.

When children inconvenience others, they ought to be taught to say
“excuse me” or “beg pardon.”

In the cars, or in any public place, a boy or a girl should always
rise, and give his or her place to an older person.

A child should always learn that it is both naughty and rude to
contradict, and to say “what for” and “why,” when told to do anything.

A mother who is as careful of her child’s moral nature and manners as
of his physical nature, will guard him from naughty and rude playmates
as closely as she would from measles or whooping-cough.

A mother should never allow any disrespect in her children’s manners
toward herself, nor toward any one older than they are. They should be
taught especially to reverence the aged.

Habits of politeness and kindness to the poor are of great worth, and
easily formed in childhood.

Virtue is born of good habits, and the formation of habits may be said
to constitute almost the whole work of education.

Habits have been compared to handcuffs, easily put on and difficult to
rid one’s self of.

Those parents who regulate their lives in accordance with the commands
of the Bible, find many verses which are of great assistance in
teaching politeness to young children, such as, “Be ye courteous one to
another,” “Be respectful to your elder,” “Do to others as ye would that
they should do to you,” etc.

A child should be thoroughly trained with regard to table manners. The
well-bred child will not chew his food with his mouth half open, talk
with it in his mouth, nor make any unnecessary noises in eating; and he
will handle his knife and fork properly.

Children should be taught that it is very rude to look into drawers or
boxes, or, in fact, to meddle with or handle anything away from home
that is not intended for them to play with.

Children should be made to understand that they must not ask too many
questions promiscuously, such as, “Where are you going?” “What have you
there?” etc.

A child should be taught never to tease a playmate’s mother, or to have
its own mother teased by a playmate. Teasing should not be allowed.

Children should never be allowed to say “I won’t” and “I will,” even to
each other.

Children should never be allowed to speak of an elder person by the
last name without the proper prefix. They should also be taught, in
addressing boys and girls, say, sixteen years of age, to use the
prefix, as “Miss” or “Mr.,” before the given name; thus “Miss Alice”
or “Mr. George.” In fact, all people should observe this rule in
addressing the young, except in case the older person is very familiar
with the younger, or in case the latter is too young to be so addressed.

Children are now taught to say, “Yes, mamma,” “What, mamma?” “Thank
you, mamma,” “Yes, Mrs. Allen,” “What, Mrs. Allen?” etc., in preference
to “Yes, ma’am,” “No, ma’am,” etc.

Children should be taught that it is rude to yawn without trying to
suppress it, or without concealing the mouth with the hand; to whistle
or hum in the presence of older persons; or to make any monotonous
noise with feet or hands, beating time, etc.; to play with napkin
rings, or any article at table during meal time; to pick the teeth
with the fingers; to trim or clean one’s nails outside one’s room; to
lounge anywhere in the presence of company; to place the elbows on the
table, or to lean upon it while eating; to speak of absent persons by
their first names, when they would not so address them if they were
present; to acquire the habit of saying “you know,” “says he,” “says
she;” to use slang words; to tattle; to hide the mouth with the hand
when speaking; to point at anyone or anything with the finger; to stare
at persons; to laugh at one’s own stories or remarks; to toss articles
instead of handing them; to leave the table with food in the mouth; to
take possession of a seat that belongs to another without instantly
rising upon his return; to leave anyone without saying “good-by;” to
interrupt any one in conversation; to push; to ridicule others; to
pass, without speaking, any one whom they know; etc.

Some young people are not as particular as they should be about certain
articles of the toilet, such as combs, brushes, etc. One should always
have such things for his own individual use. It is exceedingly
impolite to use any toilet article belonging to another.

It is ill-mannered to ask questions about affairs that do not concern
one, or to pry into the private affairs of one’s friends. To inquire
the cost of articles indiscriminately, is impudent.

If parents are not at home when visitors come in, or are too busy to
see them at once, a child, in the absence of a maid, should politely
show them in, offer them a comfortable chair, show them anything he
thinks they will be interested in, and make every effort to entertain
them agreeably until such time as his parents can take his place. He
should then politely withdraw from the room.

Children and young people should early learn not to monopolize the best
light or the most desirable seat in the room, but to look about when
anyone enters, whether a guest or an older member of their own family,
and see if by giving up their own place the new-comer may be made more
comfortable.

A boy ought to show to his mother and sisters every attention he would
show to any other woman. Should they chance to meet on the street he
should politely raise his hat. He should allow them to pass first
through a door, give them the inside of the walk, help them into a
carriage, and everywhere and under all circumstances treat them with
politeness and deference. Girls should of course treat their brothers
in the same polite manner; for they can hardly expect to receive
attentions where they are unwilling to bestow them.

Children, especially little boys, should be taught not to precede their
mothers, or any woman, into theaters, street cars, churches, elevators,
or into the house or even a room.


SCHOOL-ROOM ETIQUETTE.

    “Good manners are the shadows of virtues, if not
    virtues themselves.”

If teachers realized the inestimable amount of good they might
accomplish by giving a little time and thought to the manners of their
pupils, surely they would willingly give it. Those of their pupils who
have no proper training at home would thus gain a knowledge which, in
after life, would prove a blessing. And such a course acted upon by the
teacher would be of great assistance to the parents of those who are
well trained at home; for a large portion of a child’s time is spent in
school, and under conditions that require such training.

Teachers must treat their scholars politely if they expect polite
treatment from them.

Every teacher should see that no pupil is allowed to treat those of a
lower station in life with disrespect.

It is a common occurrence for a teacher to speak with seeming
disrespect of a pupil’s parents, blaming them for the pupil’s lack of
interest in school, truancy, etc. Such a course is highly reprehensible
in the teacher, and gains the pupil’s ill-will. It is better to assume
that the parents would be displeased with anything wrong in the pupil,
and to appeal to the pupil for his mother’s or father’s sake.

A teacher should never allow herself or himself to be addressed by
pupils as “Teacher,” but as Miss or Mr. Smith.

If pupils would take pains to bid a teacher “good-morning” and
“good-night,” they would appear well in so doing, and easily give
pleasure to another.

The entire atmosphere of a school-room is dependent upon trifles. Where
a teacher, by her own actions and in accordance with her requirements,
insures kindness and politeness from all to all, she may feel almost
sure of the success of her school.

Young misses ought to be addressed by the teacher as “Miss Julia,”
“Miss Annie.” Young boys (too young to be addressed as Mr.) should be
addressed as “Master Brown,” “Master Jones,” etc.

Teachers should use great discretion in reproving any unintentional
rudeness, especially on the part of those ignorant from lack of home
training. If such were reproved gently and privately, it would be
more efficacious and just. No one should be allowed to appear to
disadvantage from ignorance.

Selfishness, untruthfulness, slang, rowdyism, egotism, or any show of
superiority should be corrected in the school-room.

Young teachers hardly realize with what fear and dread mothers intrust
to them their carefully reared children, especially young ones.

CHAPTER X.

OFFICIAL ETIQUETTE.

    “Good fashion rests on realty, and hates nothing so
    much as pretenders.”—_Emerson._


All presentations to foreign courts are made through the national
representatives, and from them is received all the information desired
in reference to the necessary forms and ceremonies.

Kings and queens are addressed as “Your Majesty.” The Prince of Wales,
the crown princes, and all other princes and princesses are addressed
as “Your Royal Highness.”

The President’s “levees” at Washington are open to all, and are
conducted very much as an ordinary “reception.” As one enters, an
official announces him, and he proceeds directly to the president and
his lady, and pays his respects.

The door of the White House may be said never to be closed, and any
one who desires may call upon its occupants as upon those of any other
dwelling. He may not, however, obtain a personal interview. This, to be
secured, he must seek in the company of an official or intimate friend
of the president, who will be able to judge of the claims for attention
of a visitor.

No particular style of dress is required to make one’s appearance at
the Republican Court.

No refreshments are expected to be offered at a presidential reception.

Custom does not require that the wife of the president of the United
States should return official calls. Exception is made in the case of
visiting Royalty. The wives of the foreign ambassadors should make the
first call upon the wife of the vice-president, as should the wives
of the cabinet officials. At a function given by officials of foreign
governments at Washington, the wife of the secretary of state takes
precedence over the wives of the foreign ambassadors.

CHAPTER XI.

BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE, APPLICATIONS, ETC.

    Since custom is the principal magistrate of human
    life, let men by all means endeavor to obtain good
    customs.—_Lord Bacon._


CORRESPONDENCE.

BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE.

Closely written postal cards and long letters meet with little favor
among business men; therefore it is important to make business
correspondence as plain and brief as possible.

Names of places and persons should be written very plainly.

When a letter is written in reply to another, the date of the letter to
which the reply is made should be given, and it is an excellent plan,
and one that saves much time, to give in a letter the substance of the
one to which it is a reply. This is especially desirable when accepting
a special offer made in such letter, thus:

    Mr. A. FLANAGAN, Chicago, Illinois.

    _Dear Sir:_

    Your favor of Feb. 15, in which you offer us a discount
    of 33-1/3 per cent. on your books, when purchased in
    lots of 100 or more, came duly. We herewith enclose
    our check for three hundred dollars ($300.), for which
    please ship us, by freight the following:

  100 copies of “Words; Their Use and Abuse.”
  100    “      “Getting on in the World.”
  100    “      “Hours with Men and Books.”

                                    Respectfully,
                                      GEO. W. JONES & CO.

    Boulder, Colo., April 3, 1899.


    Griggsville, Ill. MESSRS. HARPER & BROTHERS, New York.

    _Gentlemen:_

    Enclosed is a post-office order for $3, for which
    please send me Harper’s New Monthly Magazine for one
    year, beginning with the May number.

                              Respectfully,
                                     (MISS) SARA BROWN.

When writing a business letter, a married woman should sign her name as
she would sign it when writing any other letter; that is, by placing
her first name and surname in the usual position of the signature, and
adding, a little to the left-hand, her name in full, with the address,
thus:

                           St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9th, 1899.

    MESSRS. HARPER & BROTHERS, New York.

    _Gentlemen:_

    Please send me one copy of “How Women Should Ride,” for
    which you will find enclosed one dollar and twenty-five
    cents ($1.25).

                                    Respectfully,
                                         EMMA C. BOWEN.
   MRS. CHARLES E. BOWEN,
          324 Dupont Avenue.

When writing to a person or firm for information solely for one’s own
benefit, a postal card or a stamped envelope should be enclosed for a
reply.

It is a too common custom among people unacquainted with the rules
of business, when sending an order to one firm, to enclose money to
be paid another, or with which to make small purchases in some other
line, to be sent in the package ordered from the firm with which the
correspondence is held. The proper way to do when one wishes to order
goods from different houses in the same city, and yet have all the
goods shipped in the same package, is to write an order to each firm
requesting the goods to be delivered to the firm with which one does
the most business, having, of course, notified such firm of his action.

It has become so common among people to request everything “by return
mail” that business men look upon such requests as a mere form, rather
than as an evidence of urgency. If such urgency exists, it is well to
state the cause of it in a few words, and request immediate attention
to the order, thus:

                            Harvard, Ill., Nov. 2, 1899.

    MESSRS. A. C. MCCLURG & CO., Chicago.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I enclose herewith $2, for which please send me a copy
    of Longfellow’s poetical works. You will oblige me by
    sending the book by return mail, as I wish to use it on
    the evening of the 4th inst.

                                      Respectfully,
                                            JAMES WELLS.

Whoever writes a caustic letter makes a mistake; for it will do no
good, even if there seems to be a cause for it, and if the assumed
cause proves to be simply a mistake the writer will be humiliated.


LETTERS OF APPLICATION.

It is sometimes difficult to write a letter of application, because
one must speak of himself and of his ability to fill the position
sought, and to do so without seeming egotistic. If the applicant has
had experience in work similar to that for which he applies, a simple
statement of the fact, the length of time engaged in such work, the
reason for quitting his last position, and the name and address of his
former employer, should form the substance of his letter. If he has had
no experience, he should state what advantages he has had to qualify
himself for the work, and not boast that he could soon and easily learn
to do it.

The following will exemplify the points:


                                124 La Salle St.,
                                   Chicago, Sept. 24, 1899.

    MESSRS. A. G. BAKER & CO.,
                   Kirkwood, Ohio.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I am informed by a friend, Mr. C. A. Brooks, of your
    village, that you are in want of a book-keeper, and
    I desire to make application for the position. I am
    a young man, but have had several years experience
    in keeping books. I am now in charge of the books of
    Messrs. Jones & Williams, of this city, to whom I
    can refer you for information as to my ability and
    character. I desire to go to the country, and should be
    glad to work for you, if you can pay me $70 per month,
    which is my present salary.

                                 Very respectfully,
                                           T. R. MILLER.


                               Salem, Wis., May 15, 1899.
    MESSRS. CLARK & WILLIAMS,
    107 State Street, Chicago.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I am informed that your shipping clerk is soon to
    leave, and that the position now held by him will be
    vacant. I desire to apply for the same, but I am sorry
    to state that I have not had any experience in this
    particular line of work; however, I have been a general
    clerk in a village store, and am familiar with simple
    book-keeping, which would probably enable me to learn
    the work of a shipping clerk in a reasonable length of
    time.

    In case you should wish to engage me on trial, I would
    gladly assist, without compensation, your present clerk
    until the end of his engagement, which, I understand,
    is about three weeks from date.

    My present employer is Mr. G. W. Webster, of this
    place, and he will doubtless answer any inquiries
    concerning my work that you may address him.

                                  Respectfully,
                                       GEO. E. JOHNSON.

Such letters should always contain a stamp for a reply. The stamp is
attached by its corner or by a pin to the head of the letter.

Great precaution should always be taken not to send a letter with
insufficient postage on it; for the additional postage is collected
from the person to whom the letter is sent, and many business men look
upon such neglect as inexcusable, if they do not consider it dishonest,
inasmuch as it compels others to pay what the writer should have known
it was his duty to pay.

An application for a position as teacher in a public school is often
very difficult to write, because it is necessary to say much, and to
say it, in some cases, to men who are not thoroughly familiar with
business principles.

Before giving any forms, some suggestions which experience has taught
may be of great importance. The handwriting should be natural. If one
has a degree, he should not sign his name with it, but state in his
letter that he is a graduate, naming the institution from which he was
graduated. All boasting should be avoided. One should not ask a reply
by return mail, but he might enclose a postal card or a stamp with a
request to be informed when the board meets to consider applications.
One ought not to name as references persons who know nothing about his
work; for although they may, if consulted, endeavor to praise him,
they will show their ignorance of what he has done, and the board will
naturally assume that he has no better references.

As a rule it is not advisable to give testimonials from ministers or
from county superintendents, unless the writers can say that they are
familiar with the teacher’s work, and have visited his school. Very
old testimonials should not be placed before a board. Indeed, it is
doubtful whether any testimonial, unless it comes from a competent
judge, is of value.

If boards would consult one’s references, or seek information from
outside sources, it would be only just to all concerned; but as they
will not often do this, it is wise to send copies of two or three,
generally not more, good testimonials, and to have one or two of the
applicant’s friends write the board in his behalf.

A letter of application, especially if for the position of
superintendent or that of principal, should be full and explicit,
specifying the opportunities the writer has had to prepare himself for
the position, rather than stating that he has done so-and-so, for in
the latter case it might seem like boasting.

Sometimes a short letter, unless circumstances demand a long one, will
be most favorably received by a board. The writer once knew a very
important position to be obtained by a correspondence about as follows
(names of places, dates, etc., are omitted):

    TO THE HONORABLE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

    _Gentlemen:_

    I learn through a friend in your county, that the
    position of superintendent of your school is vacant.
    If the position has not been filled, I desire to make
    application for the same. I am a graduate of ————, and
    have taught three years. I am now principal of the ————
    schools, but desire to teach in your State, as my home
    is there.

                               Respectfully,
                                       —————————

A stamp was enclosed for a reply. The secretary of the board at once
wrote asking for references and stating the salary paid. The applicant
replied that he did not wish the position at the salary named, and
thanked the secretary for the trouble he had been given.

Had the applicant written a long letter, setting forth the value of his
services, and urging the board to raise the salary, it is not probable
that a reply would have been received by him. The simple statement that
he did not want the position at the salary named, was evidence to the
board that he considered his services worth more, and, moreover, that
he had confidence that he would command more. The secretary replied
to the last short note, asking for references and at what salary he
would accept the position. The information was given, and in a few days
the applicant was requested to meet the board with the assurance that
the position would be given him if the interview proved satisfactory,
which it did. Afterwards the applicant was informed by the president of
the board that his short business-like letters, written in an almost
illegible but natural hand, obtained for him the place over nearly
one hundred applicants, many of whom were college graduates of long
experience in teaching, and who had basketfuls of testimonials, but not
one of whom had written even a fairly good letter of application.

Many cities and towns have stated public examinations, which applicants
must attend before they can be employed.

The impression of character and of qualification produced by a personal
interview is deemed so important that even minor appointments are
scarcely given to any one not personally known to one of the school
board, or to some one in whose professional judgment they have great
confidence.

Preliminary inquiries about positions are most profitably made through
acquaintances, who can advise one whether to take any further steps.
One might write as follows:

                            Chicago, Ill., Nov. 3, 1899.

    _My Dear Friend:_

    May I trouble you to ascertain whether there is any
    vacancy in the schools at Elgin, to which I would have
    any prospect of an appointment? You will confer a great
    favor upon me if you will ask the superintendent,
    and let me know soon what he says. You can say to
    him that after I finished the high school course at
    Racine, I taught a term in a district school in Racine
    County, Wis., and was one year in charge of a primary
    department at Woodstock, and that I had charge of the
    grammar department at the latter place last year.

    You know something of the work I have done, and I can
    furnish testimonials from the school officers where I
    have taught.

                              Yours very truly,
                                        EMMA C. BOWEN.

If a favorable answer is received, something like the following form
may be used, which is also a form suitable to make application where
one is already acquainted, and where formal applications are expected.

                       Chicago, Ill., Jan. 10, 1899.

    MR. C. E. RYAN,
          Supt. of Public Schools,
                           Elgin, Ill.

    _Dear Sir:_

    I desire to obtain a position in the schools of your
    city. I enclose a letter from Mr. Henry Jones, a
    director of Woodstock, where I last taught; and I
    refer you to Mrs. Mary Smith, of Elgin. I prefer the
    intermediate work, but would not object to any position
    that I may be able to fill.

    I completed the course in the Racine High School, and
    have taught a little more than two years, first in
    a country school, then in a primary school a year at
    Woodstock, where I afterward had charge of the grammar
    room for a year.

    Please inform me when and by whom candidates are
    examined, as well as what vacancies there are, and be
    kind enough to make any suggestions that you think will
    be helpful to me.

                        Very respectfully,
                               (Miss) EMMA C. BOWEN.

CHAPTER XI.

GENERAL HINTS.

    We remain shackled by timidity till we have learned to
    speak and act with propriety.—_Samuel Johnson._


A man raises his hat when walking with another, not only to his own
acquaintances, but to those persons who bow to his companion, whether
he is acquainted with them or not.

If a man meets a woman in a hotel corridor or hall he should step
aside, allowing her to pass, and raising his hat.

If in a public place a man hands a woman anything she has dropped, he
should raise his hat when offering it to her. A well-bred man raises
his hat after passing the fare of a woman in a car or coach. This does
not mean that he has any desire to become acquainted with her, but it
is his tribute to her sex.

Slight inaccuracies in statements should not be corrected in the
presence of others.

One should give her children, unless married, their Christian names
only, or say “my daughter” or “my son,” in speaking of them to anyone
excepting servants.

Men remove their hats when in elevators in the presence of women.

Men having occasion to pass before women seated in lecture and concert
rooms, and all other places, should “beg pardon,” and pass with their
faces, and not their backs, toward them.

In going up or down stairs, a man precedes a woman or walks by her side.

To indulge in ridicule of another, whether the subject be present or
absent, is to descend below the level of gentlemanly propriety.

A reverence for religious observances and religious opinions is a
distinguishing trait of a refined mind.

Religious topics should be avoided in conversation, except where all
are prepared to concur in a respectful treatment of the subject. In
mixed societies the subject should never be introduced.

Frequent consultation of the watch or time-piece is impolite, either
when at home or abroad. If at home, it appears as if one were tired
of the company and wished them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours
dragged heavily, and one were calculating how soon he would be released.

It is very unbecoming to exhibit petulance or angry feeling, though it
is indulged in largely in almost every circle. The true gentleman does
not suffer his countenance to be easily ruffled.

The right of privacy is sacred, and should always be respected. It
is exceedingly improper to enter a private room without knocking. No
relation, however intimate, will justify an abrupt intrusion upon a
private apartment. Likewise the trunk, boxes, packets, papers, or
letters of any individual, locked or unlocked, sealed or unsealed,
are sacred. It is ill-mannered even to open a book-case, or to read a
written paper lying open, without permission, expressed or implied.

Members of the same family should never differ with each other in
public.

One should never appear to be thinking of his own personal rights to
the resenting of a little slight, whether real or imaginary.

In small communities where near neighbors, for convenience’s sake,
borrow back and forth, great care should be taken that the practice
does not become a nuisance, as it surely does when it is indulged in
too frequently, and when borrowed articles are not speedily returned
and in good condition. There should be no stinted measures in returning.

Ostentation is snobbish, as is all too great profusion.

To affect not to remember a person is despicable, and reflects only on
the pretender.

Some conceited or ill-bred people imagine they make themselves
important and powerful by being rude and insulting.

One is judged, to a great extent, by the character of his associates.

One should be very careful how he asks for the loan of a book. If
interest is shown in one, its owner will offer it for perusal if
willing to lend it. When reading a borrowed book, one should take the
best of care of it, and return it as soon as possible. No real lady
or gentlemen will leave finger prints upon its pages, or turn down
its leaves in place of a book-mark, or scribble in it with a pencil,
or loan it to a third person without the knowledge and consent of the
owner.

A lack of reverence in one in the house of God, implies low parentage,
or a coarse nature that is not subject to refinement.

To whisper and laugh during any public entertainment proclaims one’s
ill-breeding, and invades the rights of others.

One ought never to leave the house after the evening’s entertainment
without bidding the hostess good-night, and acknowledging the pleasure
the evening has afforded him.

The business man has no stock-in-trade that pays him better than a good
address.

It is only those persons and families whose position is not a secure
one, that are afraid to be seen outside their own social circle.

One should never reprove servants or children before strangers.

A true lady will not betray her astonishment at any violation of
conventional rules, least of all will she make it her province to
punish those who may make any such violation.

If one, on meeting another, fails to recall the name, he should frankly
say so.

One should never recall himself to the recollection of a casual
acquaintance without at the same time mentioning his name.

In a flat-house a man should take his hat and coat into the apartment
where he is going to call, and not leave them in the hall on the first
floor.

It is very bad taste, even in quite a large party, for young girls to
visit a man at his office.

It is perfectly good form for a mother to invite to a little child’s
party children whose parents she does not know, or who have not yet
called upon her. The invitations go out in the child’s name and to the
child’s friends.

It is extremely rude and ill-bred, when at a boarding-house or hotel
table, to criticise the food that is served. The fact that it is paid
for makes it none the less an evidence of bad manners. People who are
not satisfied where they are boarding should always leave; they have no
right to make others uncomfortable by their lack of good-breeding.

Women of good-breeding do not permit themselves to “overlook” those to
whom courtesies are due.

A man should learn to put his coat on in a public place of
entertainment so that he will not require assistance from the woman who
is with him.

The young woman to whom a seat is offered should take it, unless her
companion is an older woman, when it would be quite proper to extend
the courtesy to her.

It is very bad taste, even for a frolic, for a young girl to assume
boy’s clothes, or get herself up in any way that will tend to make
herself look masculine.

There is no impropriety in giving to those men friends with whom one is
well acquainted, some trifling souvenir at Christmas or Easter, or on
birthdays.

It is customary for a young man to send a young woman only such gifts
as flowers, candy, and books; and as these presents are sent merely
as a slight return for her hospitality and invitations to her house,
etc., it is not necessary for her to send him any gift in return. If,
however, a young woman and man are on intimate enough terms to exchange
presents, she may send him any small article for the desk or toilet;
such as a silver-handled whisk broom, court-plaster case, pen-wiper,
paper-cutter, or books, which are a good present and always acceptable
to any one.

Nothing looks more ill-bred than to see a young man, under his parents’
roof, devoting himself during a whole evening entirely to one young
woman to the ignoring of the others.

A man who is escorting two women in the street should not walk between
them, but on the outside of both near the curb; at the theater or at
any place of amusement or at church, he should sit nearest to the
aisle, at the side of one of them.

Unless there is some good reason why she needs his support, a man
seldom offers his arm to a woman he escorts, even in the evening. A
husband may offer his arm to his wife, of course, and a man may proffer
this help to an invalid or aged person.

A little delicate perfume may be used with propriety, but a heavy
perfume, and one that scents the entire room in which the person who
uses it happens to be, is in very bad form.

In opening a door from the hall to the drawing-room, a man should hold
it while a woman precedes him in entering.

When one’s pardon is asked for some slight inattention, an inclination
of the head and a smile is the best answer.

The words “gentleman friend” and “lady friend” have been so vulgarized
that most well-bred women now say “man friend” or “woman friend,” it
being taken for granted that they number among their friends only
ladies and gentlemen.

Custom never condones liberties, no matter how slight, between young
men and women.

When a woman is visiting, any acquaintance who should call upon her
should also ask for her hostess, and if she is absent leave a card for
her.

It is considered very bad taste for a young girl to address a man with
whom her acquaintance is but slight by his Christian name.

No young man has any right to spend the entire afternoon and evening
every Sunday at one particular house, to the annoyance of an entire
family, who do not like to make him conscious of the fact that they
consider him a bore.

When a young man is paying a visit, and the older members of the family
are in the room, he should, in leaving, bid them good-night first, and
afterward say his farewell to the young girl on whom he has called. It
is in bad taste for her to go any further than the parlor door with him.

Even if a correspondence is of a “purely friendly character,” it should
not exist between a married woman and a young man, or between a married
man and a young woman.

It is not good taste to ask one’s men friends to buy tickets for
charity affairs. They do not like to refuse, and very often, though the
sum required may be small, they cannot afford it.

There is very great harm in young girls meeting young men in
secret; the men will have no respect for the girls, and nothing but
mortification for the girls will be the result.

It is quite proper to thank any public servant, such as a railroad
conductor, for any information he may give, but it is not necessary to
be effusive about it.

It is not in good taste, nor even proper, for young women to go alone
to a hotel to dine with a man.

When a girl is young and pretty, a Platonic friendship is very
difficult to keep up.

When a man friend has driven a woman in town to go to church he should
take her direct to the church and leave her there while he drives where
his carriage and horses are to wait until after the service. Of course
he would walk to church and join her there.

It is not in good taste for different members of a party to go off in
pairs, and spend the evening alone on the seashore.

It is not wise for a young woman and young man living in the same city
to correspond. If meeting each other often they ought to be able to say
all that is necessary.

One has no right whatever to read a postal card addressed to another
without permission.

The very minute the married man begins to tell of his wife’s faults,
the time has come to cut his acquaintance.

It is more than wrong for a young girl to receive visits from a married
man.

In entering any public place a woman should precede a man, but going
down the aisle, the usher, of course, would precede her.

A hostess stands to receive her visitors, but she does not advance to
meet them unless the visitor should be some one quite old or of such
importance that the visit is of great honor. The hostess extends her
hand to the men who call, as well as to the women.

A woman is not supposed to recognize a man who is one of a group
standing in a public place, since a modest girl will not look close
enough at a group of men to recognize an acquaintance.

No matter how well a woman may know a man, it would be in very bad form
to send him an invitation which does not include his wife, unless it
should be at some affair at which only men are to be present.

A man should show as much courtesy to a woman in his employ as he does
to the women he meets in social life.

It is not in good taste to visit at the home of one’s betrothed, unless
a personal invitation is received from his mother.

Two women may attend, with perfect propriety, a place of amusement
without an escort. They should be, however, under such circumstances,
exceptionally quiet in their manners and their dress.

In escorting a young woman home, a man should go up the steps with her,
wait until the door is opened, and, as she enters the house, raise his
hat and say good-night.

If a young girl were very ill, there would be no impropriety in her
mother bringing her betrothed to see her, although, of course, she
would remain in the room during his visit.

It is always proper and courteous for a person in church to share
either prayer-book or hymnal with anyone who may be without either.

There is no impropriety in a woman’s permitting a man friend to assist
her in putting on her over-shoes.

If one approves of the acting or the sentiment of the play, there is no
impropriety in expressing gentle applause, but a loud clapping of the
hands is decidedly vulgar.

One should never prevent people from leaving his house when they
desire. That is not hospitality. It is tyranny; it is taking a mean
advantage of their unwillingness to offend.

If a women lives in a boarding house and has only one room, it would
be very bad taste to receive any man visitor there. Even if it is not
quite so agreeable, they should be received in the public parlor.

When a man and woman approach a hostess together, the hostess should
shake hands with the woman first.

When a man calls on a woman, he shakes hands with her on his arrival;
but, unless he is very intimate in the house, a simple bow is
sufficient when he leaves.

An unmarried woman writing her name in a hotel register should prefix
it with “Miss” in parentheses.

When a man friend has taken a lady to a concert, she should thank him
for his kindness in having given her a pleasant evening.

It is not advisable for a girl to deliberately “cut” any man. If
she wishes to discontinue her acquaintance with a man whom she
cannot respect, it may be done gradually, at first by the coolest of
greetings; then, by a look in the other direction; and in time all
recognition will cease.

If a stranger takes occasion to be polite to one during a street-car
accident, all that is necessary is a polite “thank you.”

When a man who is to escort a girl to an entertainment calls for her at
her own home, it is proper for her to appear with her wraps on, and be
ready to start at once.

If a man is courteous enough to open the door of a store or any public
building for a woman, she should thank him.

If a girl of sixteen goes to an evening affair, her mother should
arrange to have either a servant or a member of the family go after her
to bring her home.

If the hostess opens the door for a man caller, she should precede him
in entering the parlor.

After having taken a meal or having received any other kind of
entertainment at a private house, before leaving a guest should express
his thanks, or, rather his enjoyment, of the same to the hostess. This
courtesy from a young man or girl is very acceptable to elderly ladies.

Queen Victoria has forgiven certain breaches of etiquette made in
ignorance, and left her guest to discover the mistake at another time.
It is a reprehensible host indeed who does otherwise, and so makes a
guest uncomfortable. Etiquette is all wrong and false when it makes one
forget the higher laws of courtesy or hospitality.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  Notes and a terminal Essay on the Manners
  and Customs of Beavering Men_

  LONDON:

  T. WERNER LAURIE, LTD.

  30, NEW BRIDGE STREET, E.C. 4




A.

IS AN ADMIRAL-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Admiral-Beaver]

The specimen mounted is typical and the coat is good, harsh and not
silky, a common fault in these rough-haired examples.

An Admiral-King-Beaver is unthinkable ... “derogation of God’s honour,”
etc.

Though the sport is deservedly popular in the Service, it is attended
by infinite risk should the specimen be of higher rank than the
players. K. R. and A. I. contain no definite ruling as to the legality
or otherwise of the game, but a Court-Martial would probably trip an
unlucky player on “conduct to the prejudice,” etc.

In civil life (and plain clothes) it is most unusual to be able to
score these specimens, hence the different values of Rear-Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, etc., is not given, nor those of the various branches of
the Service, Executive, Engineer, and the like.




B.

IS A BALD-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Bald-King-Beaver]

That depicted is a magnificent specimen in full winter-coat.

They are not common, but occur frequently--the apparent paradox is
explained by the fact that they are usually of an extremely retiring
nature, and reside by choice in coigns and nooks.

For a specimen such as that mounted game should be claimed and nothing
under three points accepted; rather call off the match and communicate
with the Association.

In scoring really fine specimens in full winter-coat extra points can,
and should be, claimed for purity of tint, bushiness, etc.




C.

IS A CENTAUR-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Centaur-King-Beaver]

There is no record of a specimen being scored. Probably the last
person to do so may have been Jason. The best authorities assume this,
adducing as contributory evidence his later, passionate quest of the
Golden Fleece. Ourselves we regard it as more likely that Chiron was
never scored, Jason being held back by the natural delicacy of one
_in statu pupillari_. In fact, Chiron was, almost certainly, a “local
double-fault.”




D.

IS A DOUBLE-FAULT.


[Illustration: Double-Fault]

This question is dealt with in the terminal essay.

The specimen is a good one, and no player who is deceived by a growth
of this kind need feel the smallest depression. It is the kind of thing
that might happen to anyone.

A young specimen, darker than dark brindle, has, I believe, never been
scored.




E.

IS AN ECCLESIASTICAL-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Ecclesiastical-King-Beaver]

Rare in general, there are frequently to be found in Cathedral cities
large coveys, not very strong on the wing.

Local rules should be consulted as to the scoring. Fine specimens count
at least three points.

I myself, recently, claimed an Ecclesiastical-King, in a country town,
and was awarded two games for it; a well-known local rarity of which
the place is justly proud.

It was a superb specimen, in good coat, a darkish brindle, and in
official robes.




F.

IS A FRINGED-GEORGIC-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Fringed-Georgic-Beaver]

The species is less common than formerly. Some purists refuse to score
these Fringed-Georgics on the plea that the upper lip is bare and the
_chin_ partially bare and that they are, therefore, double-faults. The
general ruling is that as the adornment _circumnavigates_ the face the
chin is not bare, the bareness of the upper lip is immaterial and the
specimen should be scored; one point in the country, three points in
London.




G.

IS A GALLIC-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration Gallic-King-Beaver]

The game is almost unplayable in France. Owing to the superabundance of
specimens only rarities should be scored.

A report has just been received from Cap D’Antibes of a “magnificent
Wasp-Waisted-King.” Game was called. No information was sent
(correspondents are deplorably slack) as to colour or coat.

Good players, in France, lay great stress on minute differences in
colour and characteristic, _i.e._, crimped, curled, waved, rat-tail,
wuzzy, wild-garden, etc.




H.

IS A HALF-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Half-Beaver]

These delightful specimens are now, unhappily, becoming very rare.

They are still occasionally scored in the neighbourhood of places of
worship and on the seashore.

Some claim increased points in ratio to the length of the upper lip.

The specimen mounted (Stockton-on-Tees, 1919), is a fine one,
exhibiting all the marked features of the _genus_, including a most
gratifying labial expanse.




I.

IS AN IMPERIAL-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Imperial-Beaver]

Not common in England; when scored in this country are almost
invariably migrants.

These amusing specimens are, curiously enough, commoner in winter-coat
than in ordinary plumage.

There are no tricks about scoring an Imperial. Any specimen with
moustache and a growth beneath the lower lip, of which the parent area
does not extend to the lower edge of the chin, is an Imperial.

Score three points for a Full-Black; one point for a White.




J.

IS A JOO BEAVER.


[Illustration: Joo Beaver]

These exotics are fairly common, and local sportsmen can be relied
upon to flush a few on short notice, provided that they are allowed to
choose the beat.

In many ways curiously attractive, the charm of the species is marred
by the frequent lack of neatness of plumage; as a race they incline to
landscape-gardening with their hirsuteness.

Carefully note their musical cry of “Oy-Yoy ... Oy Yoy.” A specimen in
full song, when the moon is full, counts game.

Some experts have a very nice scale--by which they score--of the
curvilinear bill. This is a pretty point and a pleasant _raffinement_,
but too subtle for the ordinary week-end player. Of course any
unusually fine frontal curve should be claimed and scored as a rarity.




K.

IS A KILLINGWORTH-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Killingworth-Beaver]

This specimen is mounted for instructional purposes only. Connoisseurs
and collectors are, of course, entirely _au fait_ with the
deliciousness of this gorgeous creature.

George Killingworth, in the year 1555, was sent to the court of Ivan
the Terrible (one of the many monarchs who have, from time to time,
taxed Beavers) as the agent of Queen Mary. His beard was five feet
two inches in length and it was yellow. He was without doubt the most
flawless specimen of a Yellow-King ever seen.

It is considered in the highest degree unlikely that anything
approaching this efflorescence will be noted nowadays, hence no score
is suggested.




L.

IS A LICKED-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Licked-Beaver]

It is worthy of remark in passing that this distinguishing title is due
to the genius of a child--“trailing clouds,” etc.--who, on observing
the first specimen ever scored, cried, “Oh, look; he’s licked it.”

The species is very rare. Off-shoots of the old stock, in the form
of Semi-Walruses, are occasionally observed, but the Licked-Beaver
is generally regarded as almost extinct. Possibly the cause of this
diminution, if not extinction, may be the increase in the cost of
living.

The specimen mounted is a very fine one. Should a player have the good
fortune to score a Licked-Beaver, let him remember that it is the
density of the licking, the spear-form, the sharpness, that should be
regarded rather than the length of the portion licked.




M.

IS A MANDARIN-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Mandarin-Beaver]

Even in plain clothes should score two games if seen in England. There
is no ruling as to the points to be scored if observed in this country
in full plumage.

This specimen is often wrongly catalogued in books of reference as a
Mandarin-King-Beaver. Royalty or Kinghood is impossible for a species
which supports a very notable gap between its central adornment and the
maxillary-fringes.

The specimen mounted is, so to say, traditional, that is, it is a
transcript of an early-nineteenth century Chinese brush-drawing on silk
in Chinese ink representing a hero, or as we should say, a Beaver.




N.

IS A NANNY-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Nanny-Beaver]

Really good specimens are very rare. They are reported to flourish in
the Eastern farming states of the United States of America, but British
research is lamentably behindhand, and our exact knowledge is quite
fragmentary.

In any case there is one simple rule for the guidance of the _amateur_;
no Nanny-Beaver can be claimed or scored of which the adornment does
not depend a full two inches from the under-surface of the chin.




O.

IS AN ORIENTAL-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Oriental-Beaver]

These strangely beautiful specimens are rarely seen in this cold
country.

Those who have had the privilege of observing closely a gaggle of
Orientals in indigenous plumage (the species is pathetically subject to
local changes) will, assuredly, ever prize the recollection.

The most noteworthy feature, apart from the extraordinarily fine
quality of coat (glossiness, sheen, etc.), is the exotic parting
which lends a wistful charm to the otherwise opulent glories of these
occasional visitors.

Score always two games (in England); set, if the specimen is in
indigenous plumage.




P.

IS A PARTI-COLOUR-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Parti-Colour-Beaver]

These specimens are curiously attractive and are more often scored than
one would think. Artists, above all others, wax well-nigh lyrical over
the beauties of a well-defined Parti-Colour, one, that is, in which
there is almost no shading, the black being black and the white, white.
The same colouration is observed in the pelt of the Colobus monkey and
justly admired.

It is not possible to distinguish between natural and artificial
Parti-Colours, unless one should happen to be a relative of the
specimen. All Parti-Colours are, therefore, scored. (Two points.)




Q.

IS A QUEEN-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Queen-Beaver]

It has been objected that it is not gallant to score these undoubted
rarities. Theoretically it is, certainly, not pretty conduct, but, on
the other hand, all is fair in love and war, and ... has any man ever
refused to shoot a rhinoceros on the plea that it was a female? (I
merely ask ... someone may have done so. There may even be a close time
for doe-rhinoes.) Be that as it may, the scoring of Queens is an affair
of lineage. Regard this eighteenth century distich:--

    “Here is a Pink-Queen, very rare,
    Remember to count the sixteenth hair.”[1]

Queens are always scored extravagantly. Usually game; extra-rarities
two games, and so on. The Pink-Queen is, without doubt, the rarest of
her kind; conversely, when found, she is usually a superb specimen, in
rich coat. The question of Queens is dealt with broadly in the terminal
essay.

[Footnote 1: Queens cannot be scored unless they have _more_ than
fifteen hairs.]




R.

IS A RED-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Red-King-Beaver]

I feel a very natural emotion on commenting on the sublime specimen
of the Red-King, the ultimate hope of every keen collector, which
is portrayed on the opposite page. Observed outside “The Goose and
Gridiron,” in Slogsby-under-Hill, this noble creature deprived both my
companion (an ex-local champion) and myself of speech for three minutes.

Had he been carrying a ladder (the _ne-plus-ultra_ of Beaverhood) we
had never recovered from the glory of the revelation.

Red-Kings score “Game, set, match.” A Red-King on a green bicycle,
carrying a lanthorn (or lantern), scores do. do. “Local Championship.”
A Red-King on a green bicycle carrying a ladder (poor old Pelion!) has
never, alas! been reported up to the present.

There are dreams of scoring a Red-King, complete with fitments, on a
High Bicycle ... all things are possible, even a ravishment such as
that.




S.

IS A SANTA-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Santa-Beaver]

These are usually scored, though your conscientious expert demurs at so
doing, as it has been held--and the view is well supported by players
of repute--that they are strictly-speaking Double-Faults, the adornment
being temporary.

The genuine Santa-King-Beaver, complete with reindeer, sleigh and
business with chimney, has never, I believe, been scored.

Claim a game if you, a stranger adult, score one.




T.

IS A TUFTED-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Tufted-King-Beaver]

It may, perhaps, be thought that this is a fanciful, a pernickety
differentiation--such are to be deplored--but there is a very
distinct species of Beaver--King or ordinary--having these marked
characteristics, and the best players invariably claim a Tufted, and
two points, if they have the luck to espy a specimen such as that
depicted.

The points to look for are the three patches of foliage in centre
forehead and over either ear. The chin-growth partakes of the nature of
these, but it is the _tufted temple_ which makes your rarity.

In the last century this sub-branch of the genus Longi-Florum was
fairly common; sub-title, Adolphus.




U.

IS AN URSINE-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Ursine-Beaver]

The specimen mounted is, I believe, unique. A noted scientist in
private life, in public life an exquisite Ursine--or (as some say)
Leonine--there are no _data_ extant to assist us in forming an opinion
as to why he did it.

It is scarcely likely that this phenomenon will flower again for
centuries. Should a pale reflection be observed, remember that the
salient points are: (a.) great width across the cheek-bones, (b.)
uniformity of foliage.

The miracle mounted opposite had tendrils, delicate, wonderful, almost
on the lower edge of the eye-lids.

The osseous formation of the nasal promonotory should be carefully
studied by earnest _amateurs_.




V.

IS A VAN DYCK-BEAVER.


[Illustration Van Dyck-Beaver]

Mounted as an historical curiosity: they are now extinct.

In full bloom they were, I am told, very beautiful. The finest
specimens had _never_ shaved, hence the coat was a miracle of gloss,
softness, shimmer and silk.

Should anything, _anything_ approaching this shape be observed, kindly
write at once to the Association, who are only too anxious to catalogue
every rarity.

Disregard cropped hair. One dare not hope for a modern specimen in
trailing-coat.




W.

IS A WALRUS.


[Illustration: Walrus]

These cannot be scored when playing Beaver.

A debased form of the game called “Walrus” is--actually--played, and,
occasionally, mixed Walrus and Beaver. The Walrus game usually ends in
an unseemly wrangle, owing to the intense difficulty in deciding on the
exact status of the specimen.

The specimen mounted is almost perfect--perhaps it is a thought
regular--it was observed in 1922 in Knightsbridge; the neat bow-tie was
pale blue satin, almost certainly attached by a brass clip.




X.

IS A XANTHINE-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Xanthine-King-Beaver]

These specimens are only scored by specialists.

There is a perfectly distinct difference between a Xanthine, a Red
and a Yellow, but it is very small, and to mark it requires a very
nicely-trained eye. Xanthines are usually rather bewildered-looking,
and are remarkable, in general, for profusion of crop and coarseness of
coat.

The habit of insisting on minute colour-niceties is to be deplored as
tending to debase the sport to the level of the philatelist’s “rose-red
on carmine,” “carmine on rose-red.”




Y.

IS A YELLOW-KING.


[Illustration: Yellow-King]

Excessively rare.

With the exception of George Killingworth, cited on page 25, the
most notable Yellow-King of whom we have record is Leo Vincey, the
superlative Beaver who went, in company with his dark-brindle guardian,
Mr. Holly, in search of “She” ... or should it be “Her”?

There is no record in office of a Yellow-King having been scored in the
last eleven years. They are seen occasionally in France, and there are
vague rumours that a certain number are bagged yearly in Germany.

Claim extravagant points if you have the fortune to light upon one.
Here again sheen is most important, and the coat should be fine, soft
and silky.




Z.

IS A ZEBRA-KING-BEAVER.


[Illustration: Zebra-King-Beaver]

Excessively rare.

I, myself, have once scored a Zebra-King, but it was, and is, the only
specimen of which I have heard, and it is greatly prized locally.

The colour-demarcation must be very obvious before one can claim a
Zebra. There is as much difference between a Yellow and a Red-King as
there is between a Zebra and a Brindle.

The King illustrated is--I speak without fear of being
contradicted--literally unique. In superb coat, ideal shape of
attachment, in colour--a greenish tabby with dark markings, the Zebra
I have the pleasure of showing you represents the _ne-plus-ultra_ of
rarity.

He thus forms a fitting, as it were, _cul-de-lampe_ to my “littel”
guide.




TERMINAL ESSAY ON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF BEAVERING MEN.


Proem.

Adam, according to tradition, was created in full King-Beaverhood, and,
burgeoning amid the bougainvillea and borage of the Garden of Eden,
the Beard, throughout the centuries, has bloomed and faded, resurged,
again faded, then blossomed anew that, in the fullness of time, the
Beard-Bearer might be crowned with the honourable title of Beaver.
“The soft susurrus of his silken stride” brings joy to the heart of
man, perhaps also “game, set, match,” and the shape, the colour, the
texture of his adornment provoke a fastidious scrutiny akin to that of
a connoisseur appraising a Crown Derby figurine. For many years the
auburn-haired hero who grew a beard was not, _ipso facto_, a person of
any importance. A dignitary of the Church, whose venerable features
were complemented or obscured by a snowy, a grizzled or a brindled
beard of majestic length, was not, inherently, remarkable. Behold them
now, a Red-King and an Ecclesiastical King, cynosures, orchids upon
the unlovely tree-trunk of our common life. As the poet might have
written:--

    Beaver, beaver, burning bright,
    In what forest of the night,
    What immortal hand or eye
    Could frame thy xanthine symmetry?


The Beaver in History.

The celebrated Beavers of history need not be catalogued at length.
Shakespeare was a Bald-Beaver, apparently an Anticipatory-Vandyke.
Napoleon Bonaparte was not a Beaver. Julius Cæsar, Edward Gibbon, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Alexander VI. and Beethoven did all “... against the
edicts of God, the oracles of the Prophets, the placits of councils
and the judgment of learned men, hold fast the foolish custom of
shaving.”[2] Contrariwise, Hannibal, William Morris, Rodin, St.
Paul and Juan Rodriguez de Silva z Vélasquez were all content with
“nourishing their horrid bushes of vanity.”[3] The Jews bore their
beards proudly from out the Captivity. Indeed they took captivity
captive; did not the Egyptians from time to time, asserting their
masculinity, assume ceremonial false beards, “double faults” to a man?
The most antient Romans were King-Beavers; the Normans were Walruses;
the Greeks supported a considerable number of King-Beavers, among them
Pericles and Socrates, “shaving was very rare in the early part of our
period (440 B.C.–330 B.C.).”[4] Until the eighteenth century Beaverhood
was common, since that time it has grown rarer and rarer, with a sudden
uprush of fur to the face in the middle of the last century, an uprush
which has now almost died away. We read “... the value of their fur
has caused their destruction in great measure where they were once
numerous, and has led to their extirpation where there is evidence that
they existed as a not uncommon animal. They were formerly distributed
over the greater part of Europe. In England semi-fossilised remains
show that they were not uncommon ... in 1188 Giraldus stated that they
were living on the river Teify in Cardiganshire ... some were known to
frequent the Elbe in 1878.”[5]

[Footnote 2: Bulwer. _Anthropometamorphosis_ (1650).]

[Footnote 3: Dr. Bolton.]

[Footnote 4: Tucker, _Life in Ancient Athens_, p. 83.]

[Footnote 5: _Living Animals of the World_, vol. I., p. 152 _et seq._
_Parts of this extract are not clear. What value has the pelt of the
Red-King commercially? Can a tippet be made of the adornment of the
Fringed-Georgic?_]


THE GAME.

Origin.

The origin of the game, which is scored in exactly the same manner as
Lawn Tennis, is unknown. There are, however, various theories; one
school holds that it came to birth in Oxford, another that it emerged
in the other place, and a third traces it to Malta (where “my brother
from Gozo” was, doubtless, a local champion) and seeks for some
association with antient mysteries.

The outlines of the game itself are so simple and well-defined that the
question of rules scarcely arises. A bearded man is a Beaver, claim
him, crying aloud, as musically as possible, “Beaver, fifteen love”--or
appropriately to the score. If both players cry aloud simultaneously it
is a “no-ball.”


Double Faults.

The system of “double faults” deserves explanation. The educational
value of the game is high, fostering as it does quickness of
observation and that desirable attribute, an eagle-glance. When a
player has had some little practice he will often score winning points
from behind the specimen. Thus a side-whiskered gentleman may be
claimed from the rear but, on drawing level with the quarry, it is
observed that the chin is bare ... double fault.


Local Double Faults.

“Local double faults” are always a matter of courtesy, and if one
claims a “local D. F.” one is not mulcted in the point. Usually it
is some revered and Friend-of-all-the-World Beaver who is created,
by general consent, a “local D. F.,” to enable players to discuss,
unembarrassed, the day’s sport with him. Juvenile players find this
convention of the greatest possible service. Hot-tempered, hard-handed
uncles and such like are swiftly appeased by being made “local D. F.s,”
and join whole-heartedly in the triumph occasioned by the capture of
some other Brindled-King.


Status of Beaver.

It has been mentioned in the notes that very high standards have been
from time to time set up as regards the status of Beaver. Passionate
purists have, indeed, claimed that the charming Half-Beaver is a D. F.,
that the delicate wilding, the Fringed-Georgic, is a D. F., even that
the Imperial and the Nanny are suspect. Heed not such persons. Remember
Knut and Mrs. Partington, nor seek to gild the lily. The sign manual
of the Beaver is the not-naked chin, ἂγυμνος. No one of the specimens
mentioned above has a naked chin, therefore, they are all Beavers;
_quod erat demonstrandum_.


Hints as to Habitat.

The game can be played anywhere, except in Burithabeth, for “these men
have no beards at all, for we saw them carry a certain iron instrument
in their hands wherewith, if any hairs grow upon their chin, they
presently pluck them out.”[6] Cathedral cities are a favourite habitat
of the _genus_, and some are always to be found in the neighbourhood
of Pall Mall. Dockyard towns provide large numbers of the ordinary
variety, but very few Kings.

[Footnote 6: Mandeville.]


Single-handed Beaver.

It is not generally known that a rigidly conscientious person can play
single-handed Beaver with great content. One scores Beavers walking in
the same direction as oneself to the server, Beavers coming from that
direction, and so passing the player, to the striker and stationary
Beavers in accordance with the direction in which their heads are
turned, towards or away from the player. Beavers debouching suddenly
from cross-roads, if one has not time, as on a swift omnibus, to
observe their ultimate direction, are “no-balls.”


Objections to the Game.

It has been objected that the game is nonsensical, anti-social and
essentially discourteous. Nonsensical it is, an it please you; but
is not nonsense a rare and a precious thing? Is not the nonsense of
Lewis Carroll quite entirely adorable? Is not Lear’s story of Violet,
Slingsby, Guy and Lionel a thing of impressive beauty? The game is not
anti-social, for it entails an increased interest in and admiration of
one’s fellow-men and, as regards discourtesy, surely it is as much a
compliment to a Red-King to cry on him, “Beaver, game, set, match,” as
it is to comment upon some damsel’s handsome eyes.


The Beaver.

“Aristotle in his ethics takes up the conceit of the _Bever_,”[7]
and, in general, one may assume that the bearded are proud of their
adornments, love them, cherish them, even going so far in some cases
as to enclose them in silken bags before retiring to rest. Controversy
has long raged as to the propriety or otherwise of shaving. The Greek
Church held strong views on the point, “... and also they say, that
we sin deadly in shaving our beards, for the beard is token of a man,
and gift of our Lord.”[8] The antient Greeks, as we have observed, for
long clutched their hairiness, but finally succumbed to the Macedonian
mode, and shaved clean; it is an interesting point that they did
utterly abhor the Walrus. In England the matter has been entirely
regulated by fashion, and I cannot trace the existence of any important
body of opinion in favour of or against the practice of shaving. It
would, nevertheless, be safe to say that an immature Beaver in the
present year of grace is so rare as to be practically unknown--English
specimens are seldom lighter than medium-brindle--which shows the trend
of modern thought.

It may be accepted, then, that the Beaver indulges in efflorescence in
order to gratify his vanity (or in a few cases, perhaps, to keep his
throat warm and save the expense of cravats). Perhaps he remembers the
dictum, “_l’habit long et la barbe imposent de respect_.”[9] In which
connection it may be emphasised that the intense interest now taken in
fine specimens should be (and probably is) a source of considerable
gratification to them. I have even been told of one superb Red-King who
invariably congratulates the fortunate player who scores him.

[Footnote 7: Browne. _Pseudodoxia_, I., c. ix.]

[Footnote 8: Mandeville, c. iii.]

[Footnote 9: Voltaire, _Dict. Phil._]


Characteristics of various Species.

It is interesting to observe the very marked personal characteristics
of the various species. A Brindled-King-Beaver is commonly
distinguished by a dignified port and an air of profound weightiness.
In a Red-King something of wistful may be remarked, in a Xanthine
a touch, maybe, of bewilderment. Parti-colours are usually rather
bird-like (perhaps the unconscious influence of the wag-tail) and
Yellows are always pugnacious in appearance. The Fringed-Georgic smacks
of the soil, the Imperial of cafés with red velvet, the Bald-King of
the Reading-Room of the British Museum, the Tufted of antimaccassars
and bronze horrors wriggling under glass domes. But all, without
exception, carry an indefinable air of _exotisme_, a something that
raises them above the herd; they appear never natural products, always
“sports.”


The Queen-Beaver.

Of the Queen-Beaver it may be safely said that “the female of the
species is more deadly than the male.” A really fine Pink-Queen is
awe-inspiring, and a Grey-Queen infinitely terrifying. The dainty
Blonde-Queen (it is advisable to have two assessors, for the signs of
her beaverhood are “_plus follets, plus doux, plus imperceptibles_”[10]
than in any other species) has a sinister air; a Black-Queen suggests
“Macbeth.” It is curious to read that “in Cyprus the Goddess of Love
wore a beard.”[11] Queens are rare and no false gallantry should prevent
a player from scoring them whenever possible. It is, however, the mark
of the gentleman to claim them _sotto voce_, almost in a whisper.

[Footnote 10: Voltaire, _op. cit._]

[Footnote 11: Macrobius, _Saturn_, iii., 8.2.]


Personalia.

We have now examined the game briefly, investigated the
characteristics of the Beaver family, cast a rapid and perfunctory
glance at the Beaver in History (a subject deserving of a tome), and
suggested explanations that may be offered, a defence that may be
attempted, when a player is assailed by a non-player. “To beaver or not
to beaver, that is the question.” The decision must be taken; paltering
is no part of a man. Myself, I took it on the top of an omnibus outside
the Ritz, and I played a most excellent game with myself as far as St.
Mary Abbott’s.

Having set my hand to the plough I did not look back, but entered upon
the game in all seriousness. When Fortune appeared I did not give her
a chance to “present her bald noddle,” but I grabbed her firmly by the
forelock. Being from town I chanced upon a small _coterie_ of learned
enthusiasts, and much improved my game, as also my knowledge. The city
was a very warren of Beavers; most of my finest specimens were secured
there. Does not the mouth of every collector water on reading that I
scored--with two witnesses, one of whom viséd the prey--a glorious
Pink-Queen, leaning on a green bicycle outside the Post-Office? and,
subsequently, an American Grey-Queen with young? The only rarity,
roughly speaking, which eluded me was a fine Fringed-Georgic. I scored
a somewhat moth-eaten specimen of uncertain colouration. Thus, “on
stepping-stones of our dead” Beavers I attained to a certain skill.
It would have been impossible to choose a better place for my little
holiday, and my gratitude to my genial instructors and coaches knows no
bounds.

Local rules were well-framed, simple and reasonable. There are two
“local D. F.s,” easily recognisable, and a certain number of markedly
fine specimens which have great repute in the district and bear a
very high scoring-value. All unknowing I claimed and scored _the_
Ecclesiastical-King and was, instantly, awarded two games. It was, in
very truth, a noble creature, a Pointed-Brindle, which is, of course,
as rare and valuable as a pointed fox, in gorgeous coat and official
robes of a searching scarlet. I had the good fortune to secure also the
finest King in Full Winter-Coat that I have ever seen. The adornment
was almost incredibly bushy and “white as the neck of Lalage,” while
the specimen wore brown _suéde_ shoes. Heigh ho! for the brave days
that are dead. Golly, what a garland I wove me in that dear place.


Conclusion.

To what point are we come? Is the game of Beaver the expression of
a passionate mass-protest against the furred face, or is it the
forerunner of a revival of beards, that is, do we see here the shadow
of that antient custom which led peoples to sacrifice yearly the
animals who else were deities, whom they adored?[12] In any case the
Beard is again burgeoning. But a few years gone the bearded were not,
_qua_ beards, of any importance, now they loom upon the social horizon
considerably larger than a man’s hand. Of the importance of the Beard
it may well be that the apogee is upon us. Perchance the Beard will
again be invested with the dignity of ceremonial as in antient China.
“After the coffining,” so we read of the obsequies of an officer, “the
Master of the Ceremonies does away with his hair-tufts.”[13] Shall we
live to see the Beard exalted as an horn on high? Will the game of
Beaver re-instate the Beard as the Crimean campaign instituted the now
almost extinct (but exquisite) moustache-whisker fitment, or will it
drive the hairy to put off the whole armour of hairiness? _Quien sabe?_
These things remain, in the charming phrase of M. Cliché, “on the knees
of the gods,” but it is safe to assert that, even now, we can as a
people, we English, rebut the accusation of Samuel Butler, “we often do
not notice that a man has grown a beard.”[14]

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of eld that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God,
        and observe to do all the words of this law;
031:013 and that their children, who have not known, may hear,
        and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live
        in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
031:014 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die:
        call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting,
        that I may give him a charge.  Moses and Joshua went,
        and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
031:015 Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud:
        and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
031:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers;
        and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after
        the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them,
        and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
        made with them.
031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,
        and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them,
        and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles
        shall come on them; so that they will say in that day,
        Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?
031:018 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they
        shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
031:019 Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it
        the children of Israel:  put it in their mouths, that this
        song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I
        swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey,
        and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat;
        then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me,
        and break my covenant.
031:021 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,
        that this song shall testify before them as a witness;
        for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:
        for I know their imagination which they frame this day,
        before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
031:022 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.
031:023 He gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said,
        Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring
        the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them:
        and I will be with you.
031:024 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
        of this law in a book, until they were finished,
031:025 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh, saying,
031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there
        for a witness against you.
031:027 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck:  behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious
        against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?
031:028 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
        that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven
        and earth to witness against them.
031:029 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves,
        and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;
        and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you
        will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
        him to anger through the work of your hands.
031:030 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words
        of this song, until they were finished.
032:001 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear
        the words of my mouth.
032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain.  My speech shall
        condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass,
        as the showers on the herb.
032:003 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh.  Ascribe greatness
        to our God!
032:004 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice:
        a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.
032:005 They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not
        his children, [it is] their blemish.  [They are] a perverse
        and crooked generation.
032:006 Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise?
        Isn't he your father who has bought you?  He has made you,
        and established you.
032:007 Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.
        Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they
        will tell you.
032:008 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of
        the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
032:009 For Yahweh's portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot
        of his inheritance.
032:010 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness.
        He surrounded him.  He cared for him.  He kept him as the apple
        of his eye.
032:011 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young,
        he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them
        on his feathers.
032:012 Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.
032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
        He ate the increase of the field.  He caused him to suck
        honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
032:014 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of
        the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat.
        Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
032:015 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.
        You have grown thick.  You have become sleek.
        Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock
        of his salvation.
032:016 They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked
        him to anger with abominations.
032:017 They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods
        that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late,
        which your fathers didn't dread.
032:018 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,
        and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
032:019 Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation
        of his sons and his daughters.
032:020 He said, I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their
        end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation,
        children in whom is no faithfulness.
032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.
        They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.
        I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
        I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
032:022 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest
        Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets
        the foundations of the mountains on fire.
032:023 I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.
032:024 [They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat and bitter destruction.  I will send the teeth of animals
        on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
032:025 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both
        young man and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired man.
032:026 I said, I would scatter them afar.  I would make the memory
        of them to cease from among men;
032:027 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
        lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say,
        Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.
032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no
        understanding in them.
032:029 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!
032:030 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
        to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had
        delivered them up?
032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies
        themselves being judges.
032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.
        Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.
032:033 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.
032:034 Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
032:035 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their
        foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand.
        The things that are to come on them shall make haste.
032:036 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone,
        There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.
032:037 He will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which
        they took refuge;
032:038 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine
        of their drink offering?  Let them rise up and help you!
        Let them be your protection.
032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me.
        I kill, and I make alive.  I wound, and I heal.
        There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,
032:041 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment;
        I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense
        those who hate me.
032:042 I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall
        devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,
        from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
032:043 Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge
        the blood of his servants.  He will render vengeance
        to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land,
        for his people.
032:044 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears
        of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
032:045 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
032:046 He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I
        testify to you this day, which you shall command your children
        to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.
032:047 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,
        and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land,
        where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
032:048 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
032:049 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,
        which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho;
        and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children
        of Israel for a possession;
032:050 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered
        to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor,
        and was gathered to his people:
032:051 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children
        of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness
        of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of
        the children of Israel.
032:052 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go
        there into the land which I give the children of Israel.
033:001 This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed
        the children of Israel before his death.
033:002 He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.
        He shone forth from Mount Paran.  He came from the ten thousands
        of holy ones.  At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
033:003 Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.
        They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive
        of your words.
033:004 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
033:005 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered,
        All the tribes of Israel together.
033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.
033:007 This is [the blessing] of Judah:  and he said, Hear, Yahweh,
        the voice of Judah.  Bring him in to his people.
        With his hands he contended for himself.  You shall be a help
        against his adversaries.
033:008 Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your
        godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove
        at the waters of Meribah;
033:009 who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
        Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know
        his own children:  For they have observed your word,
        and keep your covenant.
033:010 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law.
        They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering
        on your altar.
033:011 Yahweh, bless his substance.  Accept the work of his hands.
        Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,
        of those who hate him, that they not rise again.
033:012 Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell
        in safety by him.  He covers him all the day long.
        He dwells between his shoulders.
033:013 Of Joseph he said, His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the
        precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep
        that couches beneath,
033:014 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious
        things of the growth of the moons,
033:015 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious
        things of the everlasting hills,
033:016 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
        the good will of him who lived in the bush{i. e.
        the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.}. Let [the blessing] come
        on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was
        separate from his brothers.
033:017 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.  His horns are
        the horns of the wild ox.  With them he shall push the peoples
        all of them, [even] the ends of the earth:  They are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim.  They are the thousands of Manasseh.
033:018 Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
        and Issachar, in your tents.
033:019 They shall call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will
        offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out
        the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.
033:020 Of Gad he said, He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
        He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown
        of the head.
033:021 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's
        portion reserved.  He came [with] the heads of the people.
        He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.
033:022 Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.
033:023 Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of
        the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.
033:024 Of Asher he said, Asher is blessed with children.
        Let him be acceptable to his brothers.  Let him dip his
        foot in oil.
033:025 Your bars shall be iron and brass.  As your days, so shall
        your strength be.
033:026 There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens
        for your help, In his excellency on the skies.
033:027 The eternal God is [your] dwelling place.  Underneath are
        the everlasting arms.  He thrust out the enemy from before you,
        and said, Destroy.
033:028 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land
        of grain and new wine.  Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
033:029 You are happy, Israel.  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,
        the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency!
        Your enemies shall submit themselves to you.  You shall tread
        on their high places.
034:001 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,
        to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.
        Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
034:002 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,
        and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
034:003 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city
        of palm trees, to Zoar.
034:004 Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed:
        I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall
        not go over there.
034:005 So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab,
        according to the word of Yahweh.
034:006 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against
        Beth Peor:  but no man knows of his tomb to this day.
034:007 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
034:008 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
        thirty days:  so the days of weeping in the mourning for
        Moses were ended.
034:009 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands on him:  and the children of Israel
        listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
034:010 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,
        whom Yahweh knew face to face,
034:011 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do
        in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,
034:012 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror,
        which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.
Book 06 Joshua
001:001 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,
        that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
        you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them,
        even to the children of Israel.
001:003 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will
        tread on, as I told Moses.
001:004 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river,
        the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
        and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
        shall be your border.
001:005 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
        As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  I will not fail
        you nor forsake you.
001:006 Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this
        people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers
        to give them.
001:007 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according
        to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you.
        Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left,
        that you may have good success wherever you go.
001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth,
        but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may
        observe to do according to all that is written therein:
        for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you
        shall have good success.
001:009 Haven't I commanded you?  Be strong and of good courage.
        Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:  for Yahweh your God
        is with you wherever you go.
001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
001:011 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people,
        saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass
        over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh
        your God gives you to possess it.'"
001:012 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to
        the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
001:013 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh
        commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God gives you rest,
        and will give you this land.
001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live
        in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you
        shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty
        men of valor, and shall help them
001:015 until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you,
        and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God
        gives them.  Then you shall return to the land of your possession,
        and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you
        beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"
001:016 They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us
        we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
001:017 Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you.
        Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
001:018 Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your
        words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death.
        Only be strong and of good courage."
002:001 Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim
        as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, and Jericho."
        They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name
        was Rahab, and slept there.
002:002 The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children
        of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."
002:003 The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men
        who have come to you, who have entered into your house;
        for they have come to spy out all the land."
002:004 The woman took the two men and hid them.  Then she said, "Yes,
        the men came to me, but I didn't know where they came from.
002:005 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it
        was dark, that the men went out.  Where the men went, I don't know.
        Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."
002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with
        the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.
002:007 The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords:
        and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out,
        they shut the gate.
002:008 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
002:009 and she said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given
        you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us,
        and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
002:010 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the
        Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} before you, when you came out of Egypt;
        and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
002:011 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did
        there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you:
        for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above,
        and on earth beneath.
002:012 Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt
        kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my
        father's house, and give me a true token;
002:013 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers,
        and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver
        our lives from death."
002:014 The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk
        about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."
002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window;
        for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived
        on the wall.
002:016 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you;
        and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers
        have returned.  Afterward, you may go your way."
002:017 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath
        which you have made us to swear.
002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by.
        You shall gather to yourself into the house your father,
        your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
002:019 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into
        the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless.
        Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head,
        if any hand is on him.
002:020 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall
        be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
002:021 She said, "According to your words, so be it."  She sent them away,
        and they departed.  She tied the scarlet line in the window.
002:022 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days,
        until the pursuers had returned.  The pursuers sought them
        throughout all the way, but didn't find them.
002:023 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain,
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told
        him all that had happened to them.
002:024 They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands
        all the land.  Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt
        away before us."
003:001 Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim,
        and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel.
        They lodged there before they passed over.
003:002 It happened after three days, that the officers went through
        the midst of the camp;
003:003 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests
        the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,
        and follow it.
003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure.  Don't come near to it, that you
        may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed
        this way before."
003:005 Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow
        Yahweh will do wonders among you."
003:006 Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark
        of the covenant, and pass over before the people."
        They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
003:007 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you
        in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I
        was with Moses, so I will be with you.
003:008 You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant,
        saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan,
        you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
003:009 Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear
        the words of Yahweh your God."
003:010 Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite,
        and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out
        from before you.
003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
        passes over before you into the Jordan.
003:012 Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        for every tribe a man.
003:013 It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests
        who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth,
        rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan
        will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;
        and they shall stand in one heap."
003:014 It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass
        over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        being before the people,
003:015 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,
        and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped
        in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its
        banks all the time of harvest),
003:016 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose
        up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is
        beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea
        of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off.
        Then the people passed over right against Jericho.
003:017 The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
        stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan;
        and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation
        had passed completely over the Jordan.
004:001 It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over
        the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:002 "Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
004:003 and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of
        the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm,
        twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them
        down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"
004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared
        of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
004:005 Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your
        God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up
        a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number
        of the tribes of the children of Israel;
004:006 that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'
004:007 then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan
        were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
        When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were
        cut off.  These stones shall be for a memorial to the children
        of Israel forever.'"
004:008 The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve
        stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua,
        according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
        and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged,
        and laid them down there.
004:009 Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,
        in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark
        of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
004:010 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan,
        until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak
        to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua;
        and the people hurried and passed over.
004:011 It happened, when all the people had completely passed over,
        that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the priests,
        in the presence of the people.
004:012 The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,
        as Moses spoke to them.
004:013 About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed
        over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
004:014 On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
        and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days
        of his life.
004:015 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:016 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony,
        that they come up out of the Jordan."
004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out
        of the Jordan!"
004:018 It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground,
        that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place,
        and went over all its banks, as before.
004:019 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day
        of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east
        border of Jericho.
004:020 Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of
        the Jordan, n Gilgal.
004:021 He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your
        children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do
        these stones mean?'
004:022 Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came
        over this Jordan on dry land.
004:023 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from
        before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh your God
        did to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, which he dried up
        from before us, until we had passed over;
004:024 that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh,
        that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.'"
005:001 It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites,
        who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up
        the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,
        until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was
        there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
005:002 At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make flint knives,
        and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."
005:003 Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
005:004 This is the reason Joshua circumcised:  all the people who came
        out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war,
        died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
005:005 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all
        the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
        until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt,
        were consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh.
        Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land
        which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
005:007 Their children, whom he raised up in their place,
        were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,
        because they had not circumcised them on the way.
005:008 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation,
        that they stayed in their places in the camp until
        they were healed.
005:009 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach
        of Egypt from off you."  Therefore the name of that place
        was called Gilgal,{"Gilgal" sounds like the Hebrew for "roll."
        } to this day.
005:010 The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.  They kept
        the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening
        in the plains of Jericho.
005:011 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce
        of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.
005:012 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce
        of the land.  The children of Israel didn't have manna any more;
        but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
005:013 It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
        his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him
        with his sword drawn in his hand.  Joshua went to him,
        and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
005:014 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army."
        Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped,
        and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
005:015 The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes
        off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy."
        Joshua did so.
006:001 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel.
        No one went out, and no one came in.
006:002 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand,
        with its king and the mighty men of valor.
006:003 All your men of war shall march around the city, going around
        the city once.  You shall do this six days.
006:004 Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark.  On the seventh day, you shall march around the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
006:005 It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn,
        and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people
        shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city
        shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man
        straight before him."
006:006 Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them,
        "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear
        seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."
006:007 They said to the people, "Advance!  March around the city,
        and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."
006:008 It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people,
        the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets;
        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.
006:009 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets,
        and the ark went after them.  The trumpets sounded as they went.
006:010 Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout,
        nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed
        out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout.
        Then you shall shout."
006:011 So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city,
        going about it once.  Then they came into the camp, and lodged
        in the camp.
006:012 Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of Yahweh.
006:013 The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually,
        and blew the trumpets:  and the armed men went before them.
        The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh.  The trumpets
        sounded as they went.
006:014 The second day they marched around the city once, and returned
        into the camp.  They did this six days.
006:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning
        of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times.
        Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.
006:016 It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,
        Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh has given
        you the city!
006:017 The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.
        Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with
        her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
006:018 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing,
        lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing;
        so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are holy to Yahweh.  They shall come into Yahweh's treasury."
006:020 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
        It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
        that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall
        fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.
006:021 They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey,
        with the edge of the sword.
006:022 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land,
        "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there
        the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."
006:023 The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab
        with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had.
        They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them
        outside of the camp of Israel.
006:024 They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.
        Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass
        and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.
006:025 But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all
        that she had, Joshua saved alive.  She lived in the midst
        of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers,
        whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
006:026 Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be
        the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho.
        With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation,
        and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
006:027 So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing;
        for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son
        of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing:
        and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the children of Israel.
007:002 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven,
        on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up
        and spy out the land.  The men went up and spied out Ai.
007:003 They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there;
        for they are but few.
007:004 So there went up there of the people about three thousand men:
        and they fled before the men of Ai.
007:005 The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they
        chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck
        them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted,
        and became as water.
007:006 Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before
        the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel;
        and they put dust on their heads.
007:007 Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought
        this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been
        content and lived beyond the Jordan!
007:008 Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned
        their backs before their enemies!
007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will
        hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth:  and what will you do for your great name?
007:010 Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen
        on your face?
007:011 Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them:  yes, they have even taken
        of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also;
        and they have even put it among their own stuff.
007:012 Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies;
        they turn their backs before their enemies, because they
        are become accursed:  I will not be with you any more,
        except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.
007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves
        against tomorrow:  for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, There is
        a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not stand
        before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing
        from among you.
007:014 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes:
        and it shall be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come
        near by families; and the family which Yahweh shall take
        shall come near by households; and the household which Yahweh
        shall take shall come near man by man.
007:015 It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall
        be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has
        transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done
        folly in Israel.
007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
        near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
007:017 and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family
        of the Zerahites:  and he brought near the family of the Zerahites
        man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
007:018 and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan,
        the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah,
        of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
007:019 Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me
        now what you have done; don't hide it from me.
007:020 Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned
        against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
007:021 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle,
        and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
        of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them;
        and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,
        and the silver under it.
007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,
        it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
007:023 They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them
        to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel; and they laid
        them down before Yahweh.
007:024 Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
        and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had:
        and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
007:025 Joshua said, Why have you troubled us?  Yahweh shall
        trouble you this day.  All Israel stoned him with stones;
        and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
007:026 They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day;
        and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger.
        Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor"
        to this day.
008:001 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:
        take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up
        to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai,
        and his people, and his city, and his land;
008:002 You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king:
        only the spoil of it, and the livestock of it, shall you
        take for a prey to yourselves:  set you an ambush for the
        city behind it.
008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai:
        and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor,
        and sent them forth by night.
008:004 He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against
        the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city,
        but be all ready:
008:005 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.
        It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first,
        that we will flee before them;
008:006 and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them
        away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us,
        as at the first:  so we will flee before them;
008:007 and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of
        the city:  for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.
008:008 It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set
        the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh shall you do:
        behold, I have commanded you.
008:009 Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush,
        and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai:
        but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
008:010 Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,
        and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
008:011 All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him,
        went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped
        on the north side of Ai:  now there was a valley between
        him and Ai.
008:012 He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between
        Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
008:013 So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north
        of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city;
        and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
008:014 It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried
        and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against
        Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed,
        before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush
        against him behind the city.
008:015 Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
        and fled by the way of the wilderness.
008:016 All the people who were in the city were called together
        to pursue after them:  and they pursued after Joshua,
        and were drawn away from the city.
008:017 There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El, who didn't
        go out after Israel:  and they left the city open,
        and pursued after Israel.
008:018 Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in
        your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.
        Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand
        toward the city.
008:019 The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
        as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city,
        and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.
008:020 When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold,
        the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no
        power to flee this way or that way:  and the people who fled
        to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
008:021 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
        and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
        and killed the men of Ai.
008:022 The others came forth out of the city against them;
        so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,
        and some on that side:  and they struck them, so that they
        let none of them remain or escape.
008:023 The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
008:024 It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the
        inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they
        pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword,
        until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword.
008:025 All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand,
        even all the men of Ai.
008:026 For Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched
        out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the
        inhabitants of Ai.
008:027 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took
        for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh
        which he commanded Joshua.
008:028 So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation,
        to this day.
008:029 The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening:
        and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they
        took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance
        of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap
        of stones, to this day.
008:030 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in Mount Ebal,
008:031 as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel,
        as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar
        of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron:
        and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.
008:032 He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
008:033 All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges,
        stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests
        the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        as well the foreigner as the native; half of them in front
        of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal;
        as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first,
        that they should bless the people of Israel.
008:034 Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing
        and the curse, according to all that is written in the book
        of the law.
008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        didn't read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women,
        and the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.
009:001 It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,
        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore
        of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        heard of it;
009:002 that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.
009:003 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        to Jericho and to Ai,
009:004 they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they
        had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys,
        and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,
009:005 and old and patched shoes on their feet, and old garments on them;
        and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become moldy.
009:006 They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him,
        and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country:
        now therefore make you a covenant with us.
009:007 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you dwell among us;
        and how shall we make a covenant with you?
009:008 They said to Joshua, We are your servants.  Joshua said to them,
        Who are you? and from whence come you?
009:009 They said to him, From a very far country your servants
        are come because of the name of Yahweh your God:
        for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
009:010 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
        who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon,
        and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
009:011 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke
        to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your servants:
        and now make you a covenant with us.
009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry,
        and is become moldy:
009:013 and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold,
        they are torn:  and these our garments and our shoes are become
        old by reason of the very long journey.
009:014 The men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at
        the mouth of Yahweh.
009:015 Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them,
        to let them live:  and the princes of the congregation
        swore to them.
009:016 It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant
        with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors,
        and that they lived among them.
009:017 The children of Israel traveled, and came to their cities on
        the third day.  Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah,
        and Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.
009:018 The children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel.
        All the congregation murmured against the princes.
009:019 But all the princes said to all the congregation,
        We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel:
        now therefore we may not touch them.
009:020 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,
        because of the oath which we swore to them.
009:021 The princes said to them, Let them live:  so they became
        wood cutters and drawers of water to all the congregation,
        as the princes had spoken to them.
009:022 Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,
        Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you;
        when you dwell among us?
009:023 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be
        of you bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the house of my God.
009:024 They answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told your servants, how that Yahweh your God commanded
        his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to
        destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you;
        therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you,
        and have done this thing.
009:025 Now, behold, we are in your hand:  as it seems good and right
        to you to do to us, do.
009:026 So did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they didn't kill them.
009:027 That day Joshua made those wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day,
        in the place which he should choose.
010:001 Now it happened, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua
        had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done
        to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king;
        and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel,
        and were among them;
010:002 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,
        as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men of it were mighty.
010:003 Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron,
        and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish,
        and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
010:004 Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it
        has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
        the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,
        the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,
        they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon,
        and made war against it.
010:006 The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Don't slack your hand from your servants;
        come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us:
        for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill
        country are gathered together against us.
010:007 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
010:008 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them:  for I have delivered
        them into your hands; there shall not a man of them
        stand before you.
010:009 Joshua therefore came on them suddenly; [for] he went up
        from Gilgal all the night.
010:010 Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way
        of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah,
        and to Makkedah.
010:011 It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they
        were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down
        great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died:
        they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom
        the children of Israel killed with the sword.
010:012 Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel;
        and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still
        on Gibeon; You, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
010:013 The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation
        had avenged themselves of their enemies.  Isn't this written
        in the book of Jashar?  The sun stayed in the midst of the sky,
        and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.
010:014 There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh
        listened to the voice of a man:  for Yahweh fought for Israel.
010:015 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
010:016 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
010:017 It was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found,
        hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
010:018 Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it to keep them:
010:019 but don't stay; pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost
        of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities:
        for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.
010:020 It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
        made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter,
        until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained
        of them had entered into the fortified cities,
010:021 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at
        Makkedah in peace:  none moved his tongue against any of
        the children of Israel.
010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth
        those five kings to me out of the cave.
010:023 They did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out
        of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
010:024 It happened, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua,
        that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him,
        Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.
        They came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.
010:025 Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed;
        be strong and of good courage:  for thus shall Yahweh do
        to all your enemies against whom you fight.
010:026 Afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged
        them on five trees:  and they were hanging on the trees
        until the evening.
010:027 It happened at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,
        and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
010:028 Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king of it:  he utterly destroyed them
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining;
        and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the
        king of Jericho.
010:029 Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah,
        and fought against Libnah:
010:030 and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand
        of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining in it;
        and he did to the king of it as he had done to the king of Jericho.
010:031 Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish,
        and encamped against it, and fought against it:
010:032 and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel;
        and he took it on the second day, and struck it with
        the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were therein,
        according to all that he had done to Libnah.
010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
010:034 Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon;
        and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
010:035 and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword; and all the souls who were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
010:036 Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron;
        and they fought against it:
010:037 and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls
        who were therein; he left none remaining, according to all
        that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it,
        and all the souls who were therein.
010:038 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir,
        and fought against it:
010:039 and he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it;
        and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
        destroyed all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining:
        as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king of it;
        as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king of it.
010:040 So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South,
        and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings:
        he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed,
        as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.
010:041 Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all
        the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
010:042 All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
        because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
010:043 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
011:001 It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent
        to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron,
        and to the king of Achshaph,
011:002 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country,
        and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland,
        and in the heights of Dor on the west,
011:003 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite,
        and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the
        hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
011:004 They went out, they and all their armies with them, much people,
        even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude,
        with horses and chariots very many.
011:005 All these kings met together; and they came and encamped
        together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
011:006 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them;
        for tomorrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel:  you shall hamstring their horses, and burn
        their chariots with fire.
011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
        by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.
011:008 Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
        and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim,
        and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they struck them,
        until they left them none remaining.
011:009 Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him:  he hamstrung their horses,
        and burnt their chariots with fire.
011:010 Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck
        the king of it with the sword:  for Hazor before was the head
        of all those kingdoms.
011:011 They struck all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword,
        utterly destroying them; there was none left who breathed:
        and he burnt Hazor with fire.
011:012 All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and he struck them with the edge of
        the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded.
011:013 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned
        none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
011:014 All the spoil of these cities, and the livestock, the children
        of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they
        struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,
        neither left they any who breathed.
011:015 As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua:
        and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South,
        and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah,
        and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
011:017 from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad
        in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon:  and all their
        kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death.
011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children
        of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
        they took all in battle.
011:020 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against
        Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them,
        that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:021 Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the
        hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from
        all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country
        of Israel:  Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
011:022 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children
        of Israel:  only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,
        did some remain.
011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh
        spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance
        to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
        The land had rest from war.
012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
        Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward
        the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,
        and all the Arabah eastward:
012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead,
        even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
012:003 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to
        the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way
        to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
012:004 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,
        who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
012:005 and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
012:006 Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:
        and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to
        the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
012:007 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children
        of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in
        the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir;
        and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession
        according to their divisions;
012:008 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,
        and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South;
        the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
012:009 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
012:010 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
012:011 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
012:012 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
012:013 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
012:014 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
012:015 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
012:016 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
012:017 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
012:018 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
012:019 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
012:020 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
012:021 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
012:022 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
012:023 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim
        in Gilgal, one;
012:024 the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.
013:001 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said
        to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there
        remains yet very much land to be possessed.
013:002 This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of
        the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
013:003 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border
        of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites;
        the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites,
        the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites;
        also the Avvim,
013:004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border
        of the Amorites;
013:005 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,
        from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;
013:006 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to
        Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive
        out from before the children of Israel:  only allot you it
        to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
013:008 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,
        which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses
        the servant of Yahweh gave them:
013:009 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all
        the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
013:010 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned
        in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
013:011 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
        and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
013:012 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim);
        for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.
013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,
        nor the Maacathites:  but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst
        of Israel to this day.
013:014 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance,
        as he spoke to him.
013:015 Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according
        to their families.
013:016 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
        of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
        and all the plain by Medeba;
013:017 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,
        and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,
013:018 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
013:019 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount
        of the valley,
013:020 and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,
013:021 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck
        with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur,
        and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel kill with the sword among the rest of their slain.
013:023 The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border
        [of it]. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben
        according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:024 Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,
        according to their families.
013:025 Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,
        and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that
        is before Rabbah;
013:026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
        to the border of Debir;
013:027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,
        and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part
        of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according
        to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:029 Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:
        and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families.
013:030 Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are
        in Bashan, sixty cities:
013:031 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir
        the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
        of Machir according to their families.
013:032 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains
        of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
013:033 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
014:001 These are the inheritances which the children of Israel
        took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
        and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        distributed to them,
014:002 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,
        for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and
        the half-tribe beyond the Jordan:  but to the Levites he gave
        no inheritance among them.
014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
        and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land,
        save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs of it for their
        livestock and for their substance.
014:005 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;
        and they divided the land.
014:006 Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:
        and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
        You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God
        concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.
014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent
        me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in my heart.
014:008 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.
014:009 Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and
        to your children forever, because you have wholly followed
        Yahweh my God.
014:010 Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,
        these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke
        this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness:
        and now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:
        as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
        and to go out and to come in.
014:012 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,
        and cities great and fortified:  it may be that Yahweh will
        be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
014:013 Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
014:014 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly
        followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
014:015 Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;
        [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim.
        The land had rest from war.
015:001 The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
        families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness
        of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
015:002 Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,
        from the bay that looks southward;
015:003 and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed
        along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea,
        and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned
        about to Karka;
015:004 and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook
        of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea:
        this shall be your south border.
015:005 The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.
        The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea
        at the end of the Jordan;
015:006 and the border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by
        the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone
        of Bohan the son of Reuben;
015:007 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against
        the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river;
        and the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh,
        and the goings out of it were at En Rogel;
015:008 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom
        to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem);
        and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies
        before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost
        part of the valley of Rephaim northward;
015:009 and the border extended from the top of the mountain
        to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to
        the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim);
015:010 and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,
        and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north
        (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh,
        and passed along by Timnah;
015:011 and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;
        and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along
        to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings
        out of the border were at the sea.
015:012 The west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it].
        This is the border of the children of Judah round about
        according to their families.
015:013 To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children
        of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua,
        even Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron).
015:014 Caleb drove out there the three sons of Anak:  Sheshai, and Ahiman,
        and Talmai, the children of Anak.
015:015 He went up there against the inhabitants of Debir:
        now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
015:016 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
015:017 Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
015:018 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said, What would you?
015:019 She said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.
015:021 The uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel,
        and Eder, and Jagur,
015:022 and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
015:023 and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
015:025 Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth, Hezron (the same is Hazor),
015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
015:027 and Hazar Gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth Pelet,
015:028 and Hazar Shual, and Beersheba, and Biziothiah,
015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
015:030 and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
015:031 and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
015:032 and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon:  all the cities
        are twenty-nine, with their villages.
015:033 In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
015:034 and Zanoah, and En Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
015:036 and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages.
015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal Gad,
015:038 and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
015:040 and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,
015:041 and Gederoth, Beth Dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah;
        sixteen cities with their villages.
015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
015:043 and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
015:044 and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities
        with their villages.
015:045 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
015:046 from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod,
        with their villages.
015:047 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and
        its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border [of it].
015:048 In the hill country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
015:049 and Dannah, and Kiriath Sannah (the same is Debir),
015:050 and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
015:051 and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
015:053 and Janim, and Beth Tappuah, and Aphekah,
015:054 and Humtah, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior;
        nine cities with their villages.
015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,
015:056 and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
015:057 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
015:058 Halhul, Beth Zur, and Gedor,
015:059 and Maarath, and Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities
        with their villages.
015:060 Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah;
        two cities with their villages.
015:061 In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
015:062 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities
        with their villages.
015:063 As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
        of Judah couldn't drive them out:  but the Jebusites dwell
        with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
016:001 The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan
        at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,
        even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill
        country to Bethel;
016:002 and it went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border
        of the Archites to Ataroth;
016:003 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites,
        to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to Gezer;
        and the goings out of it were at the sea.
016:004 The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
016:005 The border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was [thus]: the border of their inheritance eastward
        was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper;
016:006 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north;
        and the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh,
        and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
016:007 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah,
        and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
016:008 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook
        of Kanah; and the goings out of it were at the sea.
        This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
        according to their families;
016:009 together with the cities which were set apart for the children
        of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children
        of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
016:010 They didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer:
        but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day,
        and are become servants to do forced labor.
017:001 [This] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was
        the firstborn of Joseph.  As for Machir the firstborn
        of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
017:002 So [the lot] was for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families:  for the children of Abiezer,
        and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,
        and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher,
        and for the children of Shemida:  these were the male children
        of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,
        the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons,
        but daughters:  and these are the names of his daughters:
        Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
017:004 They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
        the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh commanded
        Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:
        therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them
        an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
017:005 There fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead
        and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
017:006 because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons.
        The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
017:007 The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is
        before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand,
        to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.
017:008 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on
        the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
017:009 The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook:
        these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh:
        and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook,
        and the goings out of it were at the sea:
017:010 southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north,
        and to Issachar on the east.
017:011 Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth Shean and its towns,
        and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns,
        and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't drive out [the inhabitants
        of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
017:013 It happened, when the children of Israel had grown strong,
        that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn't
        utterly drive them out.
017:014 The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you
        given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I
        am a great people, because hitherto Yahweh has blessed me?
017:015 Joshua said to them, If you are a great people, go up to the forest,
        and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites
        and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too
        narrow for you.
017:016 The children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us:
        and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have
        chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth Shean and its towns,
        and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
017:017 Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power;
        you shall not have one lot only:
017:018 but the hill country shall be yours; for though it is a forest,
        you shall cut it down, and the goings out of it shall be yours;
        for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have
        chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
018:001 The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there:
        and the land was subdued before them.
018:002 There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet divided their inheritance.
018:003 Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go
        in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you?
018:004 Appoint for you three men of each tribe:  and I will send them,
        and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe
        it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.
018:005 They shall divide it into seven portions:  Judah shall abide
        in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their border on the north.
018:006 You shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring
        [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you
        here before Yahweh our God.
018:007 For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood
        of Yahweh is their inheritance:  and Gad and Reuben and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
        beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of
        Yahweh gave them.
018:008 The men arose, and went:  and Joshua charged those who went
        to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,
        and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots
        for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.
018:009 The men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came
        to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
018:010 Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh:
        and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.
018:011 The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families:  and the border of their lot went
        out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
018:012 Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan;
        and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north,
        and went up through the hill country westward; and the goings
        out of it were at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
018:013 The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz
        (the same is Bethel), southward; and the border went down
        to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south
        of Beth Horon the lower.
018:014 The border extended [there], and turned about on the west
        quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before
        Beth Horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath Baal
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah:
        this was the west quarter.
018:015 The south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath Jearim;
        and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring
        of the waters of Nephtoah;
018:016 and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain
        that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is
        in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to
        the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward,
        and went down to En Rogel;
018:017 and it extended northward, and went out at En Shemesh, and went
        out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim;
        and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
018:018 and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward,
        and went down to the Arabah;
018:019 and the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward;
        and the goings out of the border were at the north
        bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan:
        this was the south border.
018:020 The Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter.
        This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin,
        by the borders of it round about, according to their families.
018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Beth Hoglah,
        and Emek Keziz,
018:022 and Beth Arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
018:023 and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
018:024 and Chephar Ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities
        with their villages:
018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
018:026 and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
018:027 and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
018:028 and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath,
        [and] Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
        This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according
        to their families.
019:001 The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe
        of the children of Simeon according to their families:
        and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance
        of the children of Judah.
019:002 They had for their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
019:003 and Hazar Shual, and Balah, and Ezem,
019:004 and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
019:005 and Ziklag, and Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar Susah,
019:006 and Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:
019:007 Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:
019:008 and all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South.  This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
019:009 Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance
        of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children
        of Judah was too much for them:  therefore the children
        of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
019:010 The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
        to their families; and the border of their inheritance
        was to Sarid;
019:011 and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached
        to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
019:012 and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to
        the border of Chisloth Tabor; and it went out to Daberath,
        and went up to Japhia;
019:013 and from there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin;
        and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah;
019:014 and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon;
        and the goings out of it were at the valley of Iphtah El;
019:015 and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
        twelve cities with their villages.
019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:017 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children
        of Issachar according to their families.
019:018 Their border was to Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
019:019 and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,
019:020 and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,
019:021 and Remeth, and Engannim, and En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez,
019:022 and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh;
        and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.
019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:024 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families.
019:025 Their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
019:026 and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to
        Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;
019:027 and it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached
        to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek
        and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
019:028 and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon;
019:029 and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre;
        and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out of it
        were at the sea by the region of Achzib;
019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:  twenty-two cities
        with their villages.
019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:032 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.
019:033 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim,
        and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the goings out
        of it were at the Jordan;
019:034 and the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out
        from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south,
        and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan
        toward the sunrise.
019:035 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
        and Chinnereth,
019:036 and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
019:037 and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En Hazor,
019:038 Iron, and Migdal El, Horem, and Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.
019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:040 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families.
019:041 The border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,
019:042 and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah,
019:043 and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron,
019:044 and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
019:045 and Jehud, and Bene Berak, and Gath Rimmon,
019:046 and Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
019:047 The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them;
        for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem,
        and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.
019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:049 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance
        by the borders of it; and the children of Israel gave an
        inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
019:050 according to the commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city
        which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim;
        and he built the city, and lived therein.
019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
        the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes
        of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot
        in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.
        So they made an end of dividing the land.
020:001 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities
        of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,
020:003 that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly [and]
        unawares may flee there:  and they shall be to you for a refuge
        from the avenger of blood.
020:004 He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at
        the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause
        in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall
        take him into the city to them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.
020:005 If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck
        his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him before.
020:006 He shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest
        that shall be in those days:  then shall the manslayer return,
        and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city
        from whence he fled.
020:007 They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali,
        and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba
        (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
020:008 Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer
        in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
        and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
        in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
020:009 These were the appointed cities for all the children
        of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them,
        that whoever kills any person unwittingly might flee there,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood
        before the congregation.
021:001 Then came near the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites
        to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,
        and to the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of
        the children of Israel;
021:002 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in,
        with the suburbs of it for our livestock.
021:003 The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities
        with their suburbs.
021:004 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:
        and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
021:005 The rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
021:006 The children of Gershon had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher,
        and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe
        of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
021:007 The children of Merari according to their families had
        out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,
        and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
021:008 The children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities
        with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.
021:009 They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah,
        and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities
        which are [here] mentioned by name:
021:010 and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families
        of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi;
        for theirs was the first lot.
021:011 They gave them Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron), in the hill country of Judah,
        with the suburbs of it round about it.
021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages of it, gave they
        to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
021:013 To the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Libnah with its suburbs,
021:014 and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
021:015 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
021:016 and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs,
        [and] Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of
        those two tribes.
021:017 Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs,
        Geba with its suburbs,
021:018 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests,
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:020 The families of the children of Kohath, the Levites,
        even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
021:021 They gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country
        of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer
        with its suburbs,
021:022 and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth Horon with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:023 Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs,
        Gibbethon with its suburbs,
021:024 Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:025 Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs,
        and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
021:026 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children
        of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
021:027 To the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
        out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
021:028 Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs,
        Daberath with its suburbs,
021:029 Jarmuth with its suburbs, En Gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
021:030 Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs,
        Abdon with its suburbs,
021:031 Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
021:032 Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammothdor with
        its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:034 To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites,
        out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs,
        and Kartah with its suburbs,
021:035 Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
021:036 Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz
        with its suburbs,
021:037 Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:038 Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
021:039 Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs;
        four cities in all.
021:040 All [these were] the cities of the children of Merari according
        to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites;
        and their lot was twelve cities.
021:041 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession
        of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities
        with their suburbs.
021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
        thus it was with all these cities.
021:043 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give
        to their fathers; and they possessed it, and lived therein.
021:044 Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore
        to their fathers:  and there stood not a man of all their
        enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies
        into their hand.
021:045 There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had
        spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
022:002 and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all
        that I commanded you:
022:003 you have not left your brothers these many days to this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your God.
022:004 Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke
        to them:  therefore now turn you, and get you to your tents,
        to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant
        of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.
022:005 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses
        the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
        and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went
        to their tents.
022:007 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        [inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half gave
        Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward;
        moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents,
        he blessed them,
022:008 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents,
        and with very much livestock, with silver, and with gold,
        and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing:
        divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.
022:009 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel
        out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land
        of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
022:010 When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land
        of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan,
        a great altar to look on.
022:011 The children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan,
        in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains
        to the children of Israel.
022:012 When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
        of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh,
        to go up against them to war.
022:013 The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
022:014 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for
        each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them
        head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.
022:015 They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad,
        and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead,
        and they spoke with them, saying,
022:016 Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass
        is this that you have committed against the God of Israel,
        to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you
        have built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?
022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we
        have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came
        a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,
022:018 that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? and it
        will be, seeing you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow
        he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
022:019 However, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh,
        in which Yahweh's tent dwells, and take possession among us:
        but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us,
        in building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.
022:020 Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing,
        and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
        didn't perish alone in his iniquity.
022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads
        of the thousands of Israel,
022:022 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows;
        and Israel he shall know:  if it be in rebellion, or if in
        trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),
022:023 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh;
        or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal offering,
        or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings thereon,
        let Yahweh himself require it;
022:024 and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this,
        [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might
        speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Yahweh,
        the God of Israel?
022:025 for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you,
        you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion
        in Yahweh:  so might your children make our children cease
        from fearing Yahweh.
022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
022:027 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our
        generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not tell
        our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.
022:028 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us
        or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say,
        Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;
        but it is a witness between us and you.
022:029 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh,
        and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar
        for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice,
        besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tent.
022:030 When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation,
        even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him,
        heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children
        of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.
022:031 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children
        of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,
        because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh:
        now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the
        hand of Yahweh.
022:032 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children
        of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan,
        to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
022:033 The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
        Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them
        to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad lived.
022:034 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
        the altar [Ed]: For, [said they], it is a witness between us
        that Yahweh is God.
023:001 It happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest
        to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua
        was old and well stricken in years;
023:002 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for
        their heads, and for their judges and for their officers,
        and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years:
023:003 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all
        these nations because of you; for Yahweh your God, he it
        is that has fought for you.
023:004 Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain,
        to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great
        sea toward the going down of the sun.
023:005 Yahweh your God, he will thrust them out from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess
        their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
023:006 Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn
        aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
023:007 that you not come among these nations, these that remain
        among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods,
        nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow
        down yourselves to them;
023:008 but cleave to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day.
023:009 For Yahweh has driven out from before you great nations and strong:
        but as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Yahweh your God,
        he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to you.
023:011 Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love
        Yahweh your God.
023:012 Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant
        of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make
        marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
023:013 know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive
        these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be
        a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides,
        and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this
        good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:014 Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
        and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
        that not one thing has failed of all the good things which
        Yahweh your God spoke concerning you; all are happen to you,
        not one thing has failed of it.
023:015 It shall happen, that as all the good things are come on you
        of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so will Yahweh bring
        on you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from
        off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:016 When you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods,
        and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Yahweh
        be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he has given to you.
024:001 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
        and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads,
        and for their judges, and for their officers; and they
        presented themselves before God.
024:002 Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River,
        even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor:
        and they served other gods.
024:003 I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him
        throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed,
        and gave him Isaac.
024:004 I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:  and I gave to Esau Mount Seir,
        to possess it:  and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
024:005 I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did in the midst of it:  and afterward I
        brought you out.
024:006 I brought your fathers out of Egypt:  and you came to the sea;
        and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots
        and with horsemen to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
024:007 When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between
        you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them,
        and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt:
        and you lived in the wilderness many days.
024:008 I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond
        the Jordan:  and they fought with you; and I gave them into
        your hand, and you possessed their land; and I destroyed them
        from before you.
024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought
        against Israel:  and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor
        to curse you;
024:010 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
        so I delivered you out of his hand.
024:011 You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho:  and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
024:012 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,
        even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword,
        nor with your bow.
024:013 I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities
        which you didn't build, and you dwell therein; of vineyards
        and olive groves which you didn't plant do you eat.
024:014 Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
        and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River,
        and in Egypt; and serve you Yahweh.
024:015 If it seem evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose you this day whom
        you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
        that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,
        in whose land you dwell:  but as for me and my house,
        we will serve Yahweh.
024:016 The people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh,
        to serve other gods;
024:017 for Yahweh our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers
        up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples
        through the midst of whom we passed;
024:018 and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites
        who lived in the land:  therefore we also will serve Yahweh;
        for he is our God.
024:019 Joshua said to the people, You can't serve Yahweh;
        for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your disobedience nor your sins.
024:020 If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will
        turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he has
        done you good.
024:021 The people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.
024:022 Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against
        yourselves that you have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him.
        They said, We are witnesses.
024:023 Now therefore put away, [said he], the foreign gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
024:024 The people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God will we serve,
        and to his voice will we listen.
024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
024:026 Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God;
        and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak
        that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.
024:027 Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
        a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh
        which he spoke to us:  it shall be therefore a witness against you,
        lest you deny your God.
024:028 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
024:029 It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
        the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
024:030 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,
        which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
024:031 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days
        of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work
        of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.
024:032 The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel
        of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor
        the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money:
        and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
024:033 Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill
        of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill
        country of Ephraim.
Book 07 Judges
001:001 It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel
        asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall go up for us first against
        the Canaanites, to fight against them?
001:002 Yahweh said, Judah shall go up:  behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand.
001:003 Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
        that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise
        will go with you into your lot.  So Simeon went with him.
001:004 Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the
        Perizzites into their hand:  and they struck of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men.
001:005 They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him,
        and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
001:006 But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,
        and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
001:007 Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their
        great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table:
        as I have done, so God has requited me."  They brought him
        to Jerusalem, and he died there.
001:008 The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
001:009 Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South,
        and in the lowland.
001:010 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they
        struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
001:011 From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir.
        (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)
001:012 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
001:013 Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
001:014 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said to her, What would you?
001:015 She said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
001:016 The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah
        into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad;
        and they went and lived with the people.
001:017 Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the
        Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        The name of the city was called Hormah.
001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon
        with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.
001:019 Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out [the inhabitants of]
        the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants
        of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
001:020 They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken:
        and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.
001:021 The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who
        inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children
        of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
001:022 The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel;
        and Yahweh was with them.
001:023 The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel.  (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.)
001:024 The watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city,
        and we will deal kindly with you.
001:025 He shown them the entrance into the city; and they struck
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go
        and all his family.
001:026 The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
        and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it
        to this day.
001:027 Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth Shean and
        its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and
        its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns;
        but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
001:028 It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put
        the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly
        drive them out.
001:029 Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer;
        but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
001:030 Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
        inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them,
        and became subject to forced labor.
001:031 Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants
        of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah,
        nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
001:032 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land; for they did not drive them out.
001:033 Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived
        among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
        nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath
        became subject to forced labor.
001:034 The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country;
        for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
001:035 but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon,
        and in Shaalbim:  yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,
        so that they became subject to forced labor.
001:036 The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim,
        from the rock, and upward.
002:001 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim.
        He said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought
        you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said,
        I will never break my covenant with you:
002:002 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land;
        you shall break down their altars.  But you have not listened
        to my voice:  why have you done this?
002:003 Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you;
        but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare to you.
002:004 It happened, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words
        to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up
        their voice, and wept.
002:005 They called the name of that place Bochim:  and they sacrificed
        there to Yahweh.
002:006 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel
        went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
002:007 The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen
        all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.
002:008 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one
        hundred ten years old.
002:009 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
002:010 Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, who didn't
        know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.
002:011 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
002:012 and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,
        of the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed
        themselves down to them:  and they provoked Yahweh to anger.
002:013 They forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
002:014 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered
        them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them;
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
002:015 Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them
        for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them:
        and they were sore distressed.
002:016 Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand
        of those who despoiled them.
002:017 Yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they played the
        prostitute after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them:
        they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their
        fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh;
        [but] they didn't do so.
002:018 When Yahweh raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge,
        and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
        of the judge:  for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning
        by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them.
002:019 But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back,
        and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following
        other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn't
        cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
002:020 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said,
        Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;
002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them
        of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
002:022 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their fathers did
        keep it, or not.
002:023 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily;
        neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
003:001 Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all
        the wars of Canaan;
003:002 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,
        to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:
003:003 [namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon,
        from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
003:004 They were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded
        their fathers by Moses.
003:005 The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites,
        and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites:
003:006 and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
003:007 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals
        and the Asheroth.
003:008 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia:
        and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.
003:009 When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
        up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them,
        even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
003:010 The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel;
        and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim
        king of Mesopotamia into his hand:  and his hand prevailed
        against Cushan Rishathaim.
003:011 The land had rest forty years.  Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
003:012 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab
        against Israel, because they had done that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh.
003:013 He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek;
        and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city
        of palm trees.
003:014 The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
003:015 But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
        them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
        a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him
        to Eglon the king of Moab.
003:016 Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length;
        and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.
003:017 He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab:  now Eglon was
        a very fat man.
003:018 When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away
        the people who bore the tribute.
003:019 But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal,
        and said, I have a secret errand to you, king.  He said,
        Keep silence.  All who stood by him went out from him.
003:020 Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool
        upper room.  Ehud said, I have a message from God to you.
        He arose out of his seat.
003:021 Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his body:
003:022 and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body;
        and it came out behind.
003:023 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors
        of the upper room on him, and locked them.
003:024 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw,
        and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said,
        Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
003:025 They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn't open
        the doors of the upper room:  therefore they took the key,
        and opened [them], and behold, their lord was fallen down dead
        on the earth.
003:026 Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries,
        and escaped to Seirah.
003:027 It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in
        the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the hill country, and he before them.
003:028 He said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your
        enemies the Moabites into your hand.  They went down after him,
        and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites,
        and didn't allow a man to pass over.
003:029 They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men,
        every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped
        not a man.
003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.
        The land had rest eighty years.
003:031 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck
        of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad:
        and he also saved Israel.
004:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.
004:002 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera,
        who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
004:003 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh:  for he had nine hundred
        chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed
        the children of Israel.
004:004 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time.
004:005 She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel
        in the hill country of Ephraim:  and the children of Israel
        came up to her for judgment.
004:006 She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, Hasn't Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, commanded, [saying], Go and draw to Mount Tabor,
        and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun?
004:007 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain
        of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into your hand.
004:008 Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go;
        but if you will not go with me, I will not go.
004:009 She said, I will surely go with you:  notwithstanding, the journey
        that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh
        will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.  Deborah arose,
        and went with Barak to Kedesh.
004:010 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh;
        and there went up ten thousand men at his feet:
        and Deborah went up with him.
004:011 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites,
        even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses,
        and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim,
        which is by Kedesh.
004:012 They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
        to Mount Tabor.
004:013 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
        chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him,
        from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
004:014 Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has
        delivered Sisera into your hand; hasn't Yahweh gone out before you?
        So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand
        men after him.
004:015 Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army,
        with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted
        from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army,
        to Harosheth of the Gentiles:  and all the army of Sisera
        fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
004:017 However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael
        the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin
        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
004:018 Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord,
        turn in to me; don't be afraid.  He came in to her into the tent,
        and she covered him with a rug.
004:019 He said to her, Please give me a little water to drink;
        for I am thirsty.  She opened a bottle of milk, and gave
        him drink, and covered him.
004:020 He said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be,
        when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there
        any man here? that you shall say, No.
004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer
        in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin
        into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground;
        for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
004:022 Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
        and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.
        He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent
        peg was in his temples.
004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before
        the children of Israel.
004:024 The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more
        against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed
        Jabin king of Canaan.
005:001 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
005:002 Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people
        offered themselves willingly, be blessed, Yahweh!
005:003 Hear, you kings!  Give ear, you princes!  I, [even] I,
        will sing to Yahweh.  I will sing praise to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel.
005:004 Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, when you marched out
        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
        Yes, the clouds dropped water.
005:005 The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, even Sinai,
        at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
        the highways were unoccupied.  The travelers walked through byways.
005:007 The rulers ceased in Israel.  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
        Until I arose a mother in Israel.
005:008 They chose new gods.  Then war was in the gates.  Was there
        a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered
        themselves willingly among the people.  Bless Yahweh!
005:010 Tell [of it], you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit
        on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.
005:011 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing
        water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts
        of Yahweh, [Even] the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
        Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah!  Awake, awake, utter a song!
        Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.
005:013 Then a remnant of the nobles [and] the people came down.
        Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.
005:014 Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you,
        Benjamin, among your peoples.  Governors come down out of Machir.
        Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zebulun.
005:015 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.  As was Issachar,
        so was Barak.  They rushed into the valley at his feet.
        By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.
005:016 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling
        for the flocks?  At the watercourses of Reuben There were
        great searchings of heart.
005:017 Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.  Why did Dan remain in ships?
        Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.
005:018 Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths;
        Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
005:019 The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at
        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.  They took no plunder of silver.
005:020 From the sky the stars fought.  From their courses,
        they fought against Sisera.
005:021 The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river,
        the river Kishon.  My soul, march on with strength.
005:022 Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings,
        the prancings of their strong ones.
005:023 Curse Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh.  Curse bitterly
        its inhabitants, because they didn't come to help Yahweh,
        to help Yahweh against the mighty.
005:024 Jael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Heber the Kenite;
        blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
005:025 He asked for water.  She gave him milk.  She brought him butter
        in a lordly dish.
005:026 She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to
        the workmen's hammer.  With the hammer she struck Sisera.
        She struck through his head.  Yes, she pierced and struck
        through his temples.
005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.  At her feet he bowed,
        he fell.  Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
005:028 Through the window she looked out, and cried:  Sisera's mother
        looked through the lattice.  Why is his chariot so long in coming?
        Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?
005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,
005:030 Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?  A lady,
        two ladies to every man; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,
        A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments
        embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
005:031 So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love
        him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength.
        The land had rest forty years.
006:001 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of
        Midian seven years.
006:002 The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of
        Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are
        in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
006:003 So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
        and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came
        up against them;
006:004 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase
        of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance
        in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
006:005 For they came up with their livestock and their tents;
        they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their
        camels were without number:  and they came into the land
        to destroy it.
006:006 Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children
        of Israel cried to Yahweh.
006:007 It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh
        because of Midian,
006:008 that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel:
        and he said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I
        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
        the house of bondage;
006:009 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
        and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them
        out from before you, and gave you their land;
006:010 and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not
        fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.
        But you have not listened to my voice.
006:011 The angel of Yahweh came, and sat under the oak which
        was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite:
        and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress,
        to hide it from the Midianites.
006:012 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him, and said to him,
        Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor.
006:013 Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then
        has all this happened to us? and where are all his wondrous
        works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Yahweh
        bring us up from Egypt? but now Yahweh has cast us off,
        and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
006:014 Yahweh looked at him, and said, Go in this your might,
        and save Israel from the hand of Midian:  have not I sent you?
006:015 He said to him, Oh, Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold,
        my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least
        in my father's house.
006:016 Yahweh said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall
        strike the Midianites as one man.
006:017 He said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight,
        then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
006:018 Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out
        my present, and lay it before you.  He said, I will wait
        until you come again.
006:019 Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
        of an ephah of meal:  the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
        the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak,
        and presented it.
006:020 The angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
        cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.
        He did so.
006:021 Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was
        in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes;
        and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh
        and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Yahweh departed
        out of his sight.
006:022 Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said,
        Alas, Lord Yahweh! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh
        face to face.
006:023 Yahweh said to him, Peace be to you; don't be afraid:
        you shall not die.
006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it
        Yahweh is Peace{or, Yahweh Shalom}: to this day it is still
        in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
006:025 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him,
        Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven years old,
        and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has,
        and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
006:026 and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold,
        in the orderly manner, and take the second bull, and offer
        a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you
        shall cut down.
006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh
        had spoken to him:  and it happened, because he feared his
        father's household and the men of the city, so that he could
        not do it by day, that he did it by night.
006:028 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
        the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut
        down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on
        the altar that was built.
006:029 They said one to another, Who has done this thing?
        When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son
        of Joash has done this thing.
006:030 Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son,
        that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal,
        and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
006:031 Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend
        for Baal?  Or will you save him? he who will contend for him,
        let him be put to death while [it is yet] morning:
        if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has
        broken down his altar.
006:032 Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
        contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.
006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children
        of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over,
        and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
006:034 But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet;
        and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
006:035 He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were
        gathered together after him:  and he sent messengers to Asher,
        and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
006:036 Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand,
        as you have spoken,
006:037 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor;
        if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground,
        then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand,
        as you have spoken.
006:038 It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed
        the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece,
        a bowl full of water.
006:039 Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me,
        and I will speak but this once:  Please let me make a trial
        just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on
        the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.
006:040 God did so that night:  for it was dry on the fleece only,
        and there was dew on all the ground.
007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him,
        rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod:
        and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them,
        by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
007:002 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are
        too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand,
        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand
        has saved me.
007:003 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is
        fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.
        There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there
        remained ten thousand.
007:004 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them
        down to the water, and I will try them for you there:
        and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you,
        the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you,
        This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
007:005 So he brought down the people to the water:  and Yahweh said
        to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue,
        as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise everyone
        who bows down on his knees to drink.
007:006 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
        was three hundred men:  but all the rest of the people bowed
        down on their knees to drink water.
007:007 Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped
        will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand;
        and let all the people go every man to his place.
007:008 So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets;
        and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent,
        but retained the three hundred men:  and the camp of Midian
        was beneath him in the valley.
007:009 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you
        down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
007:010 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant
        down to the camp:
007:011 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall
        your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp.
        Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost
        part of the armed men who were in the camp.
007:012 The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude;
        and their camels were without number, as the sand which is
        on the seashore for multitude.
007:013 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream
        to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream;
        and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp
        of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell,
        and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.
007:014 His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword
        of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:  into his hand
        God has delivered Midian, and all the army.
007:015 It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,
        and the interpretation of it, that he worshiped; and he returned
        into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has
        delivered into your hand the army of Midian.
007:016 He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put
        into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers,
        with torches within the pitchers.
007:017 He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise:  and behold,
        when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that,
        as I do, so shall you do.
007:018 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow
        you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say,
        For Yahweh and for Gideon.
007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him,
        came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning
        of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch:
        and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers
        that were in their hands.
007:020 The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers,
        and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets
        in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried,
        The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.
007:021 They stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.
007:022 They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every
        man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army;
        and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah,
        as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.
007:023 The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out
        of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
007:024 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country
        of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before
        them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
        So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took
        the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
007:025 They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they
        killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian:
        and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon
        beyond the Jordan.
008:001 The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you
        didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian?  They did
        chide with him sharply.
008:002 He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you?
        Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer?
008:003 God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb:  and what was I able to do in comparison with you?
        Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
008:004 Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
008:005 He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread
        to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am
        pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
008:006 The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
        now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?
008:007 Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna
        into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns
        of the wilderness and with briers.
008:008 He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner;
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of
        Succoth had answered.
008:009 He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again
        in peace, I will break down this tower.
008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them,
        about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army
        of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty
        thousand men who drew sword.
008:011 Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents
        on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army;
        for the army was secure.
008:012 Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them;
        and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna,
        and confused all the army.
008:013 Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from
        the ascent of Heres.
008:014 He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him:
        and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders
        of it, seventy-seven men.
008:015 He came to the men of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna,
        concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands
        of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give
        bread to your men who are weary?
008:016 He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness
        and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
008:017 He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
008:018 Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom you killed at Tabor?  They answered, As you are,
        so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
008:019 He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother:
        as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would
        not kill you.
008:020 He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them.
        But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he feared,
        because he was yet a youth.
008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us;
        for as the man is, so is his strength.  Gideon arose,
        and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that
        were on their camels' necks.
008:022 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us,
        both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you
        have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
008:023 Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall
        my son rule over you:  Yahweh shall rule over you.
008:024 Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you,
        that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil.
        (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
008:025 They answered, We will willingly give them.  They spread a garment,
        and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil.
008:026 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand
        and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, besides the crescents,
        and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on
        the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about
        their camels' necks.
008:027 Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah:
        and all Israel played the prostitute after it there;
        and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
008:028 So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they
        lifted up their heads no more.  The land had rest forty years
        in the days of Gideon.
008:029 Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
008:030 Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body;
        for he had many wives.
008:031 His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son,
        and he named him Abimelech.
008:032 Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried
        in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
008:033 It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
        Israel turned again, and played the prostitute after the Baals,
        and made Baal Berith their god.
008:034 The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God,
        who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies
        on every side;
008:035 neither shown they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
        [who is] Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
        shown to Israel.
009:001 Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his
        mother's brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family
        of the house of his mother's father, saying,
009:002 Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is
        better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are
        seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?
        Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
009:003 His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men
        of Shechem all these words:  and their hearts inclined
        to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
009:004 They gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of
        Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows,
        who followed him.
009:005 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers
        the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone:
        but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
        for he hid himself.
009:006 All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together,
        and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king,
        by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
009:007 When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top
        of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried,
        and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God
        may listen to you.
009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them;
        and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.
009:009 But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness,
        with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back
        and forth over the trees?
009:010 The trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
009:011 But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness,
        and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
009:012 The trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
009:013 The vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers
        God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
009:014 Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you,
        and reign over us.
009:015 The bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me
        king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade;
        and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour
        the cedars of Lebanon.
009:016 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously,
        in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt
        well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him
        according to the deserving of his hands
009:017 (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life,
        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
009:018 and you are risen up against my father's house this day,
        and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone,
        and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant,
        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
009:019 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal
        and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech,
        and let him also rejoice in you:
009:020 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour
        the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come
        out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
        and devour Abimelech.
009:021 Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there,
        for fear of Abimelech his brother.
009:022 Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
009:023 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;
        and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
009:024 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come,
        and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother,
        who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened
        his hands to kill his brothers.
009:025 The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains,
        and they robbed all who came along that way by them:
        and it was told Abimelech.
009:026 Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over
        to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
009:027 They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards,
        and trod [the grapes], and held festival, and went into the house
        of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
009:028 Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,
        that we should serve him?  Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul
        his officer? serve you the men of Hamor the father of Shechem:
        but why should we serve him?
009:029 Would that this people were under my hand! then would I
        remove Abimelech.  He said to Abimelech, Increase your army,
        and come out.
009:030 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
009:031 He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the
        son of Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and behold,
        they constrain the city [to take part] against you.
009:032 Now therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you,
        and lie in wait in the field:
009:033 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up,
        you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold,
        when he and the people who are with him come out against you,
        then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.
009:034 Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night,
        and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
009:035 Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of
        the gate of the city:  and Abimelech rose up, and the people
        who were with him, from the ambush.
009:036 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
        people down from the tops of the mountains.  Zebul said to him,
        You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
009:037 Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there come people down
        by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way
        of the oak of Meonenim.
009:038 Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, that you said,
        Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this
        the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray,
        and fight with them.
009:039 Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
009:040 Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell
        many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
009:041 Abimelech lived at Arumah:  and Zebul drove out Gaal and
        his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
009:042 It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field;
        and they told Abimelech.
009:043 He took the people, and divided them into three companies,
        and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold,
        the people came forth out of the city; He rose up against them,
        and struck them.
009:044 Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward,
        and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city:
        and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field,
        and struck them.
009:045 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
        the city, and killed the people who were therein:
        and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
009:046 When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it,
        they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
009:047 It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem
        were gathered together.
009:048 Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people
        who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,
        and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up,
        and laid it on his shoulder:  and he said to the people
        who were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste,
        and do as I have done.
009:049 All the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
        and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold,
        and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the men
        of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
        and took it.
009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled
        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut
        themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.
009:052 Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew
        near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
009:053 A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head,
        and broke his skull.
009:054 Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer,
        and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say
        of me, A woman killed him.  His young man thrust him through,
        and he died.
009:055 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
        every man to his place.
009:056 Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
        to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;
009:057 and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite
        on their heads:  and on them came the curse of Jotham
        the son of Jerubbaal.
010:001 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah,
        the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in Shamir
        in the hill country of Ephraim.
010:002 He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was
        buried in Shamir.
010:003 After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged
        Israel twenty-two years.
010:004 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they
        had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day,
        which are in the land of Gilead.
010:005 Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
010:006 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods
        of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods
        of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines;
        and they forsook Yahweh, and didn't serve him.
010:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand
        of the children of Ammon.
010:008 They vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year:
        eighteen years [oppressed they] all the children of Israel
        that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites,
        which is in Gilead.
010:009 The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also
        against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house
        of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
010:010 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, We have
        sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God,
        and have served the Baals.
010:011 Yahweh said to the children of Israel, Didn't I save you from
        the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon,
        and from the Philistines?
010:012 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
        did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out
        of their hand.
010:013 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods:
        therefore I will save you no more.
010:014 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save
        you in the time of your distress.
010:015 The children of Israel said to Yahweh, We have sinned:
        do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us,
        we pray you, this day.
010:016 They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh;
        and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
        in Gilead.  The children of Israel assembled themselves together,
        and encamped in Mizpah.
010:018 The people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another,
        What man is he who will begin to fight against the children
        of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor,
        and he was the son of a prostitute:  and Gilead became
        the father of Jephthah.
011:002 Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up,
        they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit
        in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman.
011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob:
        and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they
        went out with him.
011:004 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made
        war against Israel.
011:005 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
        the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
011:006 and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we
        may fight with the children of Ammon.
011:007 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Didn't you hate me,
        and drive me out of my father's house? and why are you come
        to me now when you are in distress?
011:008 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we
        turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight
        with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over
        all the inhabitants of Gilead.
011:009 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home
        again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver
        them before me, shall I be your head?
011:010 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness
        between us; surely according to your word so will we do.
011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
        made him head and chief over them:  and Jephthah spoke all
        his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
011:012 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,
        saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come to me
        to fight against my land?
011:013 The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers
        of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out
        of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan:
        now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.
011:014 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;
011:015 and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah:  Israel didn't take
        away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
011:016 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went
        through the wilderness to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        and came to Kadesh;
011:017 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let
        me pass through your land; but the king of Edom didn't listen.
        In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not:
        and Israel abode in Kadesh.
011:018 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land
        of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
        of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side
        of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab,
        for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
011:019 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass,
        we pray you, through your land to my place.
011:020 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border;
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz,
        and fought against Israel.
011:021 Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his
        people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them:
        so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants
        of that country.
011:022 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon
        even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
011:023 So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites
        from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?
011:024 Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?
        So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us,
        them will we possess.
011:025 Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor,
        king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did
        he ever fight against them?
011:026 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer
        and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side
        of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover
        them within that time?
011:027 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong
        to war against me:  Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day
        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
011:028 However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen
        to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
011:029 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed
        over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
011:030 Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
        deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
011:031 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors
        of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
        of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up
        for a burnt offering.
011:032 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight
        against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
011:033 He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty
        cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter.
        So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
011:034 Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter
        came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances:
        and she was his only child; besides her he had neither
        son nor daughter.
011:035 It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes,
        and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low,
        and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened
        my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go back.
011:036 She said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh;
        do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth,
        because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies,
        even on the children of Ammon.
011:037 She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me:
        let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on
        the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
011:038 He said, Go.  He sent her away for two months:
        and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her
        virginity on the mountains.
011:039 It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father,
        who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed:
        and she was a virgin.  It was a custom in Israel,
011:040 that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter
        of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
012:001 The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward;
        and they said to Jephthah, Why did you pass over to fight
        against the children of Ammon, and didn't call us to go
        with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.
012:002 Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife
        with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't
        save me out of their hand.
012:003 When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand,
        and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh
        delivered them into my hand:  why then are you come up to me
        this day, to fight against me?
012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead,
        and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim,
        because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites,
        in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.
012:005 The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites.
        It was so, that when [any of] the fugitives of Ephraim said,
        Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you
        an Ephraimite?  If he said, No;
012:006 then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth;
        for he couldn't manage to pronounce it right:  then they laid
        hold on him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan.
        There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.
012:007 Jephthah judged Israel six years.  Then died Jephthah the Gileadite,
        and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gilead.
012:008 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
012:009 He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad,
        and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons.
        He judged Israel seven years.
012:010 Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
012:011 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged
        Israel ten years.
012:012 Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
        land of Zebulun.
012:013 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
012:014 He had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, who rode on seventy
        donkey colts:  and he judged Israel eight years.
012:015 Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried
        in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country
        of the Amalekites.
013:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in
        the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand
        of the Philistines forty years.
013:002 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
        whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and didn't bear.
013:003 The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and said to her,
        See now, you are barren, and don't bear; but you shall conceive,
        and bear a son.
013:004 Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink,
        and don't eat any unclean thing:
013:005 for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
        shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite
        to God from the womb:  and he shall begin to save Israel
        out of the hand of the Philistines.
013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
        came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel
        of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him whence he was,
        neither did he tell me his name:
013:007 but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son;
        and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any
        unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God
        from the womb to the day of his death.
013:008 Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, Oh, Lord, please let
        the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach
        us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.
013:009 God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
        came again to the woman as she sat in the field:
        but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her.
013:010 The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said
        to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me
        the [other] day.
013:011 Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,
        and said to him, Are you the man who spoke to the woman?
        He said, I am.
013:012 Manoah said, Now let your words happen:  what shall be the ordering
        of the child, and [how] shall we do to him?
013:013 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said
        to the woman let her beware.
013:014 She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let
        her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing;
        all that I commanded her let her observe.
013:015 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you,
        that we may make ready a kid for you.
013:016 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me,
        I won't eat of your bread; and if you will make ready
        a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.
        For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of Yahweh.
013:017 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, What is your name,
        that when your words happen, we may honor you?
013:018 The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why do you ask after my name,
        seeing it is wonderful?
013:019 So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered
        it on the rock to Yahweh:  and [the angel] did wondrously,
        and Manoah and his wife looked on.
013:020 For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky
        from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in
        the flame of the altar:  and Manoah and his wife looked on;
        and they fell on their faces to the ground.
013:021 But the angel of Yahweh did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife.
        Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh.
013:022 Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we
        have seen God.
013:023 But his wife said to him, If Yahweh were pleased to kill us,
        he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering
        at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things,
        nor would at this time have told such things as these.
013:024 The woman bore a son, and named him Samson:  and the child grew,
        and Yahweh blessed him.
013:025 The Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan,
        between Zorah and Eshtaol.
014:001 Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of
        the daughters of the Philistines.
014:002 He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
        I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines:
        now therefore get her for me as wife.
014:003 Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there
        never a woman among the daughters of your brothers,
        or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of
        the uncircumcised Philistines?  Samson said to his father,
        Get her for me; for she pleases me well.
014:004 But his father and his mother didn't know that it was of Yahweh;
        for he sought an occasion against the Philistines.
        Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother,
        to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah:  and behold,
        a young lion roared against him.
014:006 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him
        as he would have torn a kid; and he had nothing in his hand:
        but he didn't tell his father or his mother what he had done.
014:007 He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
014:008 After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside
        to see the carcass of the lion:  and behold, there was a swarm
        of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
014:009 He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went;
        and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them,
        and they ate:  but he didn't tell them that he had taken
        the honey out of the body of the lion.
014:010 His father went down to the woman:  and Samson made there a feast;
        for so used the young men to do.
014:011 It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
        companions to be with him.
014:012 Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you:
        if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast,
        and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments
        and thirty changes of clothing;
014:013 but if you can't declare it to me, then shall you give me
        thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.
        They said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.
014:014 He said to them, Out of the eater came forth food.
        Out of the strong came forth sweetness.  They couldn't
        in three days declare the riddle.
014:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife,
        Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle,
        lest we burn you and your father's house with fire:
        have you called us to impoverish us? is it not [so]?
014:016 Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me,
        and don't love me:  you have put forth a riddle
        to the children of my people, and haven't told it me.
        He said to her, Behold, I haven't told it my father nor my mother,
        and shall I tell you?
014:017 She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:
        and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her,
        because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle
        to the children of her people.
014:018 The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun
        went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than
        a lion?  He said to them, If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,
        you wouldn't have found out my riddle.
014:019 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down
        to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
        and gave the changes [of clothing] to those who declared the riddle.
        His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
014:020 But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had
        used as his friend.
015:001 But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest,
        that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
        I will go in to my wife into the chamber.  But her father
        wouldn't allow him to go in.
015:002 Her father said, I most certainly thought that you had
        utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion:
        isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she?
        Please take her, instead.
015:003 Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard
        of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
015:004 Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
        and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst
        between every two tails.
015:005 When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
        the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both
        the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who has done this?  They said, Samson,
        the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife,
        and given her to his companion.  The Philistines came up,
        and burnt her and her father with fire.
015:007 Samson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I
        will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
015:008 He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter:
        and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread
        themselves in Lehi.
015:010 The men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us?
        They said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him
        as he has done to us.
015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock
        of Etam, and said to Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines
        are rulers over us?  What then is this that you have done to us?"
        He said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
015:012 They said to him, We have come down to bind you, that we
        may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.
        Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall
        on me yourselves.
015:013 They spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast,
        and deliver you into their hand:  but surely we will not kill you.
        They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up
        from the rock.
015:014 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him:
        and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and the ropes
        that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire,
        and his bands dropped from off his hands.
015:015 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand,
        and took it, and struck a thousand men therewith.
015:016 Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps,
        With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.
015:017 It happened, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast
        away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was
        called Ramath Lehi.
015:018 He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, You have
        given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant;
        and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand
        of the uncircumcised.
015:019 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out
        of it.  When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived:
        therefore the name of it was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi,
        to this day.
015:020 He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
016:001 Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went
        in to her.
016:002 [It was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here.
        They compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate
        of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, [Let be]
        until morning light, then we will kill him.
016:003 Samson lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid
        hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts,
        and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders,
        and carried them up to the top of the mountain that
        is before Hebron.
016:004 It came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley
        of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
016:005 The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her,
        Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies,
        and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind
        him to afflict him:  and we will each give you of us eleven
        hundred [pieces] of silver.
016:006 Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, Please, in which your great
        strength lies, and with which you might be bound to afflict you.
016:007 Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green cords
        that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be
        as another man.
016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
        cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
016:009 Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner chamber.
        She said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!"  He broke
        the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire.
        So his strength was not known.
016:010 Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies:
        now tell me, Please, with which you might be bound.
016:011 He said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes with
        which no work has been done, then shall I become weak,
        and be as another man.
016:012 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith,
        and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson.
        The ambush was waiting in the inner chamber.  He broke them
        off his arms like a thread.
016:013 Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me,
        and told me lies:  tell me with which you might be bound.
        He said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head
        with the web.
016:014 She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines
        are on you, Samson.  He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked
        away the pin of the beam, and the web.
016:015 She said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart
        is not with me? you have mocked me these three times,
        and have not told me in which your great strength lies.
016:016 It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words,
        and urged him, that his soul was vexed to death.
016:017 He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever
        come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my
        mother's womb.  If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me,
        and I will become weak, and be like any other man."
016:018 When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart,
        she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying,
        Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.
        Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought
        the money in their hand.
016:019 She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man,
        and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began
        to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
016:020 She said, The Philistines are on you, Samson.  He awoke out
        of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times,
        and shake myself free.  But he didn't know that Yahweh had
        departed from him.
016:021 The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they
        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
        and he ground at the mill in the prison.
016:022 However the hair of his head began to grow again after
        he was shaved.
016:023 The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer
        a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice;
        for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy
        into our hand.
016:024 When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said,
        Our god has delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer
        of our country, who has slain many of us.
016:025 It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
        Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.  They called
        for Samson out of the prison; and he made sport before them.
        They set him between the pillars:
016:026 and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, Allow me
        that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house rests,
        that I may lean on them.
016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
        of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about
        three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson made sport.
016:028 Samson called to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, remember me,
        Please, and strengthen me, Please, only this once, God, that I
        may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
016:029 Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the
        house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand,
        and the other with his left.
016:030 Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.
        He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell
        on the lords, and on all the people who were therein.
        So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those
        who he killed in his life.
016:031 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down,
        and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between
        Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father.
        He judged Israel twenty years.
017:001 There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
017:002 He said to his mother, The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver
        that were taken from you, about which you did utter a curse,
        and did also speak it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me;
        I took it.  His mother said, Blessed be my son of Yahweh.
017:003 He restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother;
        and his mother said, I most certainly dedicate the silver
        to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image
        and a molten image:  now therefore I will restore it to you.
017:004 When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took
        two hundred [pieces] of silver, and gave them to the founder,
        who made of it an engraved image and a molten image:
        and it was in the house of Micah.
017:005 The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,
        and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.
017:007 There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family
        of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
017:008 The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah,
        to sojourn where he could find [a place], and he came
        to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah,
        as he traveled.
017:009 Micah said to him, Whence come you?  He said to him, I am
        a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I go to sojourn where I
        may find [a place].
017:010 Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father
        and a priest, and I will give you ten [pieces] of silver
        by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your food.
        So the Levite went in.
017:011 The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
        man was to him as one of his sons.
017:012 Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest,
        and was in the house of Micah.
017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that Yahweh will do me good,
        seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel:  and in those days
        the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in;
        for to that day [their] inheritance had not fallen to them
        among the tribes of Israel.
018:002 The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
        whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,
        to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them,
        Go, search the land.  They came to the hill country of Ephraim,
        to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice
        of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there,
        and said to him, Who brought you here? and what do you in this
        place? and what have you here?
018:004 He said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me,
        and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.
018:005 They said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we
        may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
018:006 The priest said to them, Go in peace:  before Yahweh is your
        way wherein you go.
018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw
        the people who were therein, how they lived in security,
        after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure;
        for there was none in the land, possessing authority,
        that might put [them] to shame in anything, and they were far
        from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
018:008 They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol:
        and their brothers said to them, What [say] you?
018:009 They said, Arise, and let us go up against them;
        for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good:
        and are you still? don't be slothful to go and to enter
        in to possess the land.
018:010 When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land
        is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place
        where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.
018:011 There set forth from there of the family of the Danites,
        out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with
        weapons of war.
018:012 They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah:
        therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day;
        behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.
018:013 They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came
        to the house of Micah.
018:014 Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered,
        and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in
        these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image,
        and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.
018:015 They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young
        man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him
        of his welfare.
018:016 The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were
        of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
018:017 The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came
        in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod,
        and the teraphim, and the molten image:  and the priest stood
        by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt
        with weapons of war.
018:018 When these went into Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image,
        the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest
        said to them, What do you?
018:019 They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth,
        and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
        is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man,
        or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
018:020 The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim,
        and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.
018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and
        the livestock and the goods before them.
018:022 When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who
        were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together,
        and overtook the children of Dan.
018:023 They cried to the children of Dan.  They turned their faces,
        and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with
        such a company?
018:024 He said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest,
        and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say
        you to me, What ails you?
018:025 The children of Dan said to him, "Don't let your voice be heard
        among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life,
        with the lives of your household."
018:026 The children of Dan went their way:  and when Micah saw
        that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
        to his house.
018:027 They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom
        he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure,
        and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt
        the city with fire.
018:028 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon,
        and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in
        the valley that lies by Beth Rehob.  They built the city,
        and lived therein.
018:029 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
        their father, who was born to Israel:  however the name
        of the city was Laish at the first.
018:030 The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image:
        and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his
        sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day
        of the captivity of the land.
018:031 So they set them up Micah's engraved image which he made,
        all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
019:001 It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
        that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side
        of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine
        out of Bethlehem Judah.
019:002 His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went
        away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem Judah,
        and was there the space of four months.
019:003 Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her,
        to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple
        of donkeys:  and she brought him into her father's house;
        and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced
        to meet him.
019:004 His father-in-law, the young lady's father, retained him;
        and he abode with him three days:  so they ate and drink,
        and lodged there.
019:005 It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning,
        and he rose up to depart:  and the young lady's father said
        to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread,
        and afterward you shall go your way.
019:006 So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together:
        and the young lady's father said to the man, Please be pleased
        to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.
019:007 The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him,
        and he lodged there again.
019:008 He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
        and the young lady's father said, Please strengthen your heart
        and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.
019:009 When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine,
        and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady's father,
        said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening,
        please stay all night:  behold, the day grows to an end,
        lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get
        you early on your way, that you may go home.
019:010 But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed,
        and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem):
        and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled;
        his concubine also was with him.
019:011 When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant
        said to his master, Please come and let us turn aside into
        this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
019:012 His master said to him, We won't turn aside into the city
        of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel;
        but we will pass over to Gibeah.
019:013 He said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one
        of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
019:014 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
        on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
019:015 They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah:
        and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city;
        for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.
019:016 Behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even:
        now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned
        in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
019:017 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street
        of the city; and the old man said, Where go you? and
        whence come you?
019:018 He said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther
        side of the hill country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went
        to Bethlehem Judah:  and I am [now] going to the house of Yahweh;
        and there is no man who takes me into his house.
019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys;
        and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid,
        and for the young man who is with your servants:
        there is no want of anything.
019:020 The old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants
        lie on me; only don't lodge in the street.
019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder;
        and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.
019:022 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
        the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about,
        beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house,
        the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house,
        that we may know him.
019:023 The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said
        to them, No, my brothers, please don't act so wickedly;
        seeing that this man is come into my house, don't do this folly.
019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine;
        them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do
        with them what seems good to you:  but to this man don't
        do any such folly.
019:025 But the men wouldn't listen to him:  so the man laid hold
        on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they
        knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning:
        and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell
        down at the door of the man's house where her lord was,
        until it was light.
019:027 Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
        the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman
        his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house,
        with her hands on the threshold.
019:028 He said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered:
        then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up,
        and got him to his place.
019:029 When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on
        his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces,
        and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
019:030 It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed
        done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came
        up out of the land of Egypt to this day:  consider it,
        take counsel, and speak.
020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
        was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.
020:002 The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,
        presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,
        four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.
020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
        had gone up to Mizpah.)  The children of Israel said, Tell us,
        how was this wickedness brought to pass?
020:004 The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered,
        answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and
        my concubine, to lodge.
020:005 The men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
        round about me by night; me they thought to have slain,
        and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.
020:006 I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
        throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel;
        for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
020:007 Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your
        advice and counsel.
020:008 All the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us
        go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.
020:009 But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah:
        [we will go up] against it by lot;
020:010 and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all
        the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand,
        and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people,
        that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,
        according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.
020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city,
        knit together as one man.
020:012 The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
        saying, What wickedness is this that is happen among you?
020:013 Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah,
        that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.
        But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers
        the children of Israel.
020:014 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
        out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against
        the children of Israel.
020:015 The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out
        of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword,
        besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven
        hundred chosen men.
020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen
        men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth,
        and not miss.
020:017 The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred
        thousand men who drew sword:  all these were men of war.
020:018 The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked
        counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first
        to battle against the children of Benjamin?  Yahweh said,
        Judah [shall go up] first.
020:019 The children of Israel rose up in the morning,
        and encamped against Gibeah.
020:020 The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin;
        and the men of Israel set the battle in array against
        them at Gibeah.
020:021 The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah,
        and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day
        Twenty-two thousand men.
020:022 The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves,
        and set the battle again in array in the place where they
        set themselves in array the first day.
020:023 The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until even;
        and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near
        to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?
        Yahweh said, Go up against him.
020:024 The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin
        the second day.
020:025 Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day,
        and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel
        again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
        and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh,
        and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt
        offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
020:027 The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant
        of God was there in those days,
020:028 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before
        it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle
        against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?
        Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him
        into your hand.
020:029 Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.
020:030 The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin
        on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah,
        as at other times.
020:031 The children of Benjamin went out against the people,
        and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike
        and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways,
        of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah,
        in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
020:032 The children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us,
        as at the first.  But the children of Israel said, Let us flee,
        and draw them away from the city to the highways.
020:033 All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set
        themselves in array at Baal Tamar:  and the ambushers of Israel
        broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.
020:034 There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out
        of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they didn't know
        that evil was close on them.
020:035 Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel
        destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men:
        all these drew the sword.
020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck;
        for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they
        trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
020:037 The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers
        drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge
        of the sword.
020:038 Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers
        was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up
        out of the city.
020:039 The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began
        to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons;
        for they said, Surely they are struck down before us,
        as in the first battle.
020:040 But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar
        of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold,
        the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.
020:041 The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed;
        for they saw that evil had come on them.
020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
        to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard
        after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed
        them in the midst of it.
020:043 They enclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them,
        [and] trod them down at [their] resting place, as far as over
        against Gibeah toward the sunrise.
020:044 There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were]
        men of valor.
020:045 They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon:
        and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men,
        and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them
        two thousand men.
020:046 So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five
        thousand men who drew the sword; all these [were] men of valor.
020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to
        the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
020:048 The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin,
        and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the
        entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found:
        moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall
        not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife.
021:002 The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God,
        and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.
021:003 They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel,
        that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?
021:004 It happened on the next day that the people rose early,
        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings.
021:005 The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes
        of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh?  For they
        had made a great oath concerning him who didn't come up
        to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
021:006 The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother,
        and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
021:007 How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we
        have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our
        daughters to wives?
021:008 They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't
        come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?  Behold, there came none
        to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.
021:009 For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none
        of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.
021:010 The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant,
        and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants
        of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women
        and the little ones.
021:011 This is the thing that you shall do:  you shall utterly destroy
        every male, and every woman who has lain by man.
021:012 They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred
        young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him;
        and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in
        the land of Canaan.
021:013 The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin
        who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
021:014 Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women
        whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead:
        and yet so they weren't enough for them.
021:015 The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made
        a breach in the tribes of Israel.
021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
        wives for those who remain, seeing the women are destroyed
        out of Benjamin?
021:017 They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped
        of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.
021:018 However we may not give them wives of our daughters,
        for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be
        he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
021:019 They said, Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year
        in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east
        side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem,
        and on the south of Lebonah.
021:020 They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie
        in wait in the vineyards,
021:021 and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out
        to dance in the dances, then come you out of the vineyards,
        and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh,
        and go to the land of Benjamin.
021:022 It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain
        to us, that we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us,
        because we didn't take for each man his wife in battle,
        neither did you give them to them, else would you now be guilty.
021:023 The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to
        their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off:
        and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built
        the cities, and lived in them.
021:024 The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man
        to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there
        every man to his inheritance.
021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.
Book 08 Ruth
001:001 It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there
        was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah
        went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife,
        and his two sons.
001:002 The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi,
        and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
        Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab,
        and continued there.
001:003 Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left,
        and her two sons.
001:004 They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name
        of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth:
        and they lived there about ten years.
001:005 Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left
        of her two children and of her husband.
001:006 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
        from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab
        how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.
001:007 She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two
        daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return
        to the land of Judah.
001:008 Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each
        of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you,
        as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
001:009 Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house
        of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept.
001:010 They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.
001:011 Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me?
        have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have
        a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even
        have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;
001:013 would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you
        therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters,
        for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh
        is gone forth against me.
001:014 They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed
        her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.
001:015 She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people,
        and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.
001:016 Ruth said, "Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return
        from following after you, for where you go, I will go;
        and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people,
        and your God my God;
001:017 where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried:
        Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part
        you and me."
001:018 When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her,
        she left off speaking to her.
001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened,
        when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved
        about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?
001:020 She said to them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara;
        for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
001:021 I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty;
        why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me,
        and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,
        with her, who returned out of the country of Moab:
        and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
002:001 Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
        of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
002:002 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field,
        and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight
        I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.
002:003 She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
        and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging
        to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
002:004 Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers,
        Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.
002:005 Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers,
        Whose young lady is this?
002:006 The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite
        lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
002:007 She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers
        among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even
        from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little
        in the house.
002:008 Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter?
        Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence,
        but abide here fast by my maidens.
002:009 Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them:
        haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch
        you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink
        of that which the young men have drawn.
002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight,
        that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
002:011 Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you
        have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband;
        and how you have left your father and your mother,
        and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you
        didn't know before.
002:012 Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come
        to take refuge.
002:013 Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord,
        because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly
        to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.
002:014 At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread,
        and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers,
        and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed,
        and left of it.
002:015 When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his
        young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves,
        and don't reproach her.
002:016 Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it,
        and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.
002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that
        which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
002:018 She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law
        saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave
        to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
002:019 Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and
        where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you.
        She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said,
        The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
002:020 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh,
        who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.
        Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us,
        one of our near kinsmen.
002:021 Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep
        fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
002:022 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter,
        that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you
        in any other field.
002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived
        with her mother-in-law.
003:001 Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I
        not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
003:002 Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were?
        Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.
003:003 Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing
        on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't
        make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done
        eating and drinking.
003:004 It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place
        where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet,
        and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
003:005 She said to her, All that you say I will do.
003:006 She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all
        that her mother-in-law told her.
003:007 When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,
        he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain:
        and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
003:008 It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself;
        and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
003:009 He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid:
        spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are
        a near kinsman.
003:010 He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter:
        you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at
        the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men,
        whether poor or rich.
003:011 Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that
        you say; for all the city of my people does know that you
        are a worthy woman.
003:012 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is
        a kinsman nearer than I.
003:013 Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
        perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the
        kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you,
        then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives:
        lie down until the morning.
003:014 She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before
        one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known
        that the woman came to the threshing floor.
003:015 He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it;
        and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley,
        and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.
003:016 When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you,
        my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.
003:017 She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said,
        "Don't go empty to your mother-in-law."
003:018 Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how
        the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has
        finished the thing this day."
004:001 Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there:
        and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by;
        to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.
        He turned aside, and sat down.
004:002 He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you
        down here.  They sat down.
004:003 He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out
        of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land,
        which was our brother Elimelech's:
004:004 I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before
        those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.
        If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not
        redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there
        is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.
        He said, I will redeem it.
004:005 Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi,
        you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead,
        to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.
004:006 The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you;
        for I can't redeem it.
004:007 Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things:
        a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor;
        and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.
004:008 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself.
        He drew off his shoe.
004:009 Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses
        this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's,
        and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead
        on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off
        from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place:
        you are witnesses this day.
004:011 All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We
        are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house
        like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel:
        and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
004:012 and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar
        bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you
        of this young woman.
004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her,
        and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.
004:014 The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left
        you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be
        famous in Israel.
004:015 He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you
        in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you,
        who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.
004:016 Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse to it.
004:017 The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son
        born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father
        of Jesse, the father of David.
004:018 Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became
        the father of Hezron,
004:019 and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became
        the father of Amminadab,
004:020 and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became
        the father of Salmon,
004:021 and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became
        the father of Obed,
004:022 and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became
        the father of David.
Book 09 1 Samuel
001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim,
        of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah,
        the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu,
        the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
001:002 and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah,
        and the name of other Peninnah:  and Peninnah had children,
        but Hannah had no children.
001:003 This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship
        and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh.  The two sons
        of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.
001:004 When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah
        his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
001:005 but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah,
        but Yahweh had shut up her womb.
001:006 Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh
        had shut up her womb.
001:007 [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
        of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept,
        and did not eat.
001:008 Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why
        don't you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better
        to you than ten sons?
001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
        they had drunk.  Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat
        by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.
001:010 She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh,
        and wept sore.
001:011 She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed
        look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me,
        and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid
        a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life,
        and there shall no razor come on his head.
001:012 It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli
        marked her mouth.
001:013 Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved,
        but her voice was not heard:  therefore Eli thought she
        had been drunken.
001:014 Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your
        wine from you.
001:015 Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit:
        I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured
        out my soul before Yahweh.
001:016 Don't count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out
        of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have
        I spoken hitherto.
001:017 Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant
        your petition that you have asked of him.
001:018 She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.
        So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression
        wasn't sad any more.
001:019 They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh,
        and returned, and came to their house to Ramah:
        and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.
001:020 It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived,
        and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I
        have asked him of Yahweh.
001:021 The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh
        the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
001:022 But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not
        go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him,
        that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.
001:023 Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good;
        wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word.
        So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.
001:024 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her,
        with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle
        of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh:
        and the child was young.
001:025 They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.
001:026 She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am
        the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.
001:027 For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition
        which I asked of him:
001:028 therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives
        he is granted to Yahweh.  He worshiped Yahweh there.
002:001 Hannah prayed, and said:  My heart exults in Yahweh!  My horn
        is exalted in Yahweh.  My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,
        because I rejoice in your salvation.
002:002 There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you,
        nor is there any rock like our God.
002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly.  Don't let arrogance
        come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.
        By him actions are weighed.
002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken.  Those who stumbled
        are girded with strength.
002:005 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.
        Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]. Yes, the barren
        has borne seven.  She who has many children languishes.
002:006 Yahweh kills, and makes alive.  He brings down to Sheol,
        and brings up.
002:007 Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.  He brings low,
        he also lifts up.
002:008 He raises up the poor out of the dust.  He lifts up the needy
        from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit
        the throne of glory, for the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's.
        He has set the world on them.
002:009 He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put
        to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.
002:010 Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.
        He will thunder against them in the sky.  Yahweh will judge
        the ends of the earth.  He will give strength to his king,
        and exalt the horn of his anointed.
002:011 Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.  The child did minister
        to Yahweh before Eli the priest.
002:012 Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.
002:013 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man
        offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh
        was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
002:014 and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
        all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith.
        So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
002:015 Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said
        to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;
        for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.
002:016 If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first,
        and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say,
        No, but you shall give it me now:  and if not, I will take
        it by force.
002:017 The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh;
        for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.
002:018 But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child,
        girded with a linen ephod.
002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it
        to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband
        to offer the yearly sacrifice.
002:020 Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed
        of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.
        They went to their own home.
002:021 Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons
        and two daughters.  The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.
002:022 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did
        to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served
        at the door of the tent of meeting.
002:023 He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your
        evil dealings from all this people.
002:024 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear:
        you make Yahweh's people to disobey.
002:025 If one man sin against another, God shall judge him;
        but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?
        Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father,
        because Yahweh was minded to kill them.
002:026 The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh,
        and also with men.
002:027 There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says
        Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father,
        when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?
002:028 and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be
        my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear
        an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father
        all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
002:029 Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have
        commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me,
        to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings
        of Israel my people?
002:030 Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed
        that your house, and the house of your father, should walk
        before me forever:  but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me;
        for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise
        me shall be lightly esteemed.
002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm
        of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man
        in your house.
002:032 You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth
        which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old
        man in your house forever.
002:033 The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar,
        [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart;
        and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower
        of their age.
002:034 This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons,
        on Hophni and Phinehas:  in one day they shall die both of them.
002:035 I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
        according to that which is in my heart and in my mind:
        and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before
        my anointed forever.
002:036 It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall
        come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf
        of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests'
        offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
003:001 The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli.
        The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was
        no frequent vision.
003:002 It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place
        (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),
003:003 and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had laid
        down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark
        of God was;
003:004 that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.
003:005 He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.
        He said, I didn't call; lie down again.  He went and lay down.
003:006 Yahweh called yet again, Samuel.  Samuel arose and went to Eli,
        and said, Here am I; for you called me.  He answered,
        I didn't call, my son; lie down again.
003:007 Now Samuel didn't yet know Yahweh, neither was the word
        of Yahweh yet revealed to him.
003:008 Yahweh called Samuel again the third time.  He arose
        and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.
        Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.
003:009 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down:  and it shall be,
        if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your
        servant hears.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
003:010 Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.
        Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.
003:011 Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
        at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken
        concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.
003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever,
        for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring
        a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them.
003:014 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity
        of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice
        nor offering forever.
003:015 Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house
        of Yahweh.  Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.
        He said, Here am I.
003:017 He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you?
        Please don't hide it from me.  God do so to you, and more also,
        if you hide anything from me of all the things that he
        spoke to you."
003:018 Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.
        He said, It is Yahweh:  let him do what seems him good.
003:019 Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his
        words fall to the ground.
003:020 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
        established to be a prophet of Yahweh.
003:021 Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself
        to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.
004:001 The word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out
        against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer:
        and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
004:002 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
        and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before
        the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field
        about four thousand men.
004:003 When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said,
        Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines?  Let us
        get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us,
        that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand
        of our enemies.
004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits [above] the cherubim:
        and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there
        with the ark of the covenant of God.
004:005 When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp,
        all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
004:006 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
        What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of
        the Hebrews?  They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come
        into the camp.
004:007 The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
        into the camp.  They said, Woe to us! for there has not been
        such a thing heretofore.
004:008 Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
        gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all
        manner of plagues in the wilderness.
004:009 Be strong, and behave yourselves like men, O you Philistines,
        that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
        quit yourselves like men, and fight.
004:010 The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled
        every man to his tent:  and there was a very great slaughter;
        for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
004:011 The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
        and Phinehas, were slain.
004:012 There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh
        the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.
004:013 When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the
        road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God.
        When the man came into the city, and told it, all the
        city cried out.
004:014 When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means
        the noise of this tumult?  The man hurried, and came
        and told Eli.
004:015 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set,
        so that he could not see.
004:016 The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled
        today out of the army.  He said, How went the matter, my son?
004:017 He who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before
        the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter
        among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas,
        are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
004:018 It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli]
        fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate;
        and his neck broke, and he died:  for he was an old man, and heavy.
        He had judged Israel forty years.
004:019 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,
        near to be delivered:  and when she heard the news that
        the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her
        husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth;
        for her pains came on her.
004:020 About the time of her death the women who stood by her said
        to her, Don't be afraid; for you have brought forth a son.
        But she didn't answer, neither did she regard it.
004:021 She named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
        from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because
        of her father-in-law and her husband.
004:022 She said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark
        of God is taken.
005:001 Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought
        it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
005:002 The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into
        the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
005:003 When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was
        fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh.
        They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
005:004 When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was
        fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh;
        and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay]
        cut off on the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was
        left to him.
005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into
        Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,
        to this day.
005:006 But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod,
        and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod
        and the borders of it.
005:007 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said,
        The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us;
        for his hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.
005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
        to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God
        of Israel?  They answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel
        be carried about to Gath.  They carried the ark of the God
        of Israel [there].
005:009 It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand
        of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion:
        and he struck the men of the city, both small and great;
        and tumors broke out on them.
005:010 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  It happened, as the ark
        of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
        They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us,
        to kill us and our people.
005:011 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of
        the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God
        of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it
        not kill us and our people.  For there was a deadly confusion
        throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
005:012 The men who didn't die were struck with the tumors;
        and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
006:001 The ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
006:002 The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
        saying, "What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh?  Show us
        with which we shall send it to its place."
006:003 They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don't send
        it empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering:
        then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why
        his hand is not removed from you."
006:004 Then they said, "What shall be the trespass offering which we
        shall return to him?"  They said, "Five golden tumors,
        and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords
        of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all,
        and on your lords.
006:005 Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your
        mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God
        of Israel:  peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you,
        and from off your gods, and from off your land.
006:006 Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh
        hardened their hearts?  When he had worked wonderfully among them,
        didn't they let the people go, and they departed?
006:007 Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart,
        and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie
        the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
006:008 and take the ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put
        the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering,
        in a coffer by the side of it; and send it away, that it may go.
006:009 Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to
        Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil:  but if not,
        then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us;
        it was a chance that happened to us."
006:010 The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart,
        and shut up their calves at home;
006:011 and they put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer
        with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
006:012 The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh;
        they went along the highway, lowing as they went,
        and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left;
        and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border
        of Beth Shemesh.
006:013 They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley;
        and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced
        to see it.
006:014 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh,
        and stood there, where there was a great stone:
        and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows
        for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
006:015 The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that
        was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them
        on the great stone:  and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt
        offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.
006:016 When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned
        to Ekron the same day.
006:017 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for
        a trespass offering to Yahweh:  for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,
        for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
006:018 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
        of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified
        cities and of country villages, even to the great stone,
        whereon they set down the ark of Yahweh, [which stone remains]
        to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
006:019 He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked
        into the ark of Yahweh, he struck of the people fifty thousand
        seventy men; and the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck
        the people with a great slaughter.
006:020 The men of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Yahweh,
        this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
006:021 They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim,
        saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Yahweh;
        come you down, and bring it up to you.
007:001 The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Yahweh,
        and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,
        and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Yahweh.
007:002 It happened, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath Jearim,
        that the time was long; for it was twenty years:
        and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
007:003 Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you
        do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away
        the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you,
        and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only;
        and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth,
        and served Yahweh only.
007:005 Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray
        for you to Yahweh."
007:006 They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured
        it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there,
        "We have sinned against Yahweh."  Samuel judged the children
        of Israel in Mizpah.
007:007 When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
        gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went
        up against Israel.  When the children of Israel heard it,
        they were afraid of the Philistines.
007:008 The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Don't cease to cry
        to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand
        of the Philistines."
007:009 Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt
        offering to Yahweh:  and Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel;
        and Yahweh answered him.
007:010 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
        drew near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a
        great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them;
        and they were struck down before Israel.
007:011 The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines,
        and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.
007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen,
        and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto has
        Yahweh helped us.
007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within
        the border of Israel:  and the hand of Yahweh was against
        the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
007:014 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
        restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the border
        of it did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines.
        There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
007:015 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
007:016 He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal,
        and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
007:017 His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there
        he judged Israel:  and he built there an altar to Yahweh.
008:001 It happened, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
        judges over Israel.
008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of
        his second, Abijah:  they were judges in Beersheba.
008:003 His sons didn't walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
        and took bribes, and perverted justice.
008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
        and came to Samuel to Ramah;
008:005 and they said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons
        don't walk in your ways:  now make us a king to judge us
        like all the nations.
008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king
        to judge us.  Samuel prayed to Yahweh.
008:007 Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people
        in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you,
        but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.
008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
        that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day,
        in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods,
        so do they also to you.
008:009 Now therefore listen to their voice:  however you shall protest
        solemnly to them, and shall show them the manner of the king
        who shall reign over them.
008:010 Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked
        of him a king.
008:011 He said, This will be the manner of the king who shall reign
        over you:  he will take your sons, and appoint them to him,
        for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run
        before his chariots;
008:012 and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands,
        and captains of fifties; and [he will set some] to plow his ground,
        and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war,
        and the instruments of his chariots.
008:013 He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks,
        and to be bakers.
008:014 He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves,
        even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
008:015 He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
        and give to his officers, and to his servants.
008:016 He will take your male servants, and your female servants,
        and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them
        to his work.
008:017 He will take the tenth of your flocks:  and you shall
        be his servants.
008:018 You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall
        have chosen you; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.
008:019 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel;
        and they said, No:  but we will have a king over us,
008:020 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king
        may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
008:021 Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
        them in the ears of Yahweh.
008:022 Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king.
        Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go you every man to his city.
009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
        of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son
        of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
009:002 He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man;
        and there was not among the children of Israel a better
        person than he.  From his shoulders and upward he was higher
        than any of the people.
009:003 The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost.  Kish said
        to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you,
        and arise, go seek the donkeys.
009:004 He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed
        through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them:
        then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they
        weren't there:  and he passed through the land of the Benjamites,
        but they didn't find them.
009:005 When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
        who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father
        leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.
009:006 He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God,
        and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes
        surely to pass:  now let us go there; peradventure he can
        tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
        we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
        and there is not a present to bring to the man of God:
        what have we?
009:008 The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
        in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver:
        that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
009:009 (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God,
        thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is
        now called a Prophet was before called a Seer.)
009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.
        So they went to the city where the man of God was.
009:011 As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens
        going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
009:012 They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you:
        make haste now, for he is come today into the city;
        for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:
009:013 as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately
        find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat;
        for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless
        the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat who are invited.
        Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find him.
009:014 They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city,
        behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
009:015 Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
009:016 Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land
        of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my
        people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand
        of the Philistines:  for I have looked on my people,
        because their cry is come to me.
009:017 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man
        of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority
        over my people.
009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said,
        Tell me, Please, where the seer's house is.
009:019 Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before
        me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today:
        and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all
        that is in your heart.
009:020 As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago,
        don't set your mind on them; for they are found.
        For whom is all that is desirable in Israel?  Is it not for you,
        and for all your father's house?
009:021 Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest
        of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all
        the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you
        to me after this manner?
009:022 Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
        the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among
        those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.
009:023 Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you,
        of which I said to you, Set it by you.
009:024 The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it
        before Saul.  [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved!
        set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has
        it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people.
        So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
009:025 When they were come down from the high place into the city,
        he talked with Saul on the housetop.
009:026 They arose early:  and it happened about the spring of the day,
        that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I
        may send you away.  Saul arose, and they went out both of them,
        he and Samuel, abroad.
009:027 As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said
        to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on),
        but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear
        the word of God.
010:001 Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head,
        and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed
        you to be prince over his inheritance?
010:002 When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men
        by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they
        will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found;
        and behold, your father has left off caring for the donkeys,
        and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
010:003 Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall
        come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there
        three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids,
        and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying
        a bottle of wine:
010:004 and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread,
        which you shall receive of their hand.
010:005 After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is
        the garrison of the Philistines:  and it shall happen,
        when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a band
        of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery,
        and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
        and they will be prophesying:
010:006 and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall
        prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
010:007 Let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do
        as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.
010:008 You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come
        down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice
        sacrifices of peace offerings:  seven days shall you wait,
        until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.
010:009 It was so, that when he had turned his back to go
        from Samuel, God gave him another heart:  and all those signs
        happened that day.
010:010 When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets
        met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him,
        and he prophesied among them.
010:011 It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold,
        he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one
        to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish?  Is Saul
        also among the prophets?
010:012 One of the same place answered, Who is their father?
        Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
010:013 When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
010:014 Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you?
        He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they
        were not found, we came to Samuel.
010:015 Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.
010:016 Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys
        were found.  But concerning the matter of the kingdom,
        of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.
010:017 Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;
010:018 and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt,
        and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
        and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:
010:019 but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves
        you out of all your calamities and your distresses;
        and you have said to him, [No], but set a king over us.
        Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes,
        and by your thousands.
010:020 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe
        of Benjamin was taken.
010:021 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families;
        and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son
        of Kish was taken:  but when they sought him, he could
        not be found.
010:022 Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man
        to come here?  Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself
        among the baggage.
010:023 They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among
        the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
        shoulders and upward.
010:024 Samuel said to all the people, "You see him whom Yahweh
        has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?"
        All the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.
010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom,
        and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh.
        Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
010:026 Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him
        the army, whose hearts God had touched.
010:027 But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us?
        They despised him, and brought him no present.
        But he held his peace.
011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead:
        and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant
        with us, and we will serve you.
011:002 Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I
        make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out;
        and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.
011:003 The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we
        may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then,
        if there be none to save us, we will come out to you.
011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these
        words in the ears of the people:  and all the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept.
011:005 Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field;
        and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep?
        They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
011:006 The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words,
        and his anger was kindled greatly.
011:007 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent
        them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand
        of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn't come forth after
        Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.
        The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out
        as one man.
011:008 He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were
        three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
011:009 They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell
        the men of Jabesh Gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot,
        you shall have deliverance.  The messengers came and told
        the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you,
        and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.
011:011 It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in
        three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the
        morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day:
        and it happened, that those who remained were scattered,
        so that no two of them were left together.
011:012 The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign
        over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
011:013 Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day;
        for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.
011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
        and renew the kingdom there.
011:015 All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
        before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices
        of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all
        the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
012:001 Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice
        in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.
012:002 Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old
        and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you:
        and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.
012:003 Here I am:  witness against me before Yahweh, and before
        his anointed:  whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I
        taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed?
        or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes
        therewith? and I will restore it you.
012:004 They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
        neither have you taken anything of any man's hand.
012:005 He said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed
        is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.
        They said, He is witness.
012:006 Samuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron,
        and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you
        before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh,
        which he did to you and to your fathers.
012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh,
        then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your
        fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
012:009 But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand
        of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand
        of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab;
        and they fought against them.
012:010 They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have
        forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth:
        but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we
        will serve you.
012:011 Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,
        and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side;
        and you lived in safety.
012:012 When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came
        against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us;
        when Yahweh your God was your king.
012:013 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you
        have asked for:  and behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.
012:014 If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice,
        and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you
        and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh
        your God, [well]:
012:015 but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel
        against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh
        be against you, as it was against your fathers.
012:016 Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh
        will do before your eyes.
012:017 Isn't it wheat harvest today?  I will call to Yahweh,
        that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see
        that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight
        of Yahweh, in asking you a king.
012:018 So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain
        that day:  and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.
012:019 All the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Yahweh
        your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins
        [this] evil, to ask us a king.
012:020 Samuel said to the people, "Don't be afraid; you have indeed
        done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following Yahweh,
        but serve Yahweh with all your heart:
012:021 and don't turn aside; for [then would you go] after vain things
        which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
012:022 For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake,
        because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself.
012:023 Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against
        Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you:  but I will instruct you
        in the good and the right way.
012:024 Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart;
        for consider how great things he has done for you.
012:025 But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed,
        both you and your king."
013:001 Saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign;
        and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, of which two
        thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel,
        and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin:
        and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
013:003 Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba:
        and the Philistines heard of it.  Saul blew the trumpet
        throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
013:004 All Israel heard say that Saul had struck the garrison of
        the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination
        with the Philistines.  The people were gathered together
        after Saul to Gilgal.
013:005 The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel,
        thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
        and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude:
        and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.
013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait
        (for the people were distressed), then the people did
        hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks,
        and in coverts, and in pits.
013:007 Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land
        of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal,
        and all the people followed him trembling.
013:008 He stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
        [had appointed]: but Samuel didn't come to Gilgal;
        and the people were scattered from him.
013:009 Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the
        peace offerings.  He offered the burnt offering.
013:010 It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering
        the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out
        to meet him, that he might greet him.
013:011 Samuel said, What have you done?  Saul said, Because I saw
        that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't
        come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
        assembled themselves together at Michmash;
013:012 therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me
        to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of Yahweh:  I forced
        myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.
013:013 Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept
        the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you:
        for now would Yahweh have established your kingdom
        on Israel forever.
013:014 But now your kingdom shall not continue:  Yahweh has sought
        him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him
        to be prince over his people, because you have not kept
        that which Yahweh commanded you.
013:015 Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.
        Saul numbered the people who were present with him,
        about six hundred men.
013:016 Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present
        with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin:  but the Philistines
        encamped in Michmash.
013:017 The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
        three companies:  one company turned to the way that leads
        to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
013:018 and another company turned the way to Beth Horon;
        and another company turned the way of the border that looks
        down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel;
        for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
        swords or spears:
013:020 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
        every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;
013:021 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares,
        and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
        sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who
        were with Saul and Jonathan:  but with Saul and with Jonathan
        his son was there found.
013:023 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
014:001 Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said
        to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go
        over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side.
        But he didn't tell his father.
014:002 Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate
        tree which is in Migron:  and the people who were with him
        were about six hundred men;
014:003 and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas,
        the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.
        The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.
014:004 Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to
        the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side,
        and a rocky crag on the other side:  and the name of the one
        was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
014:005 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash,
        and the other on the south in front of Geba.
014:006 Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come,
        and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised:
        it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no
        restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.
014:007 His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart:
        turn you, behold, I am with you according to your heart.
014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men,
        and we will disclose ourselves to them.
014:009 If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we
        will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
014:010 But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up;
        for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand:  and this shall
        be the sign to us.
014:011 Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines:
        and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
        out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
014:012 The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer,
        and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.
        Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me;
        for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
014:013 Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his
        armor bearer after him:  and they fell before Jonathan;
        and his armor bearer killed them after him.
014:014 That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made,
        was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length
        in an acre of land.
014:015 There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all
        the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled;
        and the earth quaked:  so there was an exceeding great trembling.
014:016 The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold,
        the multitude melted away, and they went [here] and there.
014:017 Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now,
        and see who is gone from us.  When they had numbered, behold,
        Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.
014:018 Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God.  For the ark
        of God was [there] at that time with the children of Israel.
014:019 It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult
        that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased:
        and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.
014:020 Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together,
        and came to the battle:  and behold, every man's sword was
        against his fellow, [and there was] a very great confusion.
014:021 Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before,
        and who went up with them into the camp, [from the country]
        round about, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites
        who were with Saul and Jonathan.
014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill
        country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled,
        even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
014:023 So Yahweh saved Israel that day:  and the battle passed over
        by Beth Aven.
014:024 The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had
        adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any
        food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies.
        So none of the people tasted food.
014:025 All the people came into the forest; and there was honey
        on the ground.
014:026 When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped:
        but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people
        feared the oath.
014:027 But Jonathan didn't hear when his father charged the people
        with the oath:  therefore he put forth the end of the rod
        who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put
        his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly
        charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
        who eats food this day.  The people were faint.
014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land.
        Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I
        tasted a little of this honey.
014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today
        of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has
        there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.
014:031 They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon.
        The people were very faint;
014:032 and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
        and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people
        ate them with the blood.
014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin
        against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood.
        He said, you have dealt treacherously:  roll a great stone
        to me this day.
014:034 Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them,
        Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
        and kill them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh
        in eating with the blood.  All the people brought every man
        his ox with him that night, and killed them there.
014:035 Saul built an altar to Yahweh:  the same was the first altar
        that he built to Yahweh.
014:036 Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
        and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not
        leave a man of them.  They said, Do whatever seems good to you.
        Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.
014:037 Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?
        will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?  But he didn't
        answer him that day.
014:038 Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people;
        and know and see in which this sin has been this day.
014:039 For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan
        my son, he shall surely die.  But there was not a man among
        all the people who answered him.
014:040 Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side,
        and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.
        The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.
014:041 Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right.
        Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.
014:042 Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son.
        Jonathan was taken.
014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done.
        Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little
        honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold,
        I must die.
014:044 Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall
        surely die, Jonathan.
014:045 The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has
        worked this great salvation in Israel?  Far from it:
        as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head
        fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day.
        So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn't die.
014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines;
        and the Philistines went to their own place.
014:047 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought
        against all his enemies on every side, against Moab,
        and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom,
        and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines:
        and wherever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.
014:048 He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered
        Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.
014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua;
        and the names of his two daughters were these:  the name
        of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
014:050 and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.
        The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son
        of Ner, Saul's uncle.
014:051 Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
        the son of Abiel.
014:052 There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
        and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man,
        he took him to him.
015:001 Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king
        over his people, over Israel:  now therefore listen you
        to the voice of the words of Yahweh.
015:002 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek
        did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way,
        when he came up out of Egypt.
015:003 Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
        and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman,
        infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.
015:004 Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim,
        two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
015:005 Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
015:006 Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among
        the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you shown kindness
        to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.
        So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
015:007 Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur,
        that is before Egypt.
015:008 He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
        destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
        and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all
        that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them:  but everything
        that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
015:010 Then came the word of Yahweh to Samuel, saying,
015:011 It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned
        back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.
        Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.
015:012 Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it
        was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold,
        he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on,
        and went down to Gilgal.
015:013 Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed are you
        by Yahweh:  I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.
015:014 Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears,
        and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
015:015 Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:
        for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,
        to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we
        have utterly destroyed.
015:016 Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh
        has said to me this night.  He said to him, Say on.
015:017 Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight,
        weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel?  Yahweh anointed
        you king over Israel;
015:018 and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly
        destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
        until they are consumed.'
015:019 Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil,
        and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"
015:020 Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh,
        and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag
        the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
        of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.
015:022 Samuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings
        and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?  Behold, to obey
        is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
        as idolatry and teraphim.  Because you have rejected the word
        of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.
015:024 Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed
        the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared
        the people, and obeyed their voice.
015:025 Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me,
        that I may worship Yahweh.
015:026 Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you
        have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected
        you from being king over Israel.
015:027 As Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt
        of his robe, and it tore.
015:028 Samuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel
        from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours
        who is better than you.
015:029 Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent;
        for he is not a man, that he should repent.
015:030 Then he said, I have sinned:  yet honor me now, Please, before the
        elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me,
        that I may worship Yahweh your God.
015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.
015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king
        of the Amalekites.  Agag came to him cheerfully.
        Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
015:033 Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall
        your mother be childless among women.  Samuel hewed Agag
        in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.
015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house
        to Gibeah of Saul.
015:035 Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death;
        for Samuel mourned for Saul:  and Yahweh grieved that he had
        made Saul king over Israel.
016:001 Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I
        have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill your horn
        with oil, and go:  I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite;
        for I have provided me a king among his sons.
016:002 Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
        Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come
        to sacrifice to Yahweh.
016:003 Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do:
        and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.
016:004 Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem.
        The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said,
        Come you peaceably?
016:005 He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh:
        sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.
        He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
016:006 It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab,
        and said, Surely Yahweh's anointed is before him.
016:007 But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don't look on his face, or on
        the height of his stature; because I have rejected him:
        for [Yahweh sees] not as man sees; for man looks at the
        outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."
016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
        He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.
016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  He said, Neither has
        Yahweh chosen this.
016:010 Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
        Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.
016:011 Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children?
        He said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is
        keeping the sheep.  Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him;
        for we will not sit down until he come here.
016:012 He sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy,
        and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on.
        Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
        of his brothers:  and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily
        on David from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up,
        and went to Ramah.
016:014 Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
        from Yahweh troubled him.
016:015 Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from
        God troubles you.
016:016 Let our lord now command your servants who are before you,
        to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp:
        and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you,
        that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.
016:017 Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well,
        and bring him to me.
016:018 Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen
        a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing,
        and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent
        in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.
016:019 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me
        David your son, who is with the sheep.
016:020 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine,
        and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
016:021 David came to Saul, and stood before him:  and he loved him greatly;
        and he became his armor bearer.
016:022 Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me;
        for he has found favor in my sight.
016:023 It happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul,
        that David took the harp, and played with his hand:
        so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit
        departed from him.
017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle;
        and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah,
        and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
017:002 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,
        and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
        against the Philistines.
017:003 The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side,
        and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side:
        and there was a valley between them.
017:004 There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
        named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
017:005 He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a
        coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand
        shekels of brass.
017:006 He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass
        between his shoulders.
017:007 The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam;
        and his spear's head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron:
        and his shield bearer went before him.
017:008 He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them,
        Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am I not
        a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you,
        and let him come down to me.
017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we
        be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
        then shall you be our servants, and serve us.
017:010 The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
        give me a man, that we may fight together.
017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
        they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah,
        whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons:  and the man was
        an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.
017:013 The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle:
        and the names of his three sons who went to the battle
        were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab,
        and the third Shammah.
017:014 David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
017:015 Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's
        sheep at Bethlehem.
017:016 The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
        himself forty days.
017:017 Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers
        an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves,
        and carry [them] quickly to the camp to your brothers;
017:018 and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand,
        and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.
017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley
        of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
017:020 David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
        a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
        and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was
        going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
017:021 Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array,
        army against army.
017:022 David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage,
        and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.
017:023 As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
        the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks
        of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words:
        and David heard them.
017:024 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
        and were sore afraid.
017:025 The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come
        up? surely to defy Israel is he come up:  and it shall be,
        that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him
        with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make
        his father's house free in Israel.
017:026 David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall
        be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away
        the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine,
        that he should defy the armies of the living God?
017:027 The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall
        it be done to the man who kills him.
017:028 Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's
        anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why are you come down?
        and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?
        I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart;
        for you have come down that you might see the battle.
017:029 David said, What have I now done?  Is there not a cause?
017:030 He turned away from him toward another, and spoke after
        the same manner:  and the people answered him again after
        the former manner.
017:031 When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed
        them before Saul; and he sent for him.
017:032 David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him;
        your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
017:033 Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this
        Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth,
        and he a man of war from his youth.
017:034 David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father's sheep;
        and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out
        of the flock,
017:035 I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out
        of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him
        by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.
017:036 Your servant struck both the lion and the bear:
        and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them,
        seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.
017:037 David said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion,
        and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand
        of this Philistine.  Saul said to David, Go, and Yahweh shall
        be with you.
017:038 Saul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass
        on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
017:039 David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go;
        for he had not proved it.  David said to Saul, I can't go with these;
        for I have not proved them.  David put them off him.
017:040 He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
        out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which
        he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand:
        and he drew near to the Philistine.
017:041 The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man
        who bore the shield went before him.
017:042 When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him;
        for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.
017:043 The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me
        with sticks?  The Philistine cursed David by his gods.
017:044 The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
        your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals
        of the field.
017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword,
        and with a spear, and with a javelin:  but I come to you in
        the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel,
        whom you have defied.
017:046 This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will
        strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give
        the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day
        to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth;
        that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
017:047 and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't
        save with sword and spear:  for the battle is Yahweh's,
        and he will give you into our hand.
017:048 It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near
        to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army
        to meet the Philistine.
017:049 David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone,
        and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead;
        and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face
        to the earth.
017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and
        with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him;
        but there was no sword in the hand of David.
017:051 Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword,
        and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him,
        and cut off his head therewith.  When the Philistines saw
        that their champion was dead, they fled.
017:052 The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued
        the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron.
        The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,
        even to Gath, and to Ekron.
017:053 The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines,
        and they plundered their camp.
017:054 David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem;
        but he put his armor in his tent.
017:055 When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner,
        the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth?
        Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell.
017:056 The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"
017:057 As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
        took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
        the Philistine in his hand.
017:058 Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man?
        David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
018:001 It happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul,
        that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
        and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
018:002 Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
        to his father's house.
018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
        as his own soul.
018:004 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him,
        and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword,
        and to his bow, and to his sash.
018:005 David went out wherever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely:
        and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight
        of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
018:006 It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter
        of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities
        of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
        with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.
018:007 The women sang one to another as they played, and said,
        Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands.
018:008 Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him;
        and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands,
        and to me they have ascribed but thousands:  and what can
        he have more but the kingdom?
018:009 Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
018:010 It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came
        mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house:
        and David played with his hand, as he did day by day.
        Saul had his spear in his hand;
018:011 and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David
        even to the wall.  David avoided out of his presence twice.
018:012 Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him,
        and was departed from Saul.
018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
        over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
018:014 David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh
        was with him.
018:015 When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood
        in awe of him.
018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came
        in before them.
018:017 Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give
        you as wife:  only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh's battles.
        For Saul said, Don't let my hand be on him, but let the hand
        of the Philistines be on him.
018:018 David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my
        father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law
        to the king?
018:019 But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter,
        should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel
        the Meholathite as wife.
018:020 Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David:  and they told Saul,
        and the thing pleased him.
018:021 Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him,
        and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
        Therefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son-in-law
        a second time.
018:022 Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly,
        and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his
        servants love you:  now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
018:023 Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David.
        David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be the king's
        son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
018:024 The servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
018:025 Saul said, Thus shall you tell David, The king desires
        no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines,
        to be avenged of the king's enemies.  Now Saul thought to make
        David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
018:026 When his servants told David these words, it pleased David
        well to be the king's son-in-law. The days were not expired;
018:027 and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed
        of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought
        their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king,
        that he might be the king's son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal
        his daughter as wife.
018:028 Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David;
        and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
018:029 Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was
        David's enemy continually.
018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth:
        and it happened, as often as they went forth, that David
        behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul;
        so that his name was much set by.
019:001 Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
        that they should kill David.  But Jonathan, Saul's son,
        delighted much in David.
019:002 Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you:
        now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning,
        and live in a secret place, and hide yourself:
019:003 and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
        where you are, and I will commune with my father of you;
        and if I see anything, I will tell you.
019:004 Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him,
        Don't let the king sin against his servant, against David;
        because he has not sinned against you, and because his works
        have been very good toward you:
019:005 for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine,
        and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel:  you saw it,
        and did rejoice; why then will you sin against innocent blood,
        to kill David without a cause?
019:006 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan:  and Saul swore,
        As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.
019:007 Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.
        Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence,
        as before.
019:008 There was war again:  and David went out, and fought with
        the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter;
        and they fled before him.
019:009 An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house
        with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.
019:010 Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear;
        but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he struck
        the spear into the wall:  and David fled, and escaped that night.
019:011 Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him,
        and to kill him in the morning:  and Michal, David's wife,
        told him, saying, If you don't save your life tonight,
        tomorrow you will be slain.
019:012 So Michal let David down through the window:  and he went,
        and fled, and escaped.
019:013 Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put
        a pillow of goats' [hair] at the head of it, and covered it
        with the clothes.
019:014 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
019:015 Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up
        to me in the bed, that I may kill him.
019:016 When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed,
        with the pillow of goats' [hair] at the head of it.
019:017 Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my
        enemy go, so that he is escaped?  Michal answered Saul, He said
        to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?
019:018 Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
        and told him all that Saul had done to him.  He and Samuel
        went and lived in Naioth.
019:019 It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
019:020 Saul sent messengers to take David:  and when they saw the company
        of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head
        over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul,
        and they also prophesied.
019:021 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
        also prophesied.  Saul sent messengers again the third time,
        and they also prophesied.
019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well
        that is in Secu:  and he asked and said, Where are Samuel
        and David?  One said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
019:023 He went there to Naioth in Ramah:  and the Spirit of God came
        on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came
        to Naioth in Ramah.
019:024 He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied
        before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
        Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
020:001 David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said
        before Jonathan, "What have I done?  What is my iniquity?"
        and "What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"
020:002 He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die:  behold, my father
        does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it
        to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me?
        It is not so."
020:003 David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows
        well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says,
        'Don't let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:'
        but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is
        but a step between me and death."
020:004 Then said Jonathan to David, "Whatever your soul desires,
        I will even do it for you."
020:005 David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,
        and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go,
        that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.
020:006 If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly
        asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city;
        for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'
020:007 If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace:
        but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.
020:008 Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have
        brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you:
        but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why
        should you bring me to your father?"
020:009 Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all
        know that evil were determined by my father to come on you,
        then wouldn't I tell you that?"
020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance
        your father answer you roughly?"
020:011 Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field."
        They both went out into the field.
020:012 Jonathan said to David, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]:
        when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow,
        [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David,
        shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?
020:013 Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my
        father to do you evil, if I don't disclose it to you, and send
        you away, that you may go in peace:  and Yahweh be with you,
        as he has been with my father.
020:014 You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness
        of Yahweh, that I not die;
020:015 but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever;
        no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone
        from the surface of the earth."
020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying],
        Yahweh will require it at the hand of David's enemies.
020:017 Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had
        to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
020:018 Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon:
        and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
020:019 When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly,
        and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the
        business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
020:020 I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot
        at a mark.
020:021 Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows.
        If I tell the boy, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you;
        take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt,
        as Yahweh lives.
020:022 But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you;
        go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.
020:023 As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold,
        Yahweh is between you and me forever.
020:024 So David hid himself in the field:  and when the new moon was come,
        the king sat him down to eat food.
020:025 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat
        by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side:
        but David's place was empty.
020:026 Nevertheless Saul didn't say anything that day:
        for he thought, Something has happened to him.  He is not clean.
        Surely he is not clean.
020:027 It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was]
        the second [day], that David's place was empty:  and Saul said
        to Jonathan his son, Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to meat,
        neither yesterday, nor today?
020:028 Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
        to go to Bethlehem:
020:029 and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice
        in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to
        be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes,
        let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers.
        Therefore he is not come to the king's table.
020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
        to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don't I know
        that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame,
        and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall
        not be established, nor your kingdom.  Therefore now send
        and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.
020:032 Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should
        he be put to death?  What has he done?"
020:033 Saul cast his spear at him to strike him.  By this Jonathan
        knew that his father was determined to put David to death.
020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food
        the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David,
        because his father had done him shame.
020:035 It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field
        at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.
020:036 He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.
        As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
020:037 When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which
        Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said,
        Isn't the arrow beyond you?
020:038 Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast!  Hurry!  Don't delay!
        Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
020:039 But the boy didn't know anything:  only Jonathan and David
        knew the matter.
020:040 Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go,
        carry them to the city.
020:041 As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place]
        toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground,
        and bowed himself three times:  and they kissed one another,
        and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
020:042 Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn
        both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be
        between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.
        He arose and departed:  and Jonathan went into the city.
021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest:
        and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him,
        Why are you alone, and no man with you?
021:002 David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me
        a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the
        business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you:
        and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.
021:003 Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves
        of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.
021:004 The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
        under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young
        men have kept themselves from women.
021:005 David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth
        women have been kept from us about these three days;
        when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy,
        though it was but a common journey; how much more then today
        shall their vessels be holy?
021:006 So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread
        there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh,
        to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
        detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite,
        the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
021:008 David said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear
        or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons
        with me, because the king's business required haste.
021:009 The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
        whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here
        wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod:  if you will take that,
        take it; for there is no other except that here.
        David said, There is none like that; give it me.
021:010 David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
        to Achish the king of Gath.
021:011 The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David
        the king of the land?  Didn't they sing one to another
        about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands,
        David his ten thousands?'"
021:012 David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid
        of Achish the king of Gath.
021:013 He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad
        in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
        and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
021:014 Then said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad;
        why then have you brought him to me?
021:015 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play
        the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
022:001 David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam:
        and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it,
        they went down there to him.
022:002 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt,
        and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him;
        and he became captain over them:  and there were with him
        about four hundred men.
022:003 David went there to Mizpeh of Moab:  and he said to the king
        of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth,
        [and be] with you, until I know what God will do for me.
022:004 He brought them before the king of Moab:  and they lived
        with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
022:005 The prophet Gad said to David, Don't stay in the stronghold;
        depart, and get you into the land of Judah.  Then David departed,
        and came into the forest of Hereth.
022:006 Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him:
        now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree
        in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants
        were standing about him.
022:007 Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now,
        you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give everyone of you
        fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands
        and captains of hundreds,
022:008 that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
        who discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son
        of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me,
        or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant
        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants
        of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob,
        to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
022:010 He inquired of Yahweh for him, and gave him food, and gave
        him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub,
        and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob:
        and they came all of them to the king.
022:012 Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub.  He answered,
        Here I am, my lord.
022:013 Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me,
        you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread,
        and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should
        rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, Who among all your
        servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law,
        and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?
022:015 Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me:
        don't let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to
        all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing
        of all this, less or more.
022:016 The king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all
        your father's house.
022:017 The king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill
        the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David,
        and because they knew that he fled, and didn't disclose it to me.
        But the servants of the king wouldn't put forth their hand
        to fall on the priests of Yahweh.
022:018 The king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests.
        Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests,
        and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore
        a linen ephod.
022:019 Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of
        the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies,
        and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
022:020 One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,
        escaped, and fled after David.
022:021 Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh's priests.
022:022 David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite
        was there, that he would surely tell Saul:  I have occasioned
        [the death] of all the persons of your father's house.
022:023 Abide you with me, don't be afraid; for he who seeks my life
        seeks your life:  for with me you shall be in safeguard.
023:001 They told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting
        against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.
023:002 Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike
        these Philistines?  Yahweh said to David, Go, and strike
        the Philistines, and save Keilah.
023:003 David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah:
        how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies
        of the Philistines?
023:004 Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again.  Yahweh answered him,
        and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver
        the Philistines into your hand.
023:005 David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines,
        and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a
        great slaughter.  So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
023:006 It happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David
        to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
023:007 It was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.  Saul said,
        God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in,
        by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
023:008 Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah,
        to besiege David and his men.
023:009 David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him;
        and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.
023:010 Then said David, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has
        surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy
        the city for my sake.
023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?
        will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?
        Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.
        Yahweh said, He will come down.
023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me
        and my men into the hand of Saul?  Yahweh said, They will
        deliver you up.
023:013 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and
        departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go.
        It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
        and he gave up going there.
023:014 David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds,
        and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph.
        Saul sought him every day, but God didn't deliver him
        into his hand.
023:015 David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life:
        and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
023:016 Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the wood,
        and strengthened his hand in God.
023:017 He said to him, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father
        shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I
        shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.
023:018 They two made a covenant before Yahweh:  and David abode
        in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David
        hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood,
        in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire
        of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver
        him up into the king's hand.
023:021 Saul said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had
        compassion on me.
023:022 Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place
        where his haunt is, [and] who has seen him there; for it
        is told me that he deals very subtly.
023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
        where he hides himself, and come you again to me of a certainty,
        and I will go with you:  and it shall happen, if he be in the land,
        that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
023:024 They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul:  but David and his men
        were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south
        of the desert.
023:025 Saul and his men went to seek him.  When David was told,
        he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.
        When Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the
        wilderness of Maon.
023:026 Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men
        on that side of the mountain:  and David made haste to get
        away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
        and his men round about to take them.
023:027 But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come;
        for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.
023:028 So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
        against the Philistines:  therefore they called that
        place Sela Hammahlekoth.
023:029 David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds
        of En Gedi.
024:001 It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines,
        that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness
        of En Gedi.
024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
        and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.
024:003 He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave;
        and Saul went in to relieve himself.  Now David and his men
        were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
024:004 The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh
        said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand,
        and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.
        Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.
024:005 It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him,
        because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
024:006 He said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing
        to my lord, Yahweh's anointed, to put forth my hand against him,
        seeing he is Yahweh's anointed.
024:007 So David checked his men with these words, and didn't allow
        them to rise against Saul.  Saul rose up out of the cave,
        and went on his way.
024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave,
        and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king.  When Saul
        looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth,
        and did obeisance.
024:009 David said to Saul, Why listen you to men's words, saying,
        Behold, David seeks your hurt?
024:010 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh
        had delivered you today into my hand in the cave:
        and some bade me kill you; but [my eye] spared you;
        and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord;
        for he is Yahweh's anointed.
024:011 Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe
        in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe,
        and didn't kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil
        nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you,
        though you hunt after my life to take it.
024:012 Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you;
        but my hand shall not be on you.
024:013 As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes
        forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.
024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you
        pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
024:015 Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you,
        and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.
024:016 It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
        these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice,
        my son David?  Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
024:017 He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have
        rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.
024:018 You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me,
        because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand,
        you didn't kill me.
024:019 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed?
        Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you
        have done to me this day.
024:020 Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that
        the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
024:021 Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut
        off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name
        out of my father's house.
024:022 David swore to Saul.  Saul went home; but David and his men
        got them up to the stronghold.
025:001 Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together,
        and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.
        David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
025:002 There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
        and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
        and a thousand goats:  and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail;
        and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face:
        but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was
        of the house of Caleb.
025:004 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
025:005 David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men,
        Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
025:006 and thus shall you tell him who lives [in prosperity],
        Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be
        to all that you have.
025:007 Now I have heard that you have shearers:  your shepherds have
        now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there
        anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
025:008 Ask your young men, and they will tell you:  therefore let
        the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day.
        Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants,
        and to your son David.
025:009 When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according
        to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
025:010 Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
        and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants who break
        away from their masters these days.
025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I
        have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don't
        know where they come from?
025:012 So David's young men turned on their way, and went back,
        and came and told him according to all these words.
025:013 David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword.
        They girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on
        his sword:  and there went up after David about four hundred men;
        and two hundred abode by the baggage.
025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife,
        saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness
        to Greet our master; and he railed at them.
025:015 But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt,
        neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them,
        when we were in the fields:
025:016 they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we
        were with them keeping the sheep.
025:017 Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil
        is determined against our master, and against all his house:
        for he is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to him.
025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves,
        and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
        measures of parched grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins,
        and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
025:019 She said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.
        But she didn't tell her husband, Nabal.
025:020 It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert
        of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down
        toward her; and she met them.
025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
        fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all
        that pertained to him:  and he has returned me evil for good.
025:022 God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave
        of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much
        as one who urinates on a wall.{or, male.}
025:023 When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey,
        and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself
        to the ground.
025:024 She fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be
        the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears.
        Hear the words of your handmaid.
025:025 Please don't let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal;
        for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly
        is with him:  but I your handmaid didn't see the young men
        of my lord, whom you did send.
025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives,
        seeing Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness,
        and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore
        let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord,
        be as Nabal.
025:027 Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord,
        let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
025:028 Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid:  for Yahweh
        will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord
        fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found
        in you all your days.
025:029 Though men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul,
        yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life
        with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies,
        them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.
025:030 It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my lord
        according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you,
        and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,
025:031 that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart
        to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause,
        or that my lord has avenged himself.  When Yahweh shall
        have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.
025:032 David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        who sent you this day to meet me:
025:033 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have
        kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging
        myself with my own hand.
025:034 For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has
        withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried
        and come to meet me, surely there wouldn't have been left
        to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates
        on a wall.{or, male.}
025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him:
        and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have
        listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.
025:036 Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house,
        like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him,
        for he was very drunken:  therefore she told him nothing,
        less or more, until the morning light.
025:037 It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal,
        that his wife told him these things, and his heart died
        within him, and he became as a stone.
025:038 It happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal,
        so that he died.
025:039 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh,
        who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand
        of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil:
        and the evil-doing of Nabal has Yahweh returned on his own head.
        David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to
        him as wife.
025:040 When the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
        they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take
        you to him as wife.
025:041 She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth,
        and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet
        of the servants of my lord.
025:042 Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies
        of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers
        of David, and became his wife.
025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both
        of them his wives.
025:044 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife,
        to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
026:001 The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide
        himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
        having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
        David in the wilderness of Ziph.
026:003 Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert,
        by the way.  But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw
        that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
        come of a certainty.
026:005 David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped;
        and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,
        the captain of his army:  and Saul lay within the place
        of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.
026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite,
        and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab,
        saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?
        Abishai said, I will go down with you.
026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night:
        and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons,
        with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner
        and the people lay round about him.
026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy
        into your hand this day:  now therefore please let me strike
        him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will
        not strike him the second time.
026:009 David said to Abishai, Don't destroy him; for who can put forth
        his hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be guiltless?
026:010 David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day
        shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
026:011 Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against
        Yahweh's anointed:  but now please take the spear that is at
        his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.
026:012 So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head;
        and they got them away:  and no man saw it, nor knew it,
        neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep
        sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.
026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
        of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
026:014 and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
        saying, Don't you answer, Abner?  Then Abner answered,
        Who are you who cries to the king?
026:015 David said to Abner, Aren't you a [valiant] man? and who is like
        you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord,
        the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy
        the king your lord.
026:016 This thing isn't good that you have done.  As Yahweh lives,
        you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over
        your lord, Yahweh's anointed.  Now see where the king's spear is,
        and the jar of water that was at his head.
026:017 Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice,
        my son David?  David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
026:018 He said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? for what
        have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
026:019 Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words
        of his servant.  If it be Yahweh that has stirred you
        up against me, let him accept an offering:  but if it
        be the children of men, cursed be they before Yahweh:
        for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling
        to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.
026:020 Now therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away
        from the presence of Yahweh:  for the king of Israel is
        come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge
        in the mountains.
026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned:  return, my son David;
        for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious
        in your eyes this day:  behold, I have played the fool,
        and have erred exceedingly.
026:022 David answered, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of
        the young men come over and get it.
026:023 Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and
        his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today,
        and I wouldn't put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed.
026:024 Behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes,
        so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let
        him deliver me out of all oppression.
026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David:
        you shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail.
        So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
027:001 David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand
        of Saul:  there is nothing better for me than that I should
        escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair
        of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel:
        so shall I escape out of his hand.
027:002 David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men
        who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
027:003 David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
        with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam
        the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
027:004 It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath:  and he sought
        no more again for him.
027:005 David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes,
        let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country,
        that I may dwell there:  for why should your servant dwell
        in the royal city with you?
027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day:  why Ziklag pertains
        to the kings of Judah to this day.
027:007 The number of the days that David lived in the country
        of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
027:008 David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites,
        and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those [nations] were
        the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur,
        even to the land of Egypt.
027:009 David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive,
        and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys,
        and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned,
        and came to Achish.
027:010 Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today?
        David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South
        of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
027:011 David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath,
        saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David,
        and so has been his manner all the while he has lived
        in the country of the Philistines.
027:012 Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel
        utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever.
028:001 It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered
        their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.
        Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go
        out with me in the army, you and your men.
028:002 David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant
        will do.  Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you
        keeper of my head for ever.
028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him,
        and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.  Saul had
        put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        out of the land.
028:004 The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
        encamped in Shunem:  and Saul gathered all Israel together,
        and they encamped in Gilboa.
028:005 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid,
        and his heart trembled greatly.
028:006 When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn't answer him,
        neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
028:007 Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who has
        a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.
        His servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has
        a familiar spirit at Endor.
028:008 Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went,
        he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night:
        and he said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit,
        and bring me up whoever I shall name to you.
028:009 The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done,
        how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        out of the land:  why then lay you a snare for my life,
        to cause me to die?
028:010 Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives,
        there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.
028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you?
        He said, Bring me up Samuel.
028:012 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice;
        and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived
        me? for you are Saul.
028:013 The king said to her, Don't be afraid:  for what do you see?
        The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
028:014 He said to her, What form is he of?  She said, An old man
        comes up; and he is covered with a robe.  Saul perceived
        that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground,
        and did obeisance.
028:015 Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up?
        Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
        make war against me, and God is departed from me,
        and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
        therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me
        what I shall do.
028:016 Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed
        from you, and is become your adversary?
028:017 Yahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me:  and Yahweh has torn
        the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor,
        even to David.
028:018 Because you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn't execute
        his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this
        thing to you this day.
028:019 Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand
        of the Philistines; and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me:
        Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand
        of the Philistines.
028:020 Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth,
        and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel:
        and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread
        all the day, nor all the night.
028:021 The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
        and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice,
        and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your
        words which you spoke to me.
028:022 Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid,
        and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat,
        that you may have strength, when you go on your way.
028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat.  But his servants,
        together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened
        to their voice.  So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.
028:024 The woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried,
        and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did
        bake unleavened bread of it:
028:025 and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants;
        and they ate.  Then they rose up, and went away that night.
029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
        and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.
029:002 The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands;
        and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do]
        these Hebrews [here]?  Achish said to the princes of
        the Philistines, Isn't this David, the servant of Saul the king
        of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather]
        these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell
        away [to me] to this day?
029:004 But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him;
        and the princes of the Philistines said to him,
        Make the man return, that he may go back to his place
        where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us
        to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us:
        for with what should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his
        lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?
029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
        saying, Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?
029:006 Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives,
        you have been upright, and your going out and your coming
        in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found
        evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day:
        nevertheless the lords don't favor you.
029:007 Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease
        the lords of the Philistines.
029:008 David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you
        found in your servant so long as I have been before you
        to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies
        of my lord the king?
029:009 Achish answered David, I know that you are good in my sight,
        as an angel of God:  notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines
        have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
029:010 Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants
        of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up
        early in the morning, and have light, depart.
029:011 So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in
        the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines.
        The Philistines went up to Jezreel.
030:001 It happened, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on
        the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South,
        and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
030:002 and had taken captive the women [and all] who were therein,
        both small and great:  they didn't kill any, but carried them off,
        and went their way.
030:003 When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned
        with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters,
        were taken captive.
030:004 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their
        voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
030:005 David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
        and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
030:006 David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him,
        because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man
        for his sons and for his daughters:  but David strengthened
        himself in Yahweh his God.
030:007 David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Please bring
        me here the ephod.  Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.
030:008 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop,
        shall I overtake them?  He answered him, Pursue; for you shall
        surely overtake [them], and shall without fail recover [all].
030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,
        and came to the brook Besor, where those who were
        left behind stayed.
030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred
        stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over
        the brook Besor.
030:011 They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David,
        and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.
030:012 They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins:
        and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him;
        for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days
        and three nights.
030:013 David said to him, To whom belong you? and whence are you?
        He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;
        and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
030:014 We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on
        that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb;
        and we burned Ziklag with fire.
030:015 David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop?
        He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me,
        nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring
        you down to this troop.
030:016 When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad
        over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing,
        because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of
        the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
030:017 David struck them from the twilight even to the evening
        of the next day:  and there not a man of them escaped,
        except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.
030:018 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David
        rescued his two wives.
030:019 There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
        neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything
        that they had taken to them:  David brought back all.
030:020 David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove
        before those [other] livestock, and said, This is David's spoil.
030:021 David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they
        could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide
        at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David,
        and to meet the people who were with him:  and when David
        came near to the people, he greeted them.
030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who
        went with David, and said, Because they didn't go with us,
        we will not give them anything of the spoil that we
        have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children,
        that he may lead them away, and depart.
030:023 Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers,
        with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us,
        and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
030:024 Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is
        who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries
        by the baggage:  they shall share alike.
030:025 It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
        and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
030:026 When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders
        of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present
        for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:
030:027 To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth
        of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,
030:028 and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth,
        and to those who were in Eshtemoa,
030:029 and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities
        of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities
        of the Kenites,
030:030 and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan,
        and to those who were in Athach,
030:031 and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where
        David himself and his men used to stay.
031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel:  and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        on Mount Gilboa.
031:002 The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons;
        and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua,
        the sons of Saul.
031:003 The battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him;
        and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
031:004 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust
        me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust
        me through, and abuse me.  But his armor bearer would not;
        for he was sore afraid.  Therefore Saul took his sword,
        and fell on it.
031:005 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell
        on his sword, and died with him.
031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer,
        and all his men, that same day together.
031:007 When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley,
        and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men
        of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
        and lived in them.
031:008 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip
        the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen
        on Mount Gilboa.
031:009 They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent
        into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the news
        to the house of their idols, and to the people.
031:010 They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they
        fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
031:011 When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him
        that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
031:012 all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body
        of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan;
        and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
031:013 They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree
        in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
Book 10 2 Samuel
001:001 It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned
        from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode
        two days in Ziklag;
001:002 it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of
        the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head:
        and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth,
        and did obeisance.
001:003 David said to him, From whence come you?  He said to him,
        Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
001:004 David said to him, How went the matter?  Please tell me.
        He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many
        of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan
        his son are dead also.
001:005 David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul
        and Jonathan his son are dead?
001:006 The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on
        Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold,
        the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
001:007 When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me.
        I answered, Here am I.
001:008 He said to me, Who are you?  I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
001:009 He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me;
        for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet
        whole in me.
001:010 So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was
        sure that he could not live after that he was fallen:
        and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet
        that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them;
        and likewise all the men who were with him:
001:012 and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh,
        and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen
        by the sword.
001:013 David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you?
        He answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.
001:014 David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your
        hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?
001:015 David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
        and fall on him.  He struck him, so that he died.
001:016 David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has
        testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.
001:017 David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son
001:018 (and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of]
        the bow:  behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
001:019 Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!
        How the mighty have fallen!
001:020 Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't publish it in the streets
        of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
        lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
001:021 You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you,
        neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of
        the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul was not
        anointed with oil.
001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
        Jonathan's bow didn't turn back.  Saul's sword didn't return empty.
001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
        In their death, they were not divided.  They were swifter
        than eagles.  They were stronger than lions.
001:024 You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
        Jonathan is slain on your high places.
001:026 I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.  You have
        been very pleasant to me.  Your love to me was wonderful,
        passing the love of women.
001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
002:001 It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying,
        Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?  Yahweh said
        to him, Go up.  David said, Where shall I go up?
        He said, To Hebron.
002:002 So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam
        the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
002:003 His men who were with him did David bring up, every man
        with his household:  and they lived in the cities of Hebron.
002:004 The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah.  They told David, saying, The men
        of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.
002:005 David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said
        to them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have shown this
        kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
002:006 Now Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you:
        and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have
        done this thing.
002:007 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant;
        for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah
        have anointed me king over them.
002:008 Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
002:009 and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites,
        and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin,
        and over all Israel.
002:010 Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began
        to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years.
        But the house of Judah followed David.
002:011 The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah
        was seven years and six months.
002:012 Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
        of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
002:013 Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
        and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down,
        the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other
        side of the pool.
002:014 Abner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play
        before us.  Joab said, Let them arise.
002:015 Then they arose and went over by number:  twelve for Benjamin,
        and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the
        servants of David.
002:016 They caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust]
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim,
        which is in Gibeon.
002:017 The battle was very severe that day:  and Abner was beaten,
        and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
002:018 The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel:
        and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.
002:019 Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn
        to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel?
        He answered, It is I.
002:021 Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left,
        and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor.
        But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
002:022 Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me:
        why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold
        up my face to Joab your brother?
002:023 However he refused to turn aside:  therefore Abner with the hinder
        end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came
        out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place:
        and it happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel
        fell down and died stood still.
002:024 But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner:  and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
002:025 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
        and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever?
        Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
        How long shall it be then, before you bid the people return
        from following their brothers?"
002:027 Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then
        in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed
        everyone his brother.
002:028 So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still,
        and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
002:029 Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah;
        and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron,
        and came to Mahanaim.
002:030 Joab returned from following Abner:  and when he had gathered
        all the people together, there lacked of David's servants
        nineteen men and Asahel.
002:031 But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men,
        [so that] three hundred sixty men died.
002:032 They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father,
        which was in Bethlehem.  Joab and his men went all night,
        and the day broke on them at Hebron.
003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
        of David:  and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house
        of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
003:002 To David were sons born in Hebron:  and his firstborn was Amnon,
        of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
003:003 and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
        and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai
        king of Geshur;
003:004 and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
        Shephatiah the son of Abital;
003:005 and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife.
        These were born to David in Hebron.
003:006 It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul
        and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        in the house of Saul.
003:007 Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
        of Aiah:  and [Ishbosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone
        in to my father's concubine?
003:008 Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said,
        Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?  This day do I show
        kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand
        of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault
        concerning this woman.
003:009 God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn
        to David, I don't do even so to him;
003:010 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set
        up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan
        even to Beersheba.
003:011 He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
003:012 Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is
        the land? saying [also], Make your league with me, and behold,
        my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.
003:013 He said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing
        I require of you:  that is, you shall not see my face,
        except you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come
        to see my face.
003:014 David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me
        for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
003:015 Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Paltiel the son of Laish.
003:016 Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed
        her to Bahurim.  Then said Abner to him, Go, return:
        and he returned.
003:017 Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        In times past you sought for David to be king over you:
003:018 now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand
        of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand
        of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
003:019 Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin:  and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.
        David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.
003:021 Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel
        to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you,
        and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.
        David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
003:022 Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray,
        and brought in a great spoil with them:  but Abner was not
        with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
        gone in peace.
003:023 When Joab and all the army who was with him had come,
        they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king,
        and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold,
        Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away,
        and he is quite gone?
003:025 You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you,
        and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know
        all that you do.
003:026 When Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah:
        but David didn't know it.
003:027 When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into
        the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck
        him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood
        of Asahel his brother.
003:028 Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner:
003:029 let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house;
        and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has
        an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff,
        or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.
003:030 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had
        killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
003:031 David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him,
        Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner.  King David followed the bier.
003:032 They buried Abner in Hebron:  and the king lifted up his voice,
        and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
003:033 The king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die
        as a fool dies?
003:034 Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters.
        As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.
        All the people wept again over him.
003:035 All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day;
        but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also,
        if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down.
003:036 All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them;
        as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
003:037 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
        was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.
003:038 The king said to his servants, "Don't you know that there
        a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
003:039 I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
        the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me.  May Yahweh reward
        the evil-doer according to his wickedness."
004:001 When [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron,
        his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
004:002 [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men who were captains of bands:
        the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
        the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin
        (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
004:003 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners
        there until this day).
004:004 Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet.
        He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan
        out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled:
        and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
        and became lame.  His name was Mephibosheth.
004:005 The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
        and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth,
        as he took his rest at noon.
004:006 They came there into the midst of the house, as though they
        would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body:
        and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
004:007 Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed
        in his bedchamber, they struck him, and killed him,
        and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way
        of the Arabah all night.
004:008 They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron,
        and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth,
        the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life;
        and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul,
        and of his seed.
004:009 David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons
        of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives,
        who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
004:010 when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
        brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag,
        which was the reward I gave him for his news.
004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
        in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood
        of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
004:012 David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut
        off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside
        the pool in Hebron.  But they took the head of Ishbosheth,
        and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron,
        and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
005:002 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you
        who led out and brought in Israel:  and Yahweh said to you,
        You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall
        be prince over Israel.
005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
        and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh:
        and they anointed David king over Israel.
005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned forty years.
005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months;
        and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all
        Israel and Judah.
005:006 The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites,
        the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying,
        Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not
        come in here; thinking, David can't come in here.
005:007 Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is
        the city of David.
005:008 David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites,
        let him get up to the watercourse, and [strike]
        the lame and the blind, who are hated of David's soul.
        Therefore they say, There are the blind and the lame;
        he can't come into the house.
005:009 David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David.
        David built round about from Millo and inward.
005:010 David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies,
        was with him.
005:011 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
        and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
005:012 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel,
        and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
005:013 David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
        after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons
        and daughters born to David.
005:014 These are the names of those who were born to him
        in Jerusalem:  Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
005:015 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
005:016 and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
005:017 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
        over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David;
        and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
005:018 Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the
        valley of Rephaim.
005:019 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against
        the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand?
        Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver
        the Philistines into your hand.
005:020 David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said,
        Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.
        Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
005:021 They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
005:022 The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
        in the valley of Rephaim.
005:023 When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You shall not go up:
        make a circuit behind them, and come on them over against
        the mulberry trees.
005:024 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops
        of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself;
        for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the army
        of the Philistines.
005:025 David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines
        from Geba until you come to Gezer.
006:001 David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
        thirty thousand.
006:002 David arose, and went with all the people who were with him,
        from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God,
        which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies
        who sits [above] the cherubim.
006:003 They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it
        out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill:
        and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
006:004 They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill,
        with the ark of God:  and Ahio went before the ark.
006:005 David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all
        manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, and with harps,
        and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines,
        and with castanets, and with cymbals.
006:006 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put
        forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it;
        for the oxen stumbled.
006:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck
        him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
006:008 David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah;
        and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.
006:009 David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How shall
        the ark of Yahweh come to me?
006:010 So David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into
        the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house
        of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
006:011 The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom
        the Gittite three months:  and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom,
        and all his house.
006:012 It was told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house
        of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark
        of God.  David went and brought up the ark of God from the house
        of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.
006:013 It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone
        six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
006:014 David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was
        girded with a linen ephod.
006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh
        with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
006:016 It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David,
        that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window,
        and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh;
        and she despised him in her heart.
006:017 They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place,
        in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David
        offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
006:018 When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering
        and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name
        of Yahweh of Armies.
006:019 He dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
        of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a cake
        of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins.
        So all the people departed everyone to his house.
006:020 Then David returned to bless his household.
        Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said,
        How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered
        himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants,
        as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
006:021 David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me
        above your father, and above all his house, to appoint
        me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel:
        therefore will I play before Yahweh.
006:022 I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my
        own sight:  but of the handmaids of whom you have spoken,
        they shall honor me.
006:023 Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
007:001 It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh
        had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
007:002 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
        in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
007:003 Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart;
        for Yahweh is with you.
007:004 It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came
        to Nathan, saying,
007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh, Shall you
        build me a house for me to dwell in?
007:006 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought
        up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day,
        but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.
007:007 In all places in which I have walked with all the children
        of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
        whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying,
        Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
007:008 Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says
        Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following
        the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel;
007:009 and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all
        your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name,
        like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
007:010 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
        that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more;
        neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more,
        as at the first,
007:011 and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies.
        Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.
007:012 When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers,
        I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out
        of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
007:013 He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish
        the throne of his kingdom forever.
007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son:
        if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men,
        and with the stripes of the children of men;
007:015 but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took
        it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
007:016 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you:
        your throne shall be established forever.
007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
        so did Nathan speak to David.
007:018 Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh;
        and he said, Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house,
        that you have brought me thus far?
007:019 This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have
        spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come;
        and this [too] after the manner of men, Lord Yahweh!
007:020 What can David say more to you? for you know your servant,
        Lord Yahweh.
007:021 For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you
        worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
007:022 Therefore you are great, Yahweh God:  for there is none like you,
        neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we
        have heard with our ears.
007:023 What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make
        him a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things
        for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to you
        out of Egypt, [from] the nations and their gods?
007:024 You did establish to yourself your people Israel to be a people
        to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
007:025 Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning
        your servant, and concerning his house, confirm you it forever,
        and do as you have spoken.
007:026 Let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies
        is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall
        be established before you.
007:027 For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed
        to your servant, saying, I will build you a house:
        therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this
        prayer to you.
007:028 Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth,
        and you have promised this good thing to your servant:
007:029 now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant,
        that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh,
        have spoken it:  and with your blessing let the house of your
        servant be blessed forever.
008:001 After this it happened that David struck the Philistines,
        and subdued them:  and David took the bridle of the mother
        city out of the hand of the Philistines.
008:002 He struck Moab, and measured them with the line,
        making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two
        lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive.
        The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
008:003 David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
        as he went to recover his dominion at the River.
008:004 David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty
        thousand footmen:  and David hamstrung all the chariot horses,
        but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
008:005 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king
        of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the
        Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
008:007 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
008:008 From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
        took exceeding much brass.
008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all
        the army of Hadadezer,
008:010 then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to Greet him,
        and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer
        and struck him:  for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.
        [Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold,
        and vessels of brass:
008:011 These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver
        and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
008:012 of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
        the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
        son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
008:013 David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians
        in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
008:014 He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
        and all the Edomites became servants to David.
        Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
008:015 David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice
        and righteousness to all his people.
008:016 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;
008:017 and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,
        were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
008:018 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.
009:001 David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul,
        that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
009:002 There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba,
        and they called him to David; and the king said to him,
        Are you Ziba?  He said, Your servant is he.
009:003 The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I
        may show the kindness of God to him?  Ziba said to the king,
        Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.
009:004 The king said to him, Where is he?  Ziba said to the king,
        Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel,
        in Lo Debar.
009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir
        the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
009:006 Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
        came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance.
        David said, Mephibosheth.  He answered, Behold, your servant!
009:007 David said to him, "Don't be afraid of him; for I will
        surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake,
        and will restore you all the land of Saul your father;
        and you shall eat bread at my table continually."
009:008 He did obeisance, and said, "What is your servant, that you
        should look on such a dead dog as I am?"
009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him,
        "All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given
        to your master's son.
009:010 You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons,
        and your servants; and you shall bring in [the fruits],
        that your master's son may have bread to eat:  but Mephibosheth
        your master's son shall eat bread always at my table."
        Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
009:011 Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord
        the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do.
        As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table,
        as one of the king's sons.
009:012 Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
        All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
009:013 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually
        at the king's table.  He was lame in both his feet.
010:001 It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died,
        and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
010:002 David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,
        as his father shown kindness to me.  So David sent
        by his servants to comfort him concerning his father.
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
010:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun
        their lord, Do you think that David honors your father,
        in that he has sent comforters to you?  Hasn't David sent
        his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out,
        and to overthrow it?
010:004 So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half
        of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,
        even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
010:005 When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men
        were greatly ashamed.  The king said, Wait at Jericho until
        your beards be grown, and then return.
010:006 When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious
        to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians
        of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen,
        and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men
        of Tob twelve thousand men.
010:007 When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army
        of the mighty men.
010:008 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
        at the entrance of the gate:  and the Syrians of Zobah and
        of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves
        in the field.
010:009 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians:
010:010 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai
        his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
010:011 He said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall
        help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you,
        then I will come and help you.
010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people,
        and for the cities of our God:  and Yahweh do that which
        seems him good.
010:013 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle
        against the Syrians:  and they fled before him.
010:014 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city.
        Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon,
        and came to Jerusalem.
010:015 When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
        they gathered themselves together.
010:016 Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond
        the River:  and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain
        of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
010:017 It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam.  The Syrians
        set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
010:018 The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians
        [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen,
        and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that
        he died there.
010:019 When all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they
        were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel,
        and served them.  So the Syrians feared to help the children
        of Ammon any more.
011:001 It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go
        out [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him,
        and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon,
        and besieged Rabbah.  But David stayed at Jerusalem.
011:002 It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed,
        and walked on the roof of the king's house:  and from the roof
        he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful
        to look on.
011:003 David send and inquired after the woman.  One said,
        Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife
        of Uriah the Hittite?
011:004 David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him,
        and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness);
        and she returned to her house.
011:005 The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said,
        I am with child.
011:006 David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite.
        Joab sent Uriah to David.
011:007 When Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did,
        and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
011:008 David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet.
        Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed
        him a mess [of food] from the king.
011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all
        the servants of his lord, and didn't go down to his house.
011:010 When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house,
        David said to Uriah, Haven't you come from a journey? why
        did you not go down to your house?
011:011 Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
        abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
        are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house,
        to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live,
        and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
011:012 David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I
        will let you depart.  So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
        and the next day.
011:013 When David had called him, he ate and drink before him;
        and he made him drunk:  and at even he went out to lie on
        his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn't go down
        to his house.
011:014 It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab,
        and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
011:015 He wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront
        of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may
        be struck, and die.
011:016 It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned
        Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.
011:017 The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab:
        and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David;
        and Uriah the Hittite died also.
011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
011:019 and he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end
        of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,
011:020 it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he tells you,
        'Why did you go so near to the city to fight?  Didn't you
        know that they would shoot from the wall?
011:021 who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  Didn't a woman
        cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died
        at Thebez?  Why did you go so near the wall?' then shall you say,
        'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shown David all that Joab
        had sent him for.
011:023 The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us,
        and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even
        to the entrance of the gate.
011:024 The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall;
        and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant
        Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
011:025 Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don't let
        this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well
        as another; make your battle more strong against the city,
        and overthrow it:  and encourage you him.
011:026 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,
        she made lamentation for her husband.
011:027 When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home
        to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.
        But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.
012:001 Yahweh sent Nathan to David.  He came to him, and said
        to him, "There were two men in one city; the one rich,
        and the other poor.
012:002 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
012:003 but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb,
        which he had bought and raised.  It grew up together with him,
        and with his children.  It ate of his own food, drank of his
        own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter.
012:004 A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his
        own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
        man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb,
        and dressed it for the man who had come to him."
012:005 David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said
        to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this is
        worthy to die!
012:006 He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,
        and because he had no pity!"
012:007 Nathan said to David, "You are the man.  This is what Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, says:  'I anointed you king over Israel,
        and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
012:008 I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into
        your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah;
        and if that would have been too little, I would have added
        to you many more such things.
012:009 Why have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which
        is evil in his sight?  You have struck Uriah the Hittite
        with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife,
        and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
012:010 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house,
        because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah
        the Hittite to be your wife.'
012:011 This is what Yahweh says:  'Behold, I will raise up evil
        against you out of your own house; and I will take your
        wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor,
        and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
012:012 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel,
        and before the sun.'"
012:013 David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh."
        Nathan said to David, "Yahweh also has put away your sin.
        You will not die.
012:014 However, because by this deed you have given great occasion
        to Yahweh's enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born
        to you shall surely die."
012:015 Nathan departed to his house.  Yahweh struck the child that
        Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
012:016 David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted,
        and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
012:017 The elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him,
        to raise him up from the earth:  but he would not, neither did
        he eat bread with them.
012:018 It happened on the seventh day, that the child died.
        The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead;
        for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive,
        we spoke to him, and he didn't listen to our voice:
        how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
        child is dead!
012:019 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together,
        David perceived that the child was dead; and David said
        to his servants, Is the child dead?  They said, He is dead.
012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,
        and changed his clothing; and he came into the house
        of Yahweh, and worshiped:  then he came to his own house;
        and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
012:021 Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have
        done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;
        but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
012:022 He said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
        for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me,
        that the child may live?
012:023 But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again?
        I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
012:024 David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay
        with her:  and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon.
        Yahweh loved him;
012:025 and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named
        him Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.
012:026 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and took the royal city.
012:027 Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
        against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of waters.
012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together,
        and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city,
        and it be called after my name.
012:029 David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
        and fought against it, and took it.
012:030 He took the crown of their king from off his head;
        and the weight of it was a talent of gold, and [in it
        were] precious stones; and it was set on David's head.
        He brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
012:031 He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them
        under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes
        of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln:
        and thus did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
013:001 It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had
        a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son
        of David loved her.
013:002 Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar;
        for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do
        anything to her.
013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son
        of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
013:004 He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day
        to day?  Won't you tell me?  Amnon said to him, I love Tamar,
        my brother Absalom's sister.
013:005 Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign
        yourself sick:  and when your father comes to see you,
        tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread
        to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it,
        and eat it from her hand.
013:006 So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick:  and when the king
        was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her
        sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight,
        that I may eat from her hand.
013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother
        Amnon's house, and dress him food.
013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.
        She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight,
        and did bake the cakes.
013:009 She took the pan, and poured them out before him;
        but he refused to eat.  Amnon said, Have out all men from me.
        They went out every man from him.
013:010 Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may
        eat from your hand.  Tamar took the cakes which she had made,
        and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
013:011 When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her,
        and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
013:012 She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such
        thing ought to be done in Israel.  Don't you do this folly.
013:013 I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be
        as one of the fools in Israel.  Now therefore, please speak
        to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
013:014 However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger
        than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
013:015 Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred
        with which he hated her was greater than the love with which
        he had loved her.  Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
013:016 She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting
        me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me.
        But he would not listen to her.
013:017 Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said,
        Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
013:018 She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such
        robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed.
        Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
013:019 Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various
        colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head,
        and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
013:020 Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother
        been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister:
        he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart.
        So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
013:022 Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom
        hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
013:023 It happened after two full years, that Absalom had
        sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim:
        and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
013:024 Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant
        has sheepshearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants
        go with your servant.
013:025 The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go,
        lest we be burdensome to you.  He pressed him:
        however he would not go, but blessed him.
013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.
        The king said to him, Why should he go with you?
013:027 But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's
        sons go with him.
013:028 Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now,
        when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you,
        Smite Amnon, then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I
        commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
013:029 The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
        Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up
        on his mule, and fled.
013:030 It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came
        to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons,
        and there is not one of them left.
013:031 Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth;
        and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
013:032 Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, Don't let
        my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men
        the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment
        of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced
        his sister Tamar.
013:033 Now therefore don't let my lord the king take the thing
        to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead;
        for Amnon only is dead.
013:034 But Absalom fled.  The young man who kept the watch lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming
        by way of the hillside behind him.
013:035 Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are come:
        as your servant said, so it is.
013:036 It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold,
        the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept:
        and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur,
        king of Geshur.  [David] mourned for his son every day.
013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
013:039 [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom:
        for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
        was toward Absalom.
014:002 Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman,
        and said to her, please act like a mourner, and put on
        mourning clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil,
        but be as a woman who has a long time mourned for the dead:
014:003 and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him.
        So Joab put the words in her mouth.
014:004 When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face
        to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
014:005 The king said to her, What ails you?  She answered, Of a truth
        I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
014:006 Your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field,
        and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other,
        and killed him.
014:007 Behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid,
        and they say, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we
        may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed,
        and so destroy the heir also.  Thus will they quench my coal
        which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor
        remainder on the surface of the earth.
014:008 The king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give
        charge concerning you.
014:009 The woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king,
        the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king
        and his throne be guiltless.
014:010 The king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me,
        and he shall not touch you any more.
014:011 Then said she, Please let the king remember Yahweh your God,
        that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they
        destroy my son.  He said, As Yahweh lives, there shall not
        one hair of your son fall to the earth.
014:012 Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word
        to my lord the king.  He said, Say on.
014:013 The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against
        the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is
        as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home
        again his banished one.
014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground,
        which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take
        away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be
        an outcast from him.
014:015 Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my
        lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
        and your handmaid said, I will now speak to the king;
        it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand
        of the man who would destroy me and my son together out
        of the inheritance of God.
014:017 Then your handmaid said, Please let the word of my lord the king
        be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king
        to discern good and bad:  and Yahweh your God be with you.
014:018 Then the king answered the woman, Please don't hide anything
        from me that I shall ask you.  The woman said, Let my lord
        the king now speak.
014:019 The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?
        The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord the king,
        none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything
        that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab,
        he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth
        of your handmaid;
014:020 to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done
        this thing:  and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom
        of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
014:021 The king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
        go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
014:022 Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance,
        and blessed the king:  and Joab said, Today your servant knows
        that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that
        the king has performed the request of his servant.
014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
014:024 The king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him
        not see my face.  So Absalom turned to his own house,
        and didn't see the king's face.
014:025 Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom
        for his beauty:  from the sole of his foot even to the crown
        of his head there was no blemish in him.
014:026 When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end
        that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it);
        he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels,
        after the king's weight.
014:027 To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
        whose name was Tamar:  she was a woman of a beautiful face.
014:028 Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see
        the king's face.
014:029 Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king;
        but he would not come to him:  and he sent again a second time,
        but he would not come.
014:030 Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's field is
        near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.
        Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said
        to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
014:032 Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here,
        that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come
        from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still.
        Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be
        iniquity in me, let him kill me.
014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called
        for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face
        to the ground before the king:  and the king kissed Absalom.
015:001 It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot
        and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
015:002 Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
        and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should
        come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him,
        and said, Of what city are you?  He said, Your servant is
        of one of the tribes of Israel.
015:003 Absalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right;
        but there is no man deputized of the king to hear you.
015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
        that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me,
        and I would do him justice!
015:005 It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance,
        he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
015:006 In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king
        for judgment:  so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
015:007 It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said
        to the king, please let me go and pay my vow, which I have
        vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.
015:008 For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
        saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem,
        then I will serve Yahweh.
015:009 The king said to him, Go in peace.  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet,
        then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
015:011 With Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited,
        and went in their simplicity; and they didn't know anything.
015:012 Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor,
        from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering
        the sacrifices.  The conspiracy was strong; for the people
        increased continually with Absalom.
015:013 There came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men
        of Israel are after Absalom.
015:014 David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise,
        and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom:
        make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring
        down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
015:015 The king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants
        are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.
015:016 The king went forth, and all his household after him.
        The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.
015:017 The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they
        stayed in Beth Merhak.
015:018 All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
        and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men
        who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with
        us? return, and abide with the king:  for you are a foreigner,
        and also an exile; [return] to your own place.
015:020 Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go
        up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? return you,
        and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you.
015:021 Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my
        lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king
        shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will
        your servant be.
015:022 David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.  Ittai the Gittite
        passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who
        were with him.
015:023 All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
        passed over:  the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron,
        and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
015:024 Behold, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him,
        bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down
        the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people
        had done passing out of the city.
015:025 The king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city:
        if I shall find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, he will bring
        me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
015:026 but if he say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I,
        let him do to me as seems good to him.
015:027 The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer?
        Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
        Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
015:028 Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word
        comes from you to inform me."
015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again
        to Jerusalem:  and they abode there.
015:030 David went up by the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept
        as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot:
        and all the people who were with him covered every man his head,
        and they went up, weeping as they went up.
015:031 One told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
        with Absalom.  David said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel
        of Ahithophel into foolishness.
015:032 It happened that when David had come to the top [of the ascent],
        where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came
        to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.
015:033 David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be
        a burden to me:
015:034 but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be
        your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant
        in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you
        defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
015:035 Don't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you?
        therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear
        out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and
        Abiathar the priests.
015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons,
        Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them
        you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.
015:037 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom
        came into Jerusalem.
016:001 When David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold,
        Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple
        of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread,
        and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits,
        and a bottle of wine.
016:002 The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these?
        Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on;
        and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat;
        and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
016:003 The king said, Where is your master's son?  Ziba said
        to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said,
        Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
        of my father.
016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains
        to Mephibosheth is yours.  Ziba said, I do obeisance;
        let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.
016:005 When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of
        the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera.
        He came out, and cursed still as he came.
016:006 He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
        and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right
        hand and on his left.
016:007 Thus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man
        of blood, and base fellow:
016:008 Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul,
        in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered
        the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and behold,
        you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a
        man of blood.
016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king,
        "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?
        Please let me go over and take off his head."
016:010 The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons
        of Zeruiah?  Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said
        to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?
016:011 David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold,
        my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life:
        how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone,
        and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.
016:012 It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me,
        and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing
        of me this day.
016:013 So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along
        on the hillside over against him, and cursed as he went,
        and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
016:014 The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary;
        and he refreshed himself there.
016:015 Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
        and Ahithophel with him.
016:016 It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come
        to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king,
        [Long] live the king.
016:017 Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend?
        Why didn't you go with your friend?
016:018 Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people,
        and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be,
        and with him will I abide.
016:019 Again, whom should I serve?  Shouldn't I serve in the presence
        of his son? as I have served in your father's presence,
        so will I be in your presence.
016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what
        we shall do.
016:021 Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines,
        that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear
        that you are abhorred of your father:  then will the hands
        of all who are with you be strong.
016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house;
        and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight
        of all Israel.
016:023 The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days,
        was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God:  so was all
        the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose
        out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after
        David this night:
017:002 and I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will
        make him afraid; and all the people who are with him shall flee;
        and I will strike the king only;
017:003 and I will bring back all the people to you:  the man whom
        you seek is as if all returned:  [so] all the people shall
        be in peace.
017:004 The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
        us hear likewise what he says.
017:006 When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him,
        saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner:
        shall we do [after] his saying? if not, speak up.
017:007 Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given
        this time is not good.
017:008 Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men,
        that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds,
        as a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father
        is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place:
        and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first,
        that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among
        the people who follow Absalom.
017:010 Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
        will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father
        is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
017:011 But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea
        for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
017:012 So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found,
        and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground;
        and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not
        leave so much as one.
017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
        bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
        until there not be one small stone found there.
017:014 Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
        the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
        For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel,
        to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.
017:015 Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
        thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
        and thus and thus have I counseled.
017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge
        this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means
        pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people
        who are with him.
017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female
        servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David:
        for they might not be seen to come into the city.
017:018 But a boy saw them, and told Absalom:  and they went both of them
        away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim,
        who had a well in his court; and they went down there.
017:019 The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth,
        and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.
017:020 Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said,
        Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?  The woman said to them,
        They have gone over the brook of water.  When they had sought
        and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
017:021 It happened, after they had departed, that they came up
        out of the well, and went and told king David; and they
        said to David, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water;
        for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.
017:022 Then David arose, and all the people who were with him,
        and they passed over the Jordan:  by the morning light there
        lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.
017:023 When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,
        he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city,
        and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died,
        and was buried in the tomb of his father.
017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim.  Absalom passed over the Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.
017:025 Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab.
        Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra
        the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
017:026 Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
017:027 It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
        the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai
        the Gileadite of Rogelim,
017:028 brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat,
        and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans,
        and lentils, and parched [pulse],
017:029 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd,
        for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat:
        for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty,
        in the wilderness.
018:001 David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains
        of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
018:002 David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son
        of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand
        of Ittai the Gittite.  The king said to the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.
018:003 But the people said, You shall not go forth:  for if we flee away,
        they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
        will they care for us:  but you are worth ten thousand of us;
        therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us
        out of the city.
018:004 The king said to them, What seems you best I will do.
        The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out
        by hundreds and by thousands.
018:005 The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
        gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        All the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.
018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel:
        and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
018:007 The people of Israel were struck there before the servants
        of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day
        of twenty thousand men.
018:008 For the battle was there spread over the surface of all
        the country; and the forest devoured more people that day
        than the sword devoured.
018:009 Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.
        Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under
        the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold
        of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth;
        and the mule that was under him went on.
018:010 A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
        Absalom hanging in an oak.
018:011 Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it,
        and why didn't you strike him there to the ground? and I
        would have given you ten [pieces of] silver, and a sash.
018:012 The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        [pieces of] silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth
        my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king
        charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.
018:013 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there
        is no matter hid from the king), then you yourself would
        have set yourself against [me].
018:014 Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you.  He took three darts
        in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom,
        while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
018:015 Ten young men who bore Joab's armor compassed about and
        struck Absalom, and killed him.
018:016 Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
        after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
018:017 They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest,
        and raised over him a very great heap of stones:
        and all Israel fled everyone to his tent.
018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up
        for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale;
        for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory:
        and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called
        Absalom's monument, to this day.
018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king news, how that Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.
018:020 Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day,
        but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall
        bear no news, because the king's son is dead.
018:021 Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen.
        The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come
        what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite.
        Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will
        have no reward for the news?
018:023 But come what may, [said he], I will run.  He said to him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
018:024 Now David was sitting between the two gates:  and the watchman
        went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up
        his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
018:025 The watchman cried, and told the king.  The king said,
        If he be alone, there is news in his mouth.  He came apace,
        and drew near.
018:026 The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called
        to the porter, and said, Behold, [another] man running alone.
        The king said, He also brings news.
018:027 The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is
        like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.  The king said,
        He is a good man, and comes with good news.
018:028 Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well.
        He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth,
        and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up
        the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
018:029 The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?
        Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant,
        even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know
        what it was.
018:030 The king said, Turn aside, and stand here.  He turned aside,
        and stood still.
018:031 Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my
        lord the king; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all
        those who rose up against you.
018:032 The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young
        man Absalom?  The Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord
        the king, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt,
        be as that young man is.
018:033 The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,
        and wept:  and as he went, thus he said, my son Absalom,
        my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom,
        my son, my son!
019:001 It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
019:002 The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people;
        for the people heard say that day, The king grieves for his son.
019:003 The people got them by stealth that day into the city,
        as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
019:004 The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
        my son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!
019:005 Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed
        this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved
        your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters,
        and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
019:006 in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you.
        For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are
        nothing to you:  for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived,
        and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably
        to your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't
        go forth, there will not stay a man with you this night:
        and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has
        happened to you from your youth until now.
019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  They told to all
        the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate:
        and all the people came before the king.  Now Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.
019:009 All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
        of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of
        our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines;
        and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
019:010 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
        Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing
        the king back?
019:011 King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
        Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last
        to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all
        Israel is come to the king, [to bring him] to his house.
019:012 You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh:
        why then are you the last to bring back the king?
019:013 Say you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain
        of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.
019:014 He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of]
        one man; so that they sent to the king, [saying], Return you,
        and all your servants.
019:015 So the king returned, and came to the Jordan.  Judah came to Gilgal,
        to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
019:016 Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim,
        hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
019:017 There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan
        in the presence of the king.
019:018 A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household,
        and to do what he thought good.  Shimei the son of Gera fell
        down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
019:019 He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me,
        neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely
        the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,
        that the king should take it to his heart.
019:020 For your servant does know that I have sinned:  therefore, behold,
        I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go
        down to meet my lord the king.
019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be
        put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh's anointed?
019:022 David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah,
        that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there
        any man be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know
        that I am this day king over Israel?
019:023 The king said to Shimei, You shall not die.  The king
        swore to him.
019:024 Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king;
        and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard,
        nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until
        the day he came home in peace.
019:025 It happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
        that the king said to him, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?
019:026 He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me:
        for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may
        ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.
019:027 He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord
        the king is as an angel of God:  do therefore what is good
        in your eyes.
019:028 For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king;
        yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table.
        What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more
        to the king?
019:029 The king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters?
        I say, You and Ziba divide the land.
019:030 Mephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all,
        because my lord the king is come in peace to his own house.
019:031 Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went
        over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old:
        and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay
        at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
019:033 The king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I
        will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.
019:034 Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years
        of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
019:035 I am this day eighty years old:  can I discern between good
        and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
        can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
        women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my
        lord the king?
019:036 Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
019:037 Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die
        in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother.
        But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord
        the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.
019:038 The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me,
        and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you:
        and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
019:039 All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over:
        and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned
        to his own place.
019:040 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him:
        and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half
        the people of Israel.
019:041 Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king,
        Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away,
        and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan,
        and all David's men with him?
019:042 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king
        is a close relative to us:  why then are you angry for this
        matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or has
        he given us any gift?
019:043 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
        We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right]
        in David than you:  why then did you despise us, that our
        advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?
        The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words
        of the men of Israel.
020:001 There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba,
        the son of Bichri, a Benjamite:  and he blew the trumpet,
        and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance
        in the son of Jesse:  every man to his tents, Israel.
020:002 So all the men of Israel went up from following David,
        and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah
        joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
020:003 David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
        women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house,
        and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance,
        but didn't go in to them.  So they were shut up to the day
        of their death, living in widowhood.
020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together
        within three days, and be here present.
020:005 So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
020:006 David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us
        more harm than did Absalom:  take your lord's servants,
        and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities,
        and escape out of our sight.
020:007 There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went
        out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came
        to meet them.  Joab was girded with his apparel of war that
        he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened
        on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
020:009 Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother?
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels
        to the ground, and didn't strike him again; and he died.
        Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:011 There stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who
        favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.
020:012 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway.
        When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa
        out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him,
        when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
        on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
020:014 He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah,
        and all the Berites:  and they were gathered together,
        and went also after him.
020:015 They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast
        up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart;
        and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall,
        to throw it down.
020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear!
        Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
020:017 He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab?  He answered,
        I am.  Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid.
        He answered, I do hear.
020:018 Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in
        old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel:
        and so they ended [the matter].
020:019 I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
        why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?
020:020 Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should
        swallow up or destroy.
020:021 The matter is not so:  but a man of the hill country
        of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted
        up his hand against the king, even against David;
        deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.
        The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown
        to you over the wall.
020:022 Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom.
        They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri,
        and threw it out to Joab.  He blew the trumpet, and they
        were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent.
        Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
020:023 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
020:024 and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor;
        and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
020:025 and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
020:026 and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
021:001 There was a famine in the days of David three years,
        year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh.
        Yahweh said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house,
        because he put to death the Gibeonites.
021:002 The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites
        were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of
        the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them:
        and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children
        of Israel and Judah);
021:003 and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
        And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless
        the inheritance of Yahweh?
021:004 The Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold
        between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put
        any man to death in Israel.  He said, What you shall say,
        that will I do for you.
021:005 They said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised
        against us, [that] we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the borders of Israel,
021:006 let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang
        them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.
        The king said, I will give them.
021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel
        the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
021:009 He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
        hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell [all]
        seven together.  They were put to death in the days of harvest,
        in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
021:010 Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
        was poured on them from the sky; and she allowed neither
        the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals
        of the field by night.
021:011 It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
        of Saul, had done.
021:012 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
        his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from
        the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them,
        in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;
021:013 and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son:  and they gathered the bones of those
        who were hanged.
021:014 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country
        of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father:
        and they performed all that the king commanded.
        After that God was entreated for the land.
021:015 The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down,
        and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines.
        David grew faint;
021:016 and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight,
        he being girded with a new [sword], thought to have slain David.
021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck
        the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David swore
        to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle,
        that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.
021:018 It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the
        Philistines at Gob:  then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph,
        who was of the sons of the giant.
021:019 There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan
        the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath
        the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like
        a weaver's beam.
021:020 There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
        who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes,
        four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
021:021 When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother,
        killed him.
021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell
        by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
022:001 David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day
        that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,
        and out of the hand of Saul:
022:002 and he said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
        even mine;
022:003 God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield,
        and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge.
        My savior, you save me from violence.
022:004 I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
        So shall I be saved from my enemies.
022:005 For the waves of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
        made me afraid.
022:006 The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death caught me.
022:007 In my distress I called on Yahweh.  Yes, I called to my God.
        He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry [came] into his ears.
022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations of heaven
        quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
022:009 Smoke went up out of his nostrils.  Fire out of his mouth devoured.
        Coals were kindled by it.
022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
        was under his feet.
022:011 He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he was seen on the wings
        of the wind.
022:012 He made darkness pavilions around himself:  gathering of waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.
022:013 At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.
022:014 Yahweh thundered from heaven.  The Most High uttered his voice.
022:015 He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
022:016 Then the channels of the sea appeared.  The foundations of
        the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast
        of the breath of his nostrils.
022:017 He sent from on high and he took me.  He drew me out
        of many waters.
022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me,
        for they were too mighty for me.
022:019 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
        was my support.
022:020 He also brought me out into a large place.  He delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.
022:021 Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
        He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
022:022 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.
022:023 For all his ordinances were before me.  As for his statutes,
        I did not depart from them.
022:024 I was also perfect toward him.  I kept myself from my iniquity.
022:025 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
        According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
022:026 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
        With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.
022:027 With the pure you will show yourself pure.  With the crooked
        you will show yourself shrewd.
022:028 You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on
        the haughty, that you may bring them down.
022:029 For you are my lamp, Yahweh.  Yahweh will light up my darkness.
022:030 For by you, I run against a troop.  By my God, I leap over a wall.
022:031 As for God, his way is perfect.  The word of Yahweh is tested.
        He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
022:032 For who is God, besides Yahweh?  Who is a rock, besides our God?
022:033 God is my strong fortress.  He makes my way perfect.
022:034 He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], and sets me on
        my high places.
022:035 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
022:036 You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
        Your gentleness has made me great.
022:037 You have enlarged my steps under me.  My feet have not slipped.
022:038 I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.  I didn't turn
        again until they were consumed.
022:039 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they
        can't arise.  Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
022:040 For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
        You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
022:041 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
        might cut off those who hate me.
022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh,
        but he didn't answer them.
022:043 Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
        I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
022:044 You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
        You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
        A people whom I have not known will serve me.
022:045 The foreigners will submit themselves to me.  As soon as they
        hear of me, they will obey me.
022:046 The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out
        of their close places.
022:047 Yahweh lives!  Blessed be my rock!  Exalted be God, the rock
        of my salvation,
022:048 even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down
        peoples under me,
022:049 who brings me away from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up
        above those who rise up against me.  You deliver me from
        the violent man.
022:050 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
        Will sing praises to your name.
022:051 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness
        to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.
023:001 Now these are the last words of David.  David the son of Jesse says,
        the man who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God
        of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:
023:002 The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me.  His word was on my tongue.
023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
        one who rules over men righteously, who rules in the fear of God,
023:004 [He shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,
        a morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs]
        out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.
023:005 Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made
        with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things,
        and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all [my] desire,
        although he doesn't make it grow.
023:006 But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,
        because they can't be taken with the hand,
023:007 But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and
        the staff of a spear.  They shall be utterly burned with fire
        in [their] place.
023:008 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:
        Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains;
        the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain
        at one time.
023:009 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite,
        one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied
        the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle,
        and the men of Israel were gone away.
023:010 He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary,
        and his hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great
        victory that day; and the people returned after him only
        to take spoil.
023:011 After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite.
        The Philistines were gathered together into a troop,
        where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people
        fled from the Philistines.
023:012 But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it,
        and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.
023:013 Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David
        in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop
        of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
023:014 David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
023:015 David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink
        of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
023:016 The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines,
        and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was
        by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
        but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.
023:017 He said, Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this:
        [shall I drink] the blood of the men who went in jeopardy
        of their lives? therefore he would not drink it.
        These things did the three mighty men.
023:018 Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
        of the three.  He lifted up his spear against three hundred
        and killed them, and had a name among the three.
023:019 Wasn't he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made
        their captain:  however he didn't attain to the [first] three.
023:020 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
        who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel
        of Moab:  he went down also and killed a lion in the midst
        of a pit in time of snow.
023:021 He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man:  and the Egyptian had
        a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff,
        and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son
        of Dodo of Bethlehem,
023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
023:027 Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai
        of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
023:030 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam
        the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
023:035 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers
        to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
023:038 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
023:039 Uriah the Hittite:  thirty-seven in all.
024:001 Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved
        David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
024:002 The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him,
        Go now back and forth through all the tribes of Israel,
        from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people,
        that I may know the sum of the people.
024:003 Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh your God add to the people,
        however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes
        of my lord the king see it:  but why does my lord the king
        delight in this thing?
024:004 Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab,
        and against the captains of the army.  Joab and the captains
        of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number
        the people of Israel.
024:005 They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right
        side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad,
        and to Jazer:
024:006 then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi;
        and they came to Dan Jaan, and round about to Sidon,
024:007 and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities
        of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out
        to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
024:008 So when they had gone back and forth through all the land,
        they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
024:009 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king:
        and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.
024:010 David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people.
        David said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I
        have done:  but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity
        of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
024:011 When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came
        to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
024:012 Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things:
        choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven
        years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee
        three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall
        there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you,
        and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
024:014 David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let us fall
        now into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are great;
        and let me not fall into the hand of man.
024:015 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even
        to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan
        even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
024:016 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem
        to destroy it, Yahweh repented him of the evil, and said
        to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough;
        now stay your hand.  The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing
        floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:017 David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people,
        and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely;
        but these sheep, what have they done?  Please let your hand
        be against me, and against my father's house.
024:018 Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar
        to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
024:019 David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
024:020 Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him:  and Araunah went out, and bowed himself
        before the king with his face to the ground.
024:021 Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?
        David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar
        to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
024:022 Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
        what seems good to him:  behold, the oxen for the burnt offering,
        and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen
        for the wood:
024:023 all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.  Araunah said
        to the king, Yahweh your God accept you.
024:024 The king said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly
        buy it of you at a price.  Neither will I offer burnt
        offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.
        So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty
        shekels of silver.
024:025 David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
        and peace offerings.  So Yahweh was entreated for the land,
        and the plague was stayed from Israel.
Book 11 1 Kings
001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he got no heat.
001:002 Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin:  and let her stand before
        the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom,
        that my lord the king may keep warm.
001:003 So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all
        the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite,
        and brought her to the king.
001:004 The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king,
        and ministered to him; but the king didn't know her intimately.
001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying,
        I will be king:  and he prepared him chariots and horsemen,
        and fifty men to run before him.
001:006 His father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why have you done so? and he was also a very goodly man;
        and he was born after Absalom.
001:007 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
        the priest:  and they following Adonijah helped him.
001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty
        men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
001:009 Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all
        his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah,
        the king's servants:
001:010 but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men,
        and Solomon his brother, he didn't call.
001:011 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
        Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns,
        and David our lord doesn't know it?
001:012 Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you
        may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
001:013 Go and get you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you,
        my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon
        your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
        why then does Adonijah reign?
001:014 Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will
        come in after you, and confirm your words.
001:015 Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber:  and the king
        was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering
        to the king.
001:016 Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king.  The king said,
        What would you?
001:017 She said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God
        to your handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon your son shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
001:018 Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king,
        don't know it:
001:019 and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
        and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest,
        and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called
        Solomon your servant.
001:020 You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you,
        that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him.
001:021 Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall
        be counted offenders.
001:022 Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet came in.
001:023 They told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet.
        When he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.
001:024 Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, Adonijah shall
        reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
001:025 For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings
        and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons,
        and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest;
        and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say,
        [Long] live king Adonijah.
001:026 But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest,
        and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.
001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown
        to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord
        the king after him?
001:028 Then king David answered, Call to me Bathsheba.
        She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
001:029 The king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed
        my soul out of all adversity,
001:030 most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me,
        and he shall sit on my throne in my place; most certainly
        so will I do this day.
001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance
        to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.
001:032 King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.  They came
        before the king.
001:033 The king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
        and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring
        him down to Gihon:
001:034 and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel; and blow you the trumpet, and say,
        [Long] live king Solomon.
001:035 Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit
        on my throne; for he shall be king in my place; and I have
        appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
001:036 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,
        and said, Amen:  Yahweh, the God of my lord the king,
        say so [too].
001:037 As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be
        he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne
        of my lord king David.
001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites,
        went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule,
        and brought him to Gihon.
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
001:044 and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest,
        and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
        and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused
        him to ride on the king's mule;
001:045 and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
        king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing,
        so that the city rang again.  This is the noise that
        you have heard.
001:046 Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
001:047 Moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord
        king David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon better
        than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne:
        and the king bowed himself on the bed.
001:048 Also thus said the king, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes
        even seeing it.
001:049 All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went
        every man his way.
001:050 Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went,
        and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
001:051 It was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon;
        for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar,
        saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not
        kill his servant with the sword.
001:052 Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall
        not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found
        in him, he shall die.
001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
        He came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said
        to him, Go to your house.
002:001 Now the days of David drew near that he should die;
        and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
002:002 I am going the way of all the earth:  be you strong therefore,
        and show yourself a man;
002:003 and keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways,
        to keep his statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances,
        and his testimonies, according to that which is written
        in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do,
        and wherever you turn yourself.
002:004 That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me,
        saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk
        before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
        there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
002:005 Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
        even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel,
        to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether,
        whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put
        the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist,
        and in his shoes that were on his feet.
002:006 Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let his gray
        head go down to Sheol in peace.
002:007 But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
        and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they
        came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
002:008 Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
        of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I
        went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan,
        and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, I will not put you
        to death with the sword.
002:009 Now therefore don't hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man;
        and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall
        bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.
002:010 David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
002:011 The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years;
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty-three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.
002:012 Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
        was established greatly.
002:013 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba
        the mother of Solomon.  She said, Come you peaceably?
        He said, Peaceably.
002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to tell you.
        She said, Say on.
002:015 He said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all
        Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign:
        however the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's;
        for it was his from Yahweh.
002:016 Now I ask one petition of you; don't deny me.  She said
        to him, Say on.
002:017 He said, "Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell
        you 'no'), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife."
002:018 Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.
002:019 Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him
        for Adonijah.  The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself
        to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be
        set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
002:020 Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; don't deny me.
        The king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.
002:021 She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
        your brother as wife.
002:022 King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag
        the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also;
        for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
        the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
002:023 Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me,
        and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against
        his own life.
002:024 Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me,
        and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made
        me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put
        to death this day.
002:025 King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell
        on him, so that he died.
002:026 To Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth,
        to your own fields; for you are worthy of death:
        but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bear
        the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because
        you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.
002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh,
        that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which he spoke
        concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
002:028 The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
        though he didn't turn after Absalom.  Joab fled to the Tent
        of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
002:029 It was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh,
        and behold, he is by the altar.  Then Solomon sent Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.
002:030 Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says
        the king, Come forth.  He said, No; but I will die here.
        Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,
        and thus he answered me.
002:031 The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him,
        and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab
        shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.
002:032 Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell
        on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed
        them with the sword, and my father David didn't know it,
        [to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel,
        and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.
002:033 So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on
        the head of his seed forever:  but to David, and to his seed,
        and to his house, and to his throne, shall there be peace
        for ever from Yahweh.
002:034 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him,
        and killed him; and he was buried in his own house
        in the wilderness.
002:035 The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army;
        and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
002:036 The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him,
        Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there,
        and don't go forth from there any where.
002:037 For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron,
        know you for certain that you shall surely die:
        your blood shall be on your own head.
002:038 Shimei said to the king, The saying is good:
        as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.
        Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
002:039 It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants
        of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath.
        They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.
002:040 Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish,
        to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his
        servants from Gath.
002:041 It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
        and was come again.
002:042 The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Didn't I
        adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain,
        that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where,
        you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I
        have heard is good.
002:043 Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment
        that I have charged you with?
002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness
        which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father:
        therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.
002:045 But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
        shall be established before Yahweh forever.
002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
        and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died.
        The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
003:001 Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
        Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
        until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house
        of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
003:002 Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there
        was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.
003:003 Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father:
        only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
003:004 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
        the great high place:  a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
        offer on that altar.
003:005 In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night;
        and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
003:006 Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father
        great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth,
        and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you;
        and you have kept for him this great loving kindness,
        that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it
        is this day.
003:007 Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead
        of David my father:  and I am but a little child; I don't
        know how to go out or come in.
003:008 Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen,
        a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.
003:009 Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge
        your people, that I may discern between good and evil;
        for who is able to judge this your great people?
003:010 The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
003:011 God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have
        not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches
        for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies,
        but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;
003:012 behold, I have done according to your word:  behold, I have
        given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there
        has been none like you before you, neither after you shall
        any arise like you.
003:013 I have also given you that which you have not asked,
        both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among
        the kings like you, all your days.
003:014 If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments,
        as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.
003:015 Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream:  and he came
        to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings,
        and made a feast to all his servants.
003:016 Then there came two women who were prostitutes, to the king,
        and stood before him.
003:017 The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house;
        and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
003:018 It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this
        woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no
        stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
003:019 This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it.
003:020 She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
        while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom,
        and laid her dead child in my bosom.
003:021 When I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead;
        but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was
        not my son, whom I bore.
003:022 The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead
        is your son.  This said, No; but the dead is your son,
        and the living is my son.  Thus they spoke before the king.
003:023 Then said the king, The one says, This is my son who lives,
        and your son is the dead:  and the other says, No; but your
        son is the dead, and my son is the living.
003:024 The king said, Get me a sword.  They brought a sword
        before the king.
003:025 The king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
        to the one, and half to the other.
003:026 Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king,
        for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord,
        give her the living child, and in no way kill it.
        But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.
003:027 Then the king answered, Give her the living child, and in no
        way kill it:  she is the mother of it.
003:028 All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
        and they feared the king:  for they saw that the wisdom of God
        was in him, to do justice.
004:001 King Solomon was king over all Israel.
004:002 These were the princes whom he had:  Azariah the son
        of Zadok, the priest;
004:003 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the
        son of Ahilud, the recorder;
004:004 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok
        and Abiathar were priests;
004:005 and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud
        the son of Nathan was chief minister, [and] the king's friend;
004:006 and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son
        of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor.
004:007 Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided
        food for the king and his household:  each man had to make
        provision for a month in the year.
004:008 These are their names:  Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
004:009 Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh,
        and Elon Beth Hanan;
004:010 Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him [pertained] Socoh, and all
        the land of Hepher);
004:011 Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath
        the daughter of Solomon as wife);
004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all
        Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel,
        from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
004:013 Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him [pertained] the towns
        of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; [even] to
        him [pertained] the region of Argob, which is in Bashan,
        sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
004:015 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter
        of Solomon as wife);
004:016 Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
004:018 Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
004:019 Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country
        of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan;
        and [he was] the only officer who was in the land.
004:020 Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea
        in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
004:021 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to
        the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt:
        they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days
        of his life.
004:022 Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour,
        and sixty measures of meal,
004:023 ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and one
        hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks,
        and fattened fowl.
004:024 For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River,
        from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side
        the River:  and he had peace on all sides round about him.
004:025 Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine
        and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        all the days of Solomon.
004:026 Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
        and twelve thousand horsemen.
004:027 Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all
        who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month;
        they let nothing be lacking.
004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought
        they to the place where [the officers] were, every man
        according to his charge.
004:029 God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
        and very great understanding, even as the sand that is
        on the seashore.
004:030 Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
        of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite,
        and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
        and his fame was in all the nations round about.
004:032 He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were
        one thousand five.
004:033 He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to
        the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals,
        and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
004:034 There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
005:001 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard
        that they had anointed him king in the room of his father:
        for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
005:002 Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
005:003 You know how that David my father could not build a house
        for the name of Yahweh his God for the wars which were about
        him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles
        of his feet.
005:004 But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side;
        there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
005:005 Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh
        my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, Your son,
        whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build
        the house for my name.
005:006 Now therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
        and my servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you
        hire for your servants according to all that you shall say:
        for you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut
        timber like the Sidonians.
005:007 It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
        that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Yahweh this day,
        who has given to David a wise son over this great people.
005:008 Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard [the message]
        which you have sent to me:  I will do all your desire concerning
        timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea;
        and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you
        shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there,
        and you shall receive them; and you shall accomplish my desire,
        in giving food for my household.
005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir
        according to all his desire.
005:011 Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
        food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil:
        thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
005:012 Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there
        was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made
        a league together.
005:013 King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
        was thirty thousand men.
005:014 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses;
        a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home;
        and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.
005:015 Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty
        thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;
005:016 besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work,
        three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people
        who labored in the work.
005:017 The king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones,
        to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.
005:018 Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites
        did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones
        to build the house.
006:001 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after
        the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
        in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel,
        in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began
        to build the house of Yahweh.
006:002 The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, the length of it
        was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty [cubits],
        and the height of it thirty cubits.
006:003 The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
        the length of it, according to the breadth of the house;
        [and] ten cubits was the breadth of it before the house.
006:004 For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.
006:005 Against the wall of the house he built stories round about,
        against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple
        and of the oracle; and he made side chambers round about.
006:006 The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle
        was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad;
        for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house
        round about, that [the beams] should not have hold in the walls
        of the house.
006:007 The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
        ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor
        any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
006:008 The door for the middle side chambers was in the right side
        of the house:  and they went up by winding stairs into
        the middle [story], and out of the middle into the third.
006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house
        with beams and planks of cedar.
006:010 He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high:
        and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
006:011 The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,
006:012 Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk
        in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my
        commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word
        with you, which I spoke to David your father.
006:013 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
        my people Israel.
006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
006:015 He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar:
        from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling,
        he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered
        the floor of the house with boards of fir.
006:016 He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house
        with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls [of
        the ceiling]: he built [them] for it within, for an oracle,
        even for the most holy place.
006:017 The house, that is, the temple before [the oracle],
        was forty cubits [long].
006:018 There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and
        open flowers:  all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
006:019 He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within,
        to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
006:020 Within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length,
        and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in
        the height of it; and he overlaid it with pure gold:
        and he covered the altar with cedar.
006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold:
        and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle;
        and he overlaid it with gold.
006:022 The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house
        was finished:  also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle
        he overlaid with gold.
006:023 In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood,
        each ten cubits high.
006:024 Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
        the other wing of the cherub:  from the uttermost part of the one
        wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
006:025 The other cherub was ten cubits:  both the cherubim were of one
        measure and one form.
006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it
        of the other cherub.
006:027 He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings
        of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing
        of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
        cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
        another in the midst of the house.
006:028 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
006:029 He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
        figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers,
        inside and outside.
006:030 The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.
006:031 For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood:
        the lintel [and] door posts were a fifth part [of the wall].
006:032 So [he made] two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them
        carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
        them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim,
        and on the palm trees.
006:033 So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts
        of olive wood, out of a fourth part [of the wall];
006:034 and two doors of fir wood:  the two leaves of the one door
        were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
006:035 He carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers;
        and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.
006:036 He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone,
        and a course of cedar beams.
006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid,
        in the month Ziv.
006:038 In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month,
        was the house finished throughout all the parts of it,
        and according to all the fashion of it.  So was he seven
        years in building it.
007:001 Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
        all his house.
007:002 For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it
        was one hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits,
        and the height of it thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars,
        with cedar beams on the pillars.
007:003 It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams,
        that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.
007:004 There were beams in three rows, and window was over against
        window in three ranks.
007:005 All the doors and posts were made square with beams:
        and window was over against window in three ranks.
007:006 He made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits,
        and the breadth of it thirty cubits; and a porch before them;
        and pillars and a threshold before them.
007:007 He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge,
        even the porch of judgment:  and it was covered with cedar
        from floor to floor.
007:008 His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch,
        was of the like work.  He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter
        (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.
007:009 All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone,
        according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside,
        even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside
        to the great court.
007:010 The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
        stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
007:011 Above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure,
        and cedar wood.
007:012 The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone,
        and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house
        of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.
007:013 King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
007:014 He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
        was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with
        wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass.
        He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work.
007:015 For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits
        high apiece:  and a line of twelve cubits compassed either
        of them about.
007:016 He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of
        the pillars:  the height of the one capital was five cubits,
        and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
007:017 There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work,
        for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
        seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
007:018 So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about on
        the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top
        of the pillars:  and so did he for the other capital.
007:019 The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch
        were of lily work, four cubits.
007:020 There were capitals above also on the two pillars,
        close by the belly which was beside the network:
        and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about
        on the other capital.
007:021 He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple:
        and he set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin;
        and he set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.
007:022 On the top of the pillars was lily work:  so was the work
        of the pillars finished.
007:023 He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits;
        and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
007:024 Under the brim of it round about there were buds which did
        compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about:
        the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
007:025 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
        and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward
        the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was
        set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
007:026 It was a handbreadth thick:  and the brim of it was worked
        like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily:
        it held two thousand baths.
007:027 He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length
        of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits
        the height of it.
007:028 The work of the bases was on this manner:  they had panels;
        and there were panels between the ledges;
007:029 and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen,
        and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above;
        and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
007:030 Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass;
        and the four feet of it had supports:  beneath the basin
        were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
007:031 The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit:
        and the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal,
        a cubit and a half; and also on the mouth of it were engravings,
        and their panels were foursquare, not round.
007:032 The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles
        of the wheels were in the base:  and the height of a wheel
        was a cubit and half a cubit.
007:033 The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
        their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves,
        were all molten.
007:034 There were four supports at the four corners of each base:
        the supports of it were of the base itself.
007:035 In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high;
        and on the top of the base the stays of it and the panels
        of it were of the same.
007:036 On the plates of the stays of it, and on the panels of it,
        he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to
        the space of each, with wreaths round about.
007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases:  all of them had
        one casting, one measure, and one form.
007:038 He made ten basins of brass:  one basin contained forty baths;
        and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten
        bases one basin.
007:039 He set the bases, five on the right side of the house,
        and five on the left side of the house:  and he set the sea
        on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
007:040 Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins.
        So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked
        for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh:
007:041 the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on
        the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
007:042 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks;
        two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two
        bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
007:043 and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;
007:044 and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
007:045 and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins:
        even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon,
        in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished brass.
007:046 In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
007:047 Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were
        exceeding many:  the weight of the brass could not be found out.
007:048 Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh:
        the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show
        bread was, of gold;
007:049 and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left,
        before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps,
        and the tongs, of gold;
007:050 and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons,
        and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for
        the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for
        the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple, of gold.
007:051 Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house
        of Yahweh was finished.  Solomon brought in the things
        which David his father had dedicated, [even] the silver,
        and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries
        of the house of Yahweh.
008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' [houses] of the
        children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David,
        which is Zion.
008:002 All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at
        the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
008:003 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
008:004 They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting,
        and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did
        the priests and the Levites bring up.
008:005 King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled
        to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen,
        that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
008:006 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to
        its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,
        even under the wings of the cherubim.
008:007 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles
        of it above.
008:008 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from
        the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside:
        and there they are to this day.
008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone
        which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant
        with the children of Israel, when they came out of the
        land of Egypt.
008:010 It came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place,
        that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,
008:011 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
        the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.
008:012 Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell
        in the thick darkness.
008:013 I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you
        to dwell in forever.
008:014 The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly
        of Israel:  and all the assembly of Israel stood.
008:015 He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke
        with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand
        fulfilled it, saying,
008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out
        of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel
        to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose
        David to be over my people Israel.
008:017 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
        for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
008:018 But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your
        heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it
        was in your heart:
008:019 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who
        shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house
        for my name.
008:020 Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I am risen up
        in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel,
        as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
008:021 There have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant
        of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought
        them out of the land of Egypt.
008:022 Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all
        the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
008:023 and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you,
        in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant
        and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you
        with all their heart;
008:024 who have kept with your servant David my father that which you
        did promise him:  yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have
        fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
008:025 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
        David my father that which you have promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne
        of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way,
        to walk before me as you have walked before me.
008:026 Now therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified,
        which you spoke to your servant David my father.
008:027 But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold,
        heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you;
        how much less this house that I have built!
008:028 Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for
        his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to
        the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;
008:029 that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
        even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall
        be there; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall
        pray toward this place.
008:030 Listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your
        people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place:
        yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when
        you hear, forgive.
008:031 If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him
        to cause him to swear, and he come [and] swear before your
        altar in this house;
008:032 then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants,
        condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head,
        and justifying the righteous, to give him according
        to his righteousness.
008:033 When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you,
        and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you
        in this house:
008:034 then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel,
        and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.
008:035 When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place,
        and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you
        do afflict them:
008:036 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants,
        and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way
        in which they should walk; and send rain on your land,
        which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        if there is blight [or] mildew, locust [or] caterpillar;
        if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities;
        whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;
008:038 whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man,
        [or] by all your people Israel, who shall know every man
        the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands
        toward this house:
008:039 then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive,
        and do, and render to every man according to all his ways,
        whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts
        of all the children of men;)
008:040 that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land
        which you gave to our fathers.
008:041 Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel,
        when he shall come out of a far country for your name's sake
008:042 (for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand,
        and of your outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray
        toward this house;
008:043 hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all
        that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples
        of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as does your
        people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I
        have built is called by my name.
008:044 If your people go out to battle against their enemy,
        by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh
        toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house
        which I have built for your name;
008:045 then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.
008:046 If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin),
        and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy,
        so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy,
        far off or near;
008:047 yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they
        are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication
        to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying,
        We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
008:048 if they return to you with all their heart and with all their
        soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive,
        and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers,
        the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have
        built for your name:
008:049 then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven,
        your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;
008:050 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their
        transgressions in which they have transgressed against you;
        and give them compassion before those who carried them captive,
        that they may have compassion on them
008:051 (for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought
        forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
008:052 that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant,
        and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen
        to them whenever they cry to you.
008:053 For you did separate them from among all the peoples of the earth,
        to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant,
        when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.
008:054 It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
        this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before
        the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands
        spread forth toward heaven.
008:055 He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a
        loud voice, saying,
008:056 Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel,
        according to all that he promised:  there has not failed
        one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
        Moses his servant.
008:057 Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers:
        let him not leave us, nor forsake us;
008:058 that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways,
        and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances,
        which he commanded our fathers.
008:059 Let these my words, with which I have made supplication
        before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night,
        that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause
        of his people Israel, as every day shall require;
008:060 that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God;
        there is none else.
008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God,
        to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments,
        as at this day.
008:062 The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
008:063 Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings,
        which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand oxen,
        and one hundred twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all
        the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.
008:064 The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy
        that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered
        the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat
        of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was
        before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering,
        and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.
008:065 So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him,
        a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook
        of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days,
        even fourteen days.
008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed
        the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart
        for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant,
        and to Israel his people.
009:001 It happened, when Solomon had finished the building of the house
        of Yahweh, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire
        which he was pleased to do,
009:002 that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
        appeared to him at Gibeon.
009:003 Yahweh said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication,
        that you have made before me:  I have made this house holy,
        which you have built, to put my name there forever;
        and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
009:004 As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked,
        in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according
        to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes
        and my ordinances;
009:005 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever,
        according as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall
        not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.
009:006 But if you shall turn away from following me, you or your children,
        and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I
        have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods,
        and worship them;
009:007 then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;
        and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast
        out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword
        among all peoples.
009:008 Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes
        by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say,
        Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
009:009 and they shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God,
        who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
        and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them:
        therefore has Yahweh brought all this evil on them.
009:010 It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had
        built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the king's house
009:011 (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
        trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all
        his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities
        in the land of Galilee.
009:012 Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
        given him; and they didn't please him.
009:013 He said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?
        He called them the land of Cabul to this day.
009:014 Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.
009:015 This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised,
        to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo,
        and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
009:016 Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
        it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city,
        and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
009:017 Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,
009:018 and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
009:019 and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities
        for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that
        which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem,
        and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
009:020 As for all the people who were left of the Amorites,
        the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
        who were not of the children of Israel;
009:021 their children who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy,
        of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants to this day.
009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants;
        but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes,
        and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
009:023 These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work,
        five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored
        in the work.
009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David
        to her house which [Solomon] had built for her:
        then did he build Millo.
009:025 Three times a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
        and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh,
        burning incense therewith, [on the altar] that was before Yahweh.
        So he finished the house.
009:026 King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is
        beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        in the land of Edom.
009:027 Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge
        of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
009:028 They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred
        and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
010:001 When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
        the name of Yahweh, she came to prove him with hard questions.
010:002 She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
        that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones;
        and when she was come to Solomon, she talked with him of all
        that was in her heart.
010:003 Solomon told her all her questions:  there was not anything
        hidden from the king which he didn't tell her.
010:004 When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,
010:005 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing,
        and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up
        to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.
010:006 She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my
        own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.
010:007 However I didn't believe the words, until I came, and my
        eyes had seen it:  and behold, the half was not told me;
        your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
010:008 Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand
        continually before you, [and] who hear your wisdom.
010:009 Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you
        on the throne of Israel:  because Yahweh loved Israel forever,
        therefore made he you king, to do justice and righteousness.
010:010 She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices very great store, and precious stones:
        there came no more such abundance of spices as these which
        the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
010:011 The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
        from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.
010:012 The king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh,
        and for the king's house, harps also and stringed instruments
        for the singers:  there came no such almug trees, nor were seen,
        to this day.
010:013 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of
        his royal bounty.  So she turned, and went to her own land,
        she and her servants.
010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
        hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
010:015 besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic
        of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people,
        and of the governors of the country.
010:016 King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold;
        six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.
010:017 [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas
        of gold went to one shield:  and the king put them in the house
        of the forest of Lebanon.
010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with the finest gold.
010:019 There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was
        round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place
        of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
010:020 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on
        the six steps:  there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.
010:021 All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
        of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold:
        none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the
        days of Solomon.
010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram:
        once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold,
        and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches
        and in wisdom.
010:024 All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom,
        which God had put in his heart.
010:025 They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels
        of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules,
        a rate year by year.
010:026 Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen:
        and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve
        thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities,
        and with the king at Jerusalem.
010:027 The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,
        and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are
        in the lowland, for abundance.
010:028 The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt;
        and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove
        at a price.
010:029 A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
        [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty;
        and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings
        of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
011:001 Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter
        of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians,
        and Hittites;
011:002 of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children
        of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they
        come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart
        after their gods:  Solomon joined to these in love.
011:003 He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines;
        and his wives turned away his heart.
011:004 For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
        away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect
        with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.
011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians,
        and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
011:006 Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
        and didn't go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.
011:007 Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination
        of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for
        Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
011:008 So did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and
        sacrificed to their gods.
011:009 Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away
        from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
011:010 and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
        after other gods:  but he didn't keep that which Yahweh commanded.
011:011 Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you,
        and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I
        have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you,
        and will give it to your servant.
011:012 Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David
        your father's sake:  but I will tear it out of the hand
        of your son.
011:013 However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will
        give one tribe to your son, for David my servant's sake,
        and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
011:014 Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
        he was of the king's seed in Edom.
011:015 For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain
        of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck
        every male in Edom
011:016 (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had
        cut off every male in Edom);
011:017 that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
        with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
011:018 They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men
        with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh
        king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food,
        and gave him land.
011:019 Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
        he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister
        of Tahpenes the queen.
011:020 The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
        weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's
        house among the sons of Pharaoh.
011:021 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
        and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said
        to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
011:022 Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me,
        that behold, you seek to go to your own country?
        He answered, Nothing:  however only let me depart.
011:023 God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada,
        who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
011:024 He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop,
        when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus,
        and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.
011:025 He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
        besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel,
        and reigned over Syria.
011:026 Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah,
        a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow,
        he also lifted up his hand against the king.
011:027 This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king:
        Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city
        of David his father.
011:028 The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw
        the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge
        over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
011:029 It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
        that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
        now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they
        two were alone in the field.
011:030 Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore
        it in twelve pieces.
011:031 He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of
        the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you
011:032 (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake
        and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out
        of all the tribes of Israel);
011:033 because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped
        Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god
        of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon;
        and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right
        in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances,
        as did David his father.
011:034 However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand;
        but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David
        my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments
        and my statutes;
011:035 but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
        give it to you, even ten tribes.
011:036 To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
        have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I
        have chosen me to put my name there.
011:037 I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your
        soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.
011:038 It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you,
        and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes,
        to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did;
        that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house,
        as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.
011:039 I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.
011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose,
        and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt
        until the death of Solomon.
011:041 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,
        and his wisdom, aren't they written in the book of the
        acts of Solomon?
011:042 The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
        was forty years.
011:043 Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
        of David his father:  and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
012:001 Rehoboam went to Shechem:  for all Israel were come to Shechem
        to make him king.
012:002 It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it
        (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence
        of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,
012:003 and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly
        of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
012:004 Your father made our yoke grievous:  now therefore make you
        the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke
        which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
012:005 He said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.
        The people departed.
012:006 King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before
        Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel
        give you me to return answer to this people?
012:007 They spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this
        people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak
        good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.
012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
        and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him,
        who stood before him.
012:009 He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer
        to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        that your father did put on us lighter?
012:010 The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying,
        Thus shall you tell this people who spoke to you, saying,
        Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us;
        thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker
        than my father's waist.
012:011 Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
        I will add to your yoke:  my father chastised you with whips,
        but I will chastise you with scorpions.
012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
012:013 The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel
        of the old men which they had given him,
012:014 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke:
        my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
        you with scorpions.
012:015 So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was a thing
        brought about of Yahweh, that he might establish his word,
        which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat.
012:016 When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we
        in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        to your tents, Israel:  now see to your own house, David.
        So Israel departed to their tents.
012:017 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities
        of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject
        to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones.
        King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot,
        to flee to Jerusalem.
012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
012:020 It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned,
        that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him
        king over all Israel:  there was none who followed the house
        of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
012:021 When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
        of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty
        thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against
        the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon.
012:022 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
012:023 Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
        and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest
        of the people, saying,
012:024 Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your
        brothers the children of Israel:  return every man to his house;
        for this thing is of me.  So they listened to the word of Yahweh,
        and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.
012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim,
        and lived therein; and he went out from there, and built Penuel.
012:026 Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return
        to the house of David:
012:027 if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house
        of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people
        turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah;
        and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold;
        and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
        see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the
        land of Egypt.
012:029 He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
012:030 This thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship]
        before the one, even to Dan.
012:031 He made houses of high places, and made priests from among
        all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
012:032 Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
        day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went
        up to the altar; so did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves
        that he had made:  and he placed in Bethel the priests
        of the high places that he had made.
012:033 He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on
        the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month
        which he had devised of his own heart:  and he ordained
        a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar,
        to burn incense.
013:001 Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
        of Yahweh to Beth El:  and Jeroboam was standing by the altar
        to burn incense.
013:002 He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said,
        altar, altar, thus says Yahweh:  Behold, a son shall be born
        to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall
        he sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense
        on you, and men's bones shall they burn on you.
013:003 He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
        which Yahweh has spoken:  Behold, the altar shall be torn,
        and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.
013:004 It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God,
        which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam
        put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.
        His hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
        so that he could not draw it back again to him.
013:005 The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
        according to the sign which the man of God had given by
        the word of Yahweh.
013:006 The king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh
        your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.
        The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king's hand was
        restored him again, and became as it was before.
013:007 The king said to the man of God, Come home with me,
        and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
013:008 The man of God said to the king, If you will give me half
        your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat
        bread nor drink water in this place;
013:009 for so was it charged me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall
        eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way
        that you came.
013:010 So he went another way, and didn't return by the way that
        he came to Bethel.
013:011 Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons
        came and told him all the works that the man of God had done
        that day in Bethel:  the words which he had spoken to the king,
        them also they told to their father.
013:012 Their father said to them, Which way did he go?
        Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went,
        who came from Judah.
013:013 He said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey.  So they saddled
        him the donkey; and he rode thereon.
013:014 He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak;
        and he said to him, Are you the man of God who came
        from Judah?  He said, I am.
013:015 Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
013:016 He said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you;
        neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
013:017 for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no
        bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way
        that you came.
013:018 He said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel
        spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Bring him back with
        you into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.
        [But] he lied to him.
013:019 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house,
        and drank water.
013:020 It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh
        came to the prophet who brought him back;
013:021 and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying,
        Thus says Yahweh, Because you have been disobedient to the mouth
        of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh
        your God commanded you,
013:022 but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place
        of which he said to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water;
        your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.
013:023 It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk,
        that he saddled for him the donkey, [to wit], for the prophet
        whom he had brought back.
013:024 When he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him:
        and his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it;
        the lion also stood by the body.
013:025 Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way,
        and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it
        in the city where the old prophet lived.
013:026 When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it,
        he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the mouth
        of Yahweh:  therefore Yahweh has delivered him to the lion,
        which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke to him.
013:027 He spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey.
        They saddled it.
013:028 He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey
        and the lion standing by the body:  the lion had not eaten
        the body, nor torn the donkey.
013:029 The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it
        on the donkey, and brought it back; and he came to the city
        of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
013:030 He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
        [saying], Alas, my brother!
013:031 It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons,
        saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which
        the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against
        the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
        places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely happen.
013:033 After this thing Jeroboam didn't return from his evil way, but made
        again from among all the people priests of the high places:
        whoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests
        of the high places.
013:034 This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off,
        and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.
014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
014:002 Jeroboam said to his wife, Please get up and disguise yourself,
        that you not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you
        to Shiloh:  behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke
        concerning me that I should be king over this people.
014:003 Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey,
        and go to him:  he will tell you what shall become of the child.
014:004 Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh,
        and came to the house of Ahijah.  Now Ahijah could not see;
        for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
014:005 Yahweh said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes
        to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick:
        thus and thus shall you tell her; for it will be, when she
        comes in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
014:006 It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
        in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam;
        why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you
        with heavy news.
014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Because I
        exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over
        my people Israel,
014:008 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you;
        and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept
        my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart,
        to do that only which was right in my eyes,
014:009 but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone
        and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me
        to anger, and have cast me behind your back:
014:010 therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam,
        and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall,{or,
        male} him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel,
        and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man
        sweeps away dung, until it be all gone.
014:011 Him who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat;
        and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat:
        for Yahweh has spoken it.
014:012 Arise you therefore, get you to your house:  [and] when your
        feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
014:013 All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only
        of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there
        is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in the house of Jeroboam.
014:014 Moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel,
        who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day:
        but what? even now.
014:015 For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water;
        and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave
        to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,
        because they have made their Asherim, provoking Yahweh to anger.
014:016 He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
        which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.
014:017 Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
        [and] as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
014:018 All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
014:019 The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
        he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel.
014:020 The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
        and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned
        in his place.
014:021 Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was
        forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
        seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen
        out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there:
        and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
014:022 Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they
        provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed,
        above all that their fathers had done.
014:023 For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim,
        on every high hill, and under every green tree;
014:024 and there were also sodomites in the land:  they did according
        to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove
        out before the children of Israel.
014:025 It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
        king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
014:026 and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
        and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all:
        and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
014:027 King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
        and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard,
        who kept the door of the king's house.
014:028 It was so, that as often as the king went into the house
        of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into
        the guard chamber.
014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Judah?
014:030 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
014:031 Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
        the city of David:  and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
        Abijam his son reigned in his place.
015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
        began Abijam to reign over Judah.
015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's name
        was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
015:003 He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
        before him; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God,
        as the heart of David his father.
015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did Yahweh his God give
        him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him,
        and to establish Jerusalem;
015:005 because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,
        and didn't turn aside from anything that he commanded
        him all the days of his life, except only in the matter
        of Uriah the Hittite.
015:006 Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
        of his life.
015:007 The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Judah?  There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
015:008 Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city
        of David:  and Asa his son reigned in his place.
015:009 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa
        to reign over Judah.
015:010 Forty-one years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
        name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
015:011 Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did
        David his father.
015:012 He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
        the idols that his fathers had made.
015:013 Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen,
        because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah;
        and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
015:014 But the high places were not taken away:  nevertheless the heart
        of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all his days.
015:015 He brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father
        had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated,
        silver, and gold, and vessels.
015:016 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
015:017 Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
        that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa
        king of Judah.
015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left
        in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures
        of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand
        of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad,
        the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria,
        who lived at Damascus, saying,
015:019 [There is] a league between me and you, between my father and
        your father:  behold, I have sent to you a present of silver
        and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel,
        that he may depart from me.
015:020 Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of
        his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all
        the land of Naphtali.
015:021 It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off
        building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.
015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted:
        and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it,
        with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith
        Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
015:023 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might,
        and all that he did, and the cities which he built,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Judah?  But in the time of his old age he was diseased
        in his feet.
015:024 Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
        in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son
        reigned in his place.
015:025 Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
        year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
015:026 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made
        Israel to sin.
015:027 Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
        conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon,
        which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
        were laying siege to Gibbethon.
015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha kill him,
        and reigned in his place.
015:029 It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house
        of Jeroboam:  he didn't leave to Jeroboam any who breathed,
        until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of Yahweh,
        which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
015:030 for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which
        he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which
        he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.
015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?
015:032 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha
        the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah,
        [and reigned] twenty-four years.
015:034 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
        in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made
        Israel to sin.
016:001 The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani
        against Baasha, saying,
016:002 Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over
        my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam,
        and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger
        with their sins;
016:003 behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house;
        and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat.
016:004 Him who dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat;
        and him who dies of his in the field shall the birds of
        the sky eat.
016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did,
        and his might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
016:006 Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah;
        and Elah his son reigned in his place.
016:007 Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
        the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his house,
        both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh,
        to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being
        like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.
016:008 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah began
        Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah,
        [and reigned] two years.
016:009 His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
        against him.  Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk
        in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
016:010 and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him,
        in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned
        in his place.
016:011 It happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
        on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha:
        he didn't leave him a single one who urinates on a wall,{or,
        male} neither of his relatives, nor of his friends.
016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word
        of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
016:013 for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son,
        which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin,
        to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren't they
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
016:015 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
        reign seven days in Tirzah.  Now the people were encamped
        against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
016:016 The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired,
        and has also struck the king:  therefore all Israel made Omri,
        the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
016:017 Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him,
        and they besieged Tirzah.
016:018 It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
        that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt
        the king's house over him with fire, and died,
016:019 for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam,
        and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he did,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?
016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts:
        half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make
        him king; and half followed Omri.
016:022 But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people
        who followed Tibni the son of Ginath:  so Tibni died,
        and Omri reigned.
016:023 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
        to reign over Israel, [and reigned] twelve years:
        six years reigned he in Tirzah.
016:024 He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver;
        and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city
        which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of
        the hill, Samaria.
016:025 Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt
        wickedly above all who were before him.
016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
        that he shown, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?
016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria;
        and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
016:029 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab
        the son of Omri to reign over Israel:  and Ahab the son
        of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
016:030 Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh above all that were before him.
016:031 It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
        in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife
        Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians,
        and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
016:032 He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
        which he had built in Samaria.
016:033 Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel
        who were before him.
016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho:  he laid
        the foundation of it with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,
        and set up the gates of it with the loss of his youngest
        son Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke
        by Joshua the son of Nun.
017:001 Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead,
        said to Ahab, As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom
        I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years,
        but according to my word.
017:002 The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
017:003 Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself
        by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
017:004 It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have
        commanded the ravens to feed you there.
017:005 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went
        and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
017:006 The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
        and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
017:007 It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there
        was no rain in the land.
017:008 The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
017:009 Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon,
        and dwell there:  behold, I have commanded a widow there
        to sustain you.
017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate
        of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks:
        and he called to her, and said, Please get me a little water
        in a vessel, that I may drink.
017:011 As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said,
        Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
017:012 She said, As Yahweh your God lives, I don't have a cake,
        but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar:
        and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake
        it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
017:013 Elijah said to her, Don't be afraid; go and do as you have said;
        but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it forth to me,
        and afterward make for you and for your son.
017:014 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall
        not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day
        that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.
017:015 She went and did according to the saying of Elijah:
        and she, and he, and her house, ate [many] days.
017:016 The jar of meal didn't empty, neither did the jar of oil fail,
        according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah.
017:017 It happened after these things, that the son of the woman,
        the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was
        so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
017:018 She said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, you man
        of God?  You have come to me to bring my sin to memory,
        and to kill my son!
017:019 He said to her, Give me your son.  He took him out of her bosom,
        and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode,
        and laid him on his own bed.
017:020 He cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, have you also brought
        evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?
017:021 He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh,
        and said, Yahweh my God, please let this child's soul come
        into him again.
017:022 Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child
        came into him again, and he revived.
017:023 Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
        chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother;
        and Elijah said, Behold, your son lives.
017:024 The woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God,
        and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.
018:001 It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came
        to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab;
        and I will send rain on the earth.
018:002 Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.  The famine was
        sore in Samaria.
018:003 Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.
        (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:
018:004 for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh,
        that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
        in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
018:005 Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs
        of water, and to all the brooks:  peradventure we may find
        grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose
        all the animals.
018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
        Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another
        way by himself.
018:007 As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him:
        and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you,
        my lord Elijah?
018:008 He answered him, It is I:  go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is
        here].
018:009 He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your
        servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
018:010 As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom,
        where my lord has not sent to seek you:  and when they said,
        He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation,
        that they didn't find you.
018:011 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].
018:012 It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit
        of Yahweh will carry you I don't know where; and so when I
        come and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he will kill me:
        but I your servant fear Yahweh from my youth.
018:013 Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets
        of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh's prophets
        by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
018:014 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here];
        and he will kill me.
018:015 Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
        I will surely show myself to him today.
018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went
        to meet Elijah.
018:017 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,
        Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
018:018 He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your
        father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments
        of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel,
        and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets
        of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
018:020 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered
        the prophets together to Mount Carmel.
018:021 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you
        waver between the two sides?  If Yahweh is God, follow him;
        but if Baal, then follow him."  The people answered him
        not a word.
018:022 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet
        of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men.
018:023 Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose ectronic works that could be

ot one of the scheduled planes. Besides,
we'd see the red and green navigation lights."

On impulse Dave reached out his hand and switched off all of his own
lights, save the wing-tip navigation lights. Then all three of them
stared hard off to the right. For a full two minutes nobody spoke. The
three of them simply strained their eyes at the vast array of night
shadows in the heavens. But all that it got them was aching eyes.

"Nothing there evidently," Colonel Welsh eventually broke the silence.
"Perhaps it was just a falling star, but I never saw a star fall _up_."

"Maybe it was some of that Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said with a
chuckle. "I never heard of it being seen in this part of the country,
though."

"Saint _what_?" Freddy Farmer echoed. "What in the world are you
talking about? And what is it?"

"Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said. "Didn't you ever hear of it, Freddy?"

"Would I be asking, if I had?" the English youth snapped. "Go on. Stop
waiting to be encouraged to show all your knowledge. Just what is Saint
Elmo's Fire?"

"Well, I can't give you a scientific answer to that one," Dave said.
"But Saint Elmo's Fire is the name given to globular electric light
often seen on the spars and rigging of ships at sea during a storm.
And of recent years it has been seen on the wing tips of airplanes
flying through electrically charged air. Frankly, I've never seen any
of the stuff in my life. But I knew a pilot once who used to fly over
the Andes in South America, and he said they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed to roll right along the leading
edges of the wing, and then disappear just when you thought they were
going to bump into the gas tanks, or something. The first few times he
witnessed such a display he lost a dozen years off his life. He said,
though, that after a while he got used to it--even looked forward to
it every time he took off."

"You're pulling my leg!" Freddy snorted.

"No, Farmer, that's true," Colonel Welsh said. "I've seen some Saint
Elmo's Fire myself. And I can tell you that it scares the pants off you
the first time you see it. Ever fly through a thunder storm, and see
lightning playing around your wing tips?"

"Yes, I've seen that," Freddy admitted. "And I was sure I'd never live
to land safely on the ground again."

"Well, then, you know how it feels to see Saint Elmo's Fire," the
Colonel chuckled. "Only I think the Saint Elmo stuff gives you a worse
scare when you see it actually come rolling along the wing toward you.
But that light I saw just now wasn't shaped like a ball. More like a
streak, or like the powdered tail of a comet. It was strung out in a--"

If Colonel Welsh finished the sentence, nobody heard it. At that moment
the night skies shook and trembled with the savage yammer of aerial
machine gun fire. And the cabin window not eighteen inches in front of
Dave's eyes seemed to crack in a trillion places and then melt away
into oblivion.

"My word!" Colonel Welsh cried. "What was that?"

Dave didn't bother to answer for a second or so. His heart had zoomed
up his throat to jam hard against his back teeth, and his eyes had
bulged out of their sockets like marbles on sticks. Instinct took split
second charge of his movements, however, and almost before he realized
what he was doing he had booted the Lockheed up over on left wing tip
and was slicing down through the air. At practically the same instant
he whipped out his free hand and switched off the navigation lights.
Then as the craft went slicing down through the night sky, he dragged
air into his aching lungs.

"Those were aerial machine guns!" he cried. "And whoever was working
them was in earnest. Look at that window! Just a shade improvement on
his aim and it would have been curtains for the three of us."

As the last left Dave's lips, he pulled the plane out of its wild
sideslip and went curving up and around to the left.

"Aerial machine guns?" Colonel Welsh echoed in blank amazement. "You're
crazy, Dawson!"

"Could be, and maybe!" Dave snapped. "But I've heard those sky
choppers often enough to recognize them every time. And do you think an
eagle or something flew into that window, sir?"

"No, of course not," the Intelligence chief grunted. "Sorry I sounded
off. You're right, of course. But it doesn't make sense. Who the devil
would want to take a crack at us?"

Dave shrugged in the darkness, and for a moment or so as the plane
roared heavenward he strained his eyes for a glimpse of some other
shadow cutting about in the air. He saw nothing, however, and then
turned his head and spoke back over his shoulder.

"Maybe not _us_, sir," he said, "but I guess the Axis would be pretty
tickled to see _you_ put out of circulation. If you want my guess, some
rat saw you take off with us. Maybe he used a hidden radio and sent
word ahead. This mountainous country is a swell place to hide a plane,
you know, sir."

"And those _were_ exhaust plumes you saw!" Freddy Farmer cried. "The
lad was probably climbing up to get around in back when you saw his
exhaust plumes. Well, let the beggar come again. We'll--Good grief!
This plane isn't armed!"

"No," Colonel Welsh said in a slightly hollow voice. "Guess they never
figured it was necessary to arm these utility planes used to transport
personnel about the country."

"If only the chaps in high places would stop _figuring_ so much in this
war!" Dave groaned.

"Quite!" Freddy Farmer echoed the truth bitterly. "But bemoaning the
lack of common sense in the average High Command won't help us now. If
the blighter comes back for another fling, Dave, you'll just have to--"

"Don't bother telling me!" Dave shouted. "Here he comes--from the left
and up! Hang onto your seats!"

The last had hardly left Dave's lips before he was hauling the Lockheed
straight up on its tail. Before the plane reached stalling speed,
however, he kicked it over on wing and then sent it dropping nose first
toward the black carpet below that was the ground. No sooner had he
kicked the plane over on wing than he switched off both engines, and
shoved the compensator throttle open wide, so that no carbon sparks or
exhaust light of any kind would etch their path downward through the
night.

Meanwhile the mysterious attacker had opened fire again, but Dave's
quick action at the controls caused the unknown killer to miss by a
wide margin. The flickering ribbon of tracers didn't even come close.
And at the end of another three or four seconds the Lockheed was well
on its way earthward and out of sight.

"See that bird as he banged on by us?" Dave cried, when he was able to
talk again. "It looked to me like a small Beechcraft. Or maybe it was a
Waco. But he's carrying two guns--and he wants us mighty badly. Heck,
if there were only guns aboard this crate. I had a beautiful broadside
bead on him."

"Yes, I saw his silhouette as he tore by," Freddy said through clenched
teeth. "But I didn't recognize his type. I don't know the Yank planes
very well, though. But I say, Dave! Watch our altitude, you know!"

"You're telling me!" Dave grunted. "I'm watching it plenty, and
praying, too. There must be some of those mountains under us by now.
I think we've got a couple of thousand feet to play around in, but no
more than that. I'm flat gliding her as much as I can, but keep those
eagle X-ray eyes of yours on the job, Freddy. And yell if you see a
mountain peak looming up."

"Mountain peak!" Colonel Welsh cried excitedly. "For pity's sake, keep
above them, Dawson. Start those engines and get us some altitude!"

"That would be risking more than this glide, sir," Dave told him.
"That bird up there has been spotting us by our exhaust plumes, and
aiming blindly. So long as we show no light at all he stands to lose us
completely. But if we open up the engines and show exhaust light he's
going to be able to take another crack. And--well, third time never
fails, you know, and stuff. Our best bet is to try and lose him before
we get too low. He has a ship that can travel, but if we get a little
lead on him we'll be all right."

"But remember all those mountain peaks down there!" the Intelligence
chief persisted. "One thing this plane has got is parachutes. Perhaps
we'd better bail out and let the blasted ship crash. At least we'd save
our own necks."

"Not me!" Dave barked without thinking. "Go ahead and bail out if
you want to. You, too, Freddy. But I'm sticking with this ship if
I possibly can. I don't want to see her bust up, if I can help it.
Anyway, I'm going to give her all the breaks she's got coming."

"And of course I'm staying with you," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "I'm
a blasted fool to put my precious neck in your hands. But there you
are, anyway."

"No wonder you two are famous for pulling miracles out of a hat!"
Colonel Welsh growled. Then after a short pause: "Very well! If Farmer
trusts you that much, I suppose I might as well. But if you have to hit
a mountain, for pity's sake try and pick out a soft one. I bruise very
easily!"




CHAPTER SEVEN

_Pilot's Luck_


Dave chuckled as the Colonel's remark came to his ears, but his heart
pounded a little harder and the warm glow of pride rippled through his
veins.

"Thanks, sir," he said. "And sorry that I exploded that way. But don't
worry, I'll get us out of this little jam if it's the last thing I do."

"Well, see that it _isn't_, my good man!" Freddy Farmer grunted.

For the next few moments nobody said a word. All three of them leaned
forward in their seats and strained their eyes at the darkness ahead
and below. Dave's hands felt cold and clammy, and he could feel the
little drops of sweat ooze out on his forehead and trickle down his
face. For the last fifteen seconds or so he had spotted what he
believed to be a mountain peak just ahead, and not more than a hundred
feet below. He didn't say a word to the others. He kept his mouth shut
and eased the plane a little to the left so as to be able to pass on
by the peak with enough free air to spare between his right wing tip
and the unseen trees or jagged rocks he knew must dot all sides of
that peak. Once past it, he could start the engines again and climb
for altitude. It was a cinch that the unknown attacker was cutting
about in the black sky somewhere far behind him. But once he got beyond
that peak he felt that his lead would be great enough for him to risk
showing his exhaust plumes. As a matter of fact, though, it was quite
possible that the unknown attacker was miles and miles behind. It was
possible that the man had cut around to the east, believing that Dave
wouldn't dare chance holding his westerly course with the mountains so
close.

"Yeah, maybe!" he murmured. "But I'm going to make sure just the same!"

"What did you say, Dave?" Freddy Farmer cried out in a voice of alarm.

"I didn't say a thing," Dave grunted, and tightened his hold on the
controls. "Just thinking a little out loud. Shut up, little man, or
you'll make me rock the boat."

Freddy Farmer caught his breath as though he were about to speak.
Instead, though, he said nothing. He simply leaned farther forward
in his seat. Dave caught the movement out the corner of his eye,
and grinned, tight-lipped. Freddy had sighted the mountain peak, but
realized that he had seen it and was trying to slide by on the left. So
the English youth had snapped his lips shut so as not to give Colonel
Welsh a slight case of heart failure. Good old Freddy. Always knew when
to open his mouth, and when to keep mum.

Perhaps it was six seconds, but it seemed like six thousand years to
Dave before the slightly darker shadow that was the mountain peak slid
past the tip of the right wing and disappeared behind. The instant it
was gone from view he whipped on the switches, caught both engines,
and fed them high test gas at full throttle. The roar of the engines
breaking into life was a sound akin to worlds crashing into each other.
Yet at the same time it was a welcome sound to Dave's ears, and to
Freddy Farmer's too. But what filled their hearts with an even greater
happiness was the Lockheed climbing upward to a safe altitude above the
mountain range. The instant he was well clear, Dave swung the plane
onto its westerly course again, and relaxed in the seat.

"Top-hole, Dave," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "A very pukka bit of
flying, that."

"Thanks," Dave replied. "We got away with it okay. But I'd hate like
heck to have to do it every day. You spotted that mountain peak, didn't
you?"

"Quite," the English youth murmured. "But I thought it best to keep my
mouth shut. Realized that you knew what you were doing. And besides, no
sense in--"

"No sense in giving this old dodo grey hairs, eh?" Colonel Welsh spoke
up with a chuckle. "Well, it was nice of both of you, but I saw it,
too. The only reason _I_ didn't speak, though, was because my tongue
was frozen stiff. As you say, Dawson, I'd hate to have that sort of
thing for a daily diet. Very sweet flying, though, very sweet."

"We could have made it sweeter if this plane had been armed," Dave
grunted, and stared at the black sky ahead. "That tramp certainly had
his nerve jumping on us. Wonder who the heck he could be. Sure you
haven't any ideas, Colonel?"

There was a long minute of silence while the senior officer seemed to
make up his mind.

"No, I'm afraid I haven't," he finally said slowly. "As you mentioned
awhile back, there are probably plenty of birds who would like to see
me out of the way. Somehow, though, I can't see them going about it in
this manner. Their style is more along the line of pot shots from dark
doorways. Or a bomb in my car, or tossed through my window. Frankly, I
can't make head nor tail of this business tonight."

"Many chaps know you were headed west, sir?" Freddy Farmer asked
quietly.

"What do you mean, many?" the Colonel replied sharply. "Did I broadcast
it, you mean?"

"Hardly that, sir," Freddy chuckled. "I mean, did you tell many people
that you were making this trip? Not that any of them are in the pay
of Tokio or Berlin, sir, but it's possible that one of them might
innocently enough mention the fact to somebody who was. You understand
what I mean, sir?"

There was another moment of silence while the chief of U. S.
Intelligence thought things over.

"I see what you mean, Farmer," he grunted presently. "No, I didn't tell
anybody who didn't have the right to know. Fact is, the only ones I
told were those three officers you met in my office. And if those three
aren't one hundred per cent Americans, then I'm Adolf Hitler in the
flesh."

"What about the other end?" Dawson asked.

"What other end?"

"San Diego," Dave said. "Is your man in charge there expecting you? Or
are you just dropping in on a surprise visit?"

"No wonder you chaps always come out on top," Colonel Welsh said in a
frank tone. "Once you get your teeth in something you keep at it until
there's nothing left. Yes, I did wire my head agent in San Diego that I
was coming west tonight. And--"

"And my first month's pay as a U. S. Naval Aviation Lieutenant says
somebody read that wire!" Dawson cut in quickly.

"Hold it!" Colonel Welsh cried, and laughed shortly. "You're flying one
wing low this time. I said in the wire that I was coming out, but I
didn't say _how_, or _what_ time I'd arrive. Afraid you're off on the
wrong scent there, Dawson."

"Maybe, maybe not," Dave said doggedly. "But that chap didn't have a
crack at us tonight just for gunnery practice. He was shooting for
keeps. He knew darn well who was in this plane--and he was out to get
us. He--"

Dave didn't finish. At that moment the right outboard engine of the
Lockheed lost revs fast and began to sputter and clatter. Dave snapped
his eyes at the dash dials, and sucked in his breath sharply as he saw
the oil pressure needle sliding around the face of the dial toward
the zero peg. However, even as he glanced at the needle, it stopped
swinging back and promptly climbed upward again. The engine stopped
sputtering and clattering, and once again sang its full throated song
of power.

The tiny lump of ice remained in Dave's chest, however. He glanced
sidewise at Freddy Farmer and saw the corners of the English youth's
mouth tighten a bit.

"What the devil was that?" Colonel Welsh demanded in a sharp tone.
"Something wrong with the engine?"

"Not now," Dave said with an easiness he didn't feel. "Guess it picked
up a bit of ice but got rid of it in time. Anyway, she's back where
she should be. As I was saying, that lad tonight was out for blood. So
it must follow that somebody knew where you were going, when, and how.
Don't you think so, sir?"

Dave spoke the words, but it was really just an effort to keep the
conversation going. The lump of ice in his chest was hurting him
again, and he was feeling far from calm and collected. The way the
oil pressure of the right outboard engine had dropped told him that
there was trouble ahead. Many people claim that the carburetor is the
heart of an engine, and probably it is, if you want to look at it that
way. However, countless hours in the air had proved to Dave that your
real danger signal is when oil pressure starts dancing around. Engines
can run, often for a long, long time, when the carburetor is out of
whack and the engine is getting a bad feed. But let oil pressure go
screwy and you'll have real trouble on your hands. There are no halfway
measures about oil. It has to be right or your engine is worth no more
than its weight in junk. Gasoline is food for an engine, but oil is its
life blood. If it hasn't got the proper amount it dies, but definitely!

And so Dave spoke the words just to keep the conversation going and
fixed his eyes on the instruments pertaining to the functioning of the
right outboard engine. He hoped and prayed that the skipping had simply
been just one of those things. But in his heart there was gnawing
fear and dread. He feared that bullets from the guns of that unknown
attacker had nicked one of the oil feed lines, and that continued
vibration of the engine was slowly but surely shaking the feed line
connection loose, or at least causing it to crack and buckle slowly, so
that eventually the pressure set up in the line would be reduced to nil.

If it had been daylight, or if he had been sure of the terrain below,
he would have landed and made sure what had happened. But a landing was
too great a risk right now. His best bet was to keep going, nursing the
right outboard engine as much as he could, and hoping and praying that
it would continue to tick over and produce power.

"Yes, I guess your reasoning is sound enough," he heard the Colonel
say. "It's rather hard to believe, though. I mean, why go about it in
such a--well, in such a story book thriller style, you might say? I'm
not going to San Diego on any vital mission. Fact is, I could make this
trip tonight or next week, and it wouldn't make much difference. That's
what makes it seem so--so utterly crazy."

There was a moment of silence, and then Dave laughed a trifle
flat-toned.

"I don't mean to be conceited," he said. "But what you've just said,
sir, doesn't make me feel so good. Or maybe it should make me feel
important as heck. How about you, Freddy? Catch on?"

"I think so," the English youth replied. "But it's a bit--er,
fantastic, you know. However, I would feel a bit better if we had been
able to shoot the beggar down. Always did say night attacks weren't
quite the sporting thing, you know."

"Not the sporting thing, huh?" Dave echoed with a snort. "Pal, that's
only putting it by half. In my book they're plain murder."

"Of course, I'm only the passenger," Colonel Welsh spoke up sharply.
"So don't mind me. However, I would like very much to know what the
devil you two are jabbering about. What's it all about, anyway?"

"You tell him, Freddy," Dave said. "I--I feel too modest."

"Rubbish!" the English youth snapped. "You couldn't be if you tried.
Besides, you brought it up."

"Listen, you lads!" the chief of U. S. Intelligence boomed in
exasperation. "Have I got to use my authority as a Colonel? What in
blue blazes are you two talking about?"

"The fantastic, sir," Dave said with a chuckle. "Yet, on the other
hand, possibly the truth. Maybe the pilot of that plane didn't want
_Farmer and me to go aboard the Carrier Indian_."

Colonel Welsh made a hissing sound as he sucked in his breath sharply.

"Great guns!" he gasped. And then in the same breath: "But that _is_
impossible. Not even my three closest assistants knew that was to
happen until I informed you. And we went from my office straight to
Alexandria Field. No, you must be wrong, Dawson. Captains Lamb and
Stacey, and Lieutenant Caldwell, wouldn't breath a word of that even
though a gun were held at their hearts. That _is_ fantastic!"

The two boys looked crestfallen.

"See, Freddy?" Dave cried, and jabbed an elbow in his pal's ribs. "You
get the screwiest ideas. I never--!"

"None of that, funny boy!" the English youth barked back at him. "No,
you don't, not by a jugful. You brought it up. I simply agreed with
you, to be polite. You're quite right, Colonel. It's ridiculous. But
when you get to know Dawson better, you'll understand how he's--"

The rest of what Freddy Farmer would have said to the Colonel stuck
fast when only halfway up his throat. The right outboard engine
had started kicking up again, but this time it was really doing it
in earnest. The oil pressure needle went around to the zero peg in
a single jump. And even as Dave grabbed for the throttle, the right
outboard engine let out a grinding scream as though it were actually
something human, and in mortal pain. It had run dry and was seizing
up. Almost at the same instant, and as though in sympathy for its
mechanical brother, the left outboard engine started falling off in
revs at an alarming rate. Dave killed the right engine completely,
shoved hard on the left rudder to check the plane yawing, and
concentrated on keeping the left outboard engines alive as long as
possible.

"That tears it!" he said between clenched teeth. "I was afraid that
right engine had been nicked. Getting ready to drop a couple of those
landing flares, Freddy. At least we can take a look at what it's like
below."

"Take a look?" Colonel Welsh cried sharply. "You don't have to, boy!
There are mountains down there. Get us as high as you can, and then
we'll all bail out."

A hot wave of anger swept through Dawson, but he was able to choke the
words back in time. Instead he turned to Freddy Farmer and nodded.

"Let a couple go, Freddy," he said quietly. "We're only losing a foot
or two of altitude. We'll take a look _first_!"




CHAPTER EIGHT

_Nobody's Airport_


Freddy Farmer didn't bother acknowledging the request by word of mouth.
He simply nodded, and reached out his hand and jerked the little handle
that released landing flares fitted into the wing tips. There were a
few seconds more of silence; then a great silver-white light came into
being below, and spread swiftly outward toward the four points of the
compass.

Fighting the tendency of the Lockheed to yaw toward the dead engine
side, and struggling to keep the left outboard engine turning over,
Dave leaned over close to the shattered window and peered down into the
sea of silver-white light below. For a couple of seconds he couldn't
see anything but eye-dazzling light. Then as the flares dropped astern,
he was able to get a good look at the type of terrain below.

What he saw didn't exactly cause his chilled heart to warm up and loop
over with joy. True, they had safely crossed over the highest peaks of
that part of the mountain range. Below, though, were the tree-covered
foothills, cut by deep jagged stone sided ravines, and narrow plateau
formations of ground that would be hard for even a crow to alight on.

"It's no go, Dawson!" Colonel Welsh's voice suddenly broke the tingling
silence that had settled over the trio. "I know what's in your mind,
but our safest bet is for all three of us to jump. We've still got
three or four thousand feet of clearance. I think we should jump."

"I don't, not yet," Dave said bluntly, and raked the terrain below with
his eyes. "I think we should hang on a bit longer, and try to pick out
some spot big enough to slip into. This is wild country here, Colonel.
If we bail out we'll lose contact with each other, and all three of us
get lost. Let's look hard, first. I can keep her up a big longer. That
left outboard hasn't quit cold yet. And we're not losing altitude too
fast."

"All right," Colonel Welsh said grimly, and leaned forward the better
to study the flare-lighted ground below. "Confound that rat! I'd give a
lot to have his neck between my two hands right now!"

"I can think of things to do to him, myself," Dave grunted. Then, out
of the corner of his mouth: "Work those eagle eyes hard, Freddy. This
is where you should star. You always do see things first. Hurry up and
find Papa a place big enough to set us down in."

"Shut up and tend to your flying!" the English youth growled. "You
dropped our nose two feet while you were talking. Want to power dive
us in, or something? You--hold it, Dave! Bear right a bit. What's that
down there? It looks like--oh, blast it! They would, wouldn't they!"

The last was caused by the two flares finally touching ground and being
snuffed out. Quick as a flash Freddy Farmer shot out his hand and
released two more flares. The instant his eyes were again accustomed
to the bright light, Dave looked in the direction of the English
youth's pointed finger. His heart did loop with joy this time, and
he gulped with relief. What at first looked like the rock studded
side of a foothill was actually a strip of barren and seemingly level
ground between two foothills. It wasn't very big, but it seemed big
enough--unless Lady Luck deliberately turned her face the other way.

"Yeah, check, Freddy!" Dave murmured, and eased the laboring Lockheed
around and down. "That's us, that spot. Just hang on, everybody. It
won't be long now!"

"I don't like the way you say that!" Colonel Welsh said with a
mirthless laugh. "But I guess you don't mean it. Go ahead, though. I
was wrong again. We'll keep the parachutes in their packs. What a fine
night this has turned out to be!"

"Me, I'm thinking of tomorrow and next week," Dave muttered grimly as
he eased the Lockheed lower and lower, and around toward the near end
of the narrow landing space. "This is wild country here. It's plenty
wild. Right in the middle of nowhere. And this baby isn't going to do
any more flying until she has a couple of new engines stuck in her. Oh
well--"

Dave let the rest go with a shrug and hunched forward slightly over the
controls. The time for talking had passed. Now was the time for action,
and prayer. The Lockheed was down low now, too low to correct any
mistakes. The first swipe at that narrow landing space had to be good.
It had to be perfect. The jagged rocks and trees on all four sides
would make a second try impossible.

Dave's whole body felt dry as a chip, yet at the same time sweat poured
off his forehead, and the palms of his hands were clammy and cold. He
could almost feel Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh hold their breath.
As far as that went, he could almost feel the whole world stand still
and hold its breath. The dropped flares were throwing off less and less
light, but he refrained from telling Freddy to drop a couple of new
ones. Their first moment of brilliance might blind him just enough to
misjudge things by a hair. And misjudging by a hair would be more than
enough to pile them up in a heap among the trees and jagged rocks.

"Now!" he whispered softly. "Now, baby! Easy does it, now. Down you go.
Down you go. Ah-h-h...! That's the stuff!"

The Lockheed's wheels touched, touched hard, and the plane tried to
push itself off and up into the air again. But Dave had killed the
forward speed as much as he could. And after a short run forward,
and gentle but firm application of the wheel brakes by Dawson, the
twin-engined craft finally bumped to a halt not ten feet from the lip
of a sharp drop-off in the ground.

"Now I've seen everything!" Colonel Welsh fairly exploded the words.
"I've seen two miracles come to pass in the same night. It couldn't
be done, but you did it, Dawson. Congratulations from the bottom of my
heart. Good work! We really are on the ground, aren't we?"

Dave didn't bother to answer. As a matter of fact he couldn't have
said a single word at that moment even though it would have gained him
a million dollars. His heart was stuck halfway between his chest and
his throat, and refused to go up or down. It was the same with Freddy
Farmer, too. The English youth sat stiff and straight in his seat,
working his lips but making no sound. Eventually, though, he did manage
to get control of his tongue and of his frozen muscles. He reached
across and pressed Dave's arm.

"Top-hole, Dave!" he got out in a husky voice. "A bit of the very, very
best, and I mean it, really. As a pilot bloke myself, I know how good
you have to be to get away with that sort of thing. It was absolutely
perfect."

"What else?" Dave cracked back with a shaky laugh. "Look who did it!
But skip it. Is my hair grey, Freddy? Do I look very much older? I know
doggone well I gained forty years in those last couple of seconds.
Jeepers! Take a look at that drop-off ahead. Another ten feet and you
_wouldn't_ be thinking I was so hot. And I'm not, really. If Lady Luck
ever landed a plane, she did it that time, and I'm not kidding."

"Well, we're down, anyway," said Freddy. Then, getting practical: "What
do we do now? Do you know this area very well, sir? Have we got far to
go to the next village?"

Both Dave and the Colonel laughed in spite of the seriousness of the
situation. And Freddy made angry sounds in his throat.

"What's so blasted funny about that?" he demanded. "Do you plan to stay
here all night?"

"Sorry, Freddy," Dave said, and patted his pal's knee. "But this isn't
England, where you can throw a rock from one town and have it land in
the next one. This is our wild and woolly west. I don't know exactly
where we are, but I'd make a rough guess that we're a good two hundred
miles from the nearest town. And that's as the crow flies. Going over
and down these mountains and hills, you could add another two hundred
miles. What do you think, Colonel?"

"Well, not quite that far, Dawson," the senior officer said with a
laugh that was just a little too tight. "You're stretching it a little,
I'd say. Call it a hundred by air and two-fifty by foot, I guess.
We're just over the Arizona line and south of Holbrook. I'm afraid,
though, Farmer, that we will have to sit here for the rest of the
night, worse luck. To try and get out of here in the dark is just about
like deciding to step off some cliff and smash yourself to bits on the
bottom of a ravine. No. We've got to sit here until they find us."

"Hey!" Dave cried. "Aren't you forgetting something, Colonel? I mean,
who knows we're on our way? We--Oh, I see! You planned to send word
back to your office, eh? When they don't hear, they'll send planes
hunting for us, huh?"

The Colonel groaned heavily and clapped a hand to his forehead.

"You spoiled it that time, Dawson!" he muttered. "But you hit the
nail on the head. I did forget. I mean, I didn't say anything about
letting Lamb or Stacey know when I arrived at San Diego. They simply
expect to hear from me, when they hear. And my man at San Diego doesn't
actually know when I expect to arrive. This _is_ a sweet mess. I should
be demoted and kicked back into the ranks for not thinking of this
possibility. We're stuck, and no two ways about it."

"But we took this plane from the Alexandria Field," Dave said. "What
about their flight board there? Don't they list every take-off, the
pilot, and where he's heading?"

"Usually, but not in a case like this," the Colonel replied unhappily.
"When I borrow a plane, I don't tell them where I'm going. And
naturally, they don't ask me. But do we have to sit here in this
darkness, Dawson? The lights don't run off the engine, do they? How
about some light, eh?"

"Sure, sir," Dave said, and flipped up a couple of switches.

The interior of the compartment glowed with light, and the three looked
at each other. They grinned in a friendly sort of way, but neither of
them was particularly happy looking. Freddy Farmer twisted around in
his seat and looked at the Colonel.

"Then we might be here for some time, sir?" he asked.

"For several hours, at least, Farmer," the senior officer replied
gravely. "Nothing to worry about, though. As soon as it's light, we'll
build a fire and get a smoke signal in the air. A passing transport
plane may see it and come down to investigate. We're a bit south of
their regular run, though. Still, one of them may see it and get some
rescue parties sent out. Nothing to worry about."

"Not even your constant worry, pal," Dave laughed, and stuck a hand in
his tunic pocket. "Your constant worry about starving, I mean. Here's a
flock of chocolate bars I picked up at Alexandria Field before we left.
One thing I didn't tell you about Farmer, Colonel. If he can't eat
forty times a day he gets as weak as a kitten. And where he puts it,
I'll never know. Doesn't weigh more than a hundred and fifty soaking
wet. He's--"

"Some other time, my funny little man!" Freddy cut in harshly. "I
wasn't thinking about eating, if you must know the truth. Something
more serious. Or at least it will be serious if we're stuck here for a
considerable length of time."

Dave's smile faded immediately. He stared at the English youth. Colonel
Welsh also regarded him keenly.

"Okay, what?" Dave finally asked.

"The Carrier Indian," Freddy replied. Then, looking at the Colonel,
he asked, "Didn't you say that she weighs anchor sometime tomorrow
afternoon--this afternoon, really? If we're stuck here, will she sail
without us? Or has her skipper orders to wait for word from you?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence swallowed hard and made a wry face.

"That close-shave landing!" he muttered savagely. "It still has my
brains all scrambled up. You're quite right, Farmer. What you say makes
it more of a mess than ever. The Indian is to sail whether her skipper
hears from me or not. Those two men of mine serving as machinists'
mates are already aboard. At least they were to go aboard last evening.
But she won't wait for you two. The skipper has his sailing orders, and
he'll sail whether he's shy two pilot lieutenants or not. Blast and
double blast it all! What you say, Farmer, gives me a very disquieting
thought. Perhaps I _wasn't_ the one that unknown killer was interested
in. It's quite possible that it _was_ you two. The attempt was made
to stop you from reaching the Indian before she sailed. Confound it!
If I've fumbled this thing all up, I'll go out somewhere and cut my
throat. But--but I still can't see how anybody else could possibly have
found out about this flight, let alone the real reason!"

Dave didn't say anything, but he was thinking of a case he had heard
about in England not so long ago. A bad leak had been found in the Air
Ministry Intelligence, and when it was eventually tracked to its source
it was discovered that a high official's own secretary--a supposedly
loyal Englishman who had held his post since long before the outbreak
of war--was actually in the pay of the Nazis.

"I'm wondering something, myself," he said presently. "Not to toss more
cold water on things, Colonel, but--well, you don't know for sure if
your two men went aboard the Indian last evening, do you?"

"No, not for sure," the senior officer replied with a shake of his
head. "But it's--Oh, I see what you mean. Maybe they were--er--delayed,
too, eh? You think of the nicest things, Dawson! But keep on thinking.
Don't stop. Maybe you'll think of a way to get us out of this jam in a
hurry."

"I sure wish I could!" Dave said fervently. Then, reaching out and
taking a flashlight from the instrument panel clamps, he said,
"Meantime I'm going to have a look at the engines. I could be wrong
about an oil line being nicked. It wouldn't be the first time. Maybe
it's something that we can patch up with some gum and a piece of our
shirts, and we can get ourselves out of here come daylight. That's a
hope, anyway."

Half an hour later, though, it wasn't a hope. The oil feed lines of the
right outboard engine were split and parted in three different spots.
Besides that, she was seized up tighter than a drum, and couldn't be
made to move short of using dynamite. The left outboard engine wasn't
in a much better condition. Bullets from the unknown attacker's guns
had started a bad leak in the gas line that couldn't be repaired
without the proper tools. And so at the end of the half hour Dave wiped
oil and grease from his hands and climbed down off the wing onto the
ground where Freddy Farmer and the chief of Intelligence waited.

"No soap," he said bitterly. "If that bird's job was to delay us, he
did it up brown. The only way you'll get this plane out of here is to
fly in a couple of new engines. Nothing to do but wait for daylight."

"Why wait?" Freddy Farmer protested. "Let's get a fire going now. No
telling but what it might be seen by somebody. It--I say, though! What
about your Indians? They'd give us a bit of trouble, wouldn't they?
I've heard--"

"Hold everything, pal!" Dave chuckled, while Colonel Welsh struggled
to keep a straight face. "Nowadays you only find that kind of Indians
in books, or in the movies. Let's get the fire started. It's a good
idea. And if Indians do show up I'll welcome them as the flowers in
May."

Freddy Farmer hesitated and looked hard at Dawson. After a moment or so
he shrugged.

"Very well, then," he murmured. "But I swear I don't know when to
believe you, and when not to. If I get scalped--"

"You won't!" Dave stopped him, and backed away. "Head's too hard!"

Freddy took a quick half step forward, but gave it up. Then the three
of them started collecting deadwood, and stuff from the plane that
could be used to make a good fire.




CHAPTER NINE

_Rescue Wings_


Dawn came roaring up over the mountains to the east to touch off
their peaks with fire, and send rainbows of color arcing off in all
directions. It was a sight to make a man catch his breath and stand in
awe of the glorious majesty of nature. But for Dave Dawson and Freddy
Farmer and Colonel Welsh, the coming of the new day was more than just
something beautiful to watch and admire. It was like being released
from a prison of darkness.

As soon as there was enough light to allow vision at any great
distance, they eagerly and hopefully scrutinized their immediate
surroundings. But what they saw dashed their hopes even lower.
Heart-chilling wilderness met their gaze on all sides. It was as though
they had landed at the very end of the world; landed in a little pocket
of level ground completely lost in the depths of jagged rock sided
hills and towering snow-capped mountains.

For several minutes they looked about them in silence. Then, as though
at an unspoken signal, they turned and looked at each other, each man
reading the message of utter helplessness reflected in the next man's
eyes. It was Dave who finally broke the silence, and spoke the thought
that was in the minds of the other two.

"Our smoke signal won't be seen by any plane unless it passes directly
over this spot," he said. "These hills and mountains are such that
it's as if we were at the bottom of a well. And it's going to be even
tougher getting out of here on foot."

Neither Freddy Farmer or Colonel Welsh said anything. There wasn't
anything they could say. Dave had spoken the truth. And that was that.
Eventually Colonel Welsh knocked the ashes from his dead pipe and stuck
it back in his pocket.

"We'd better not try going out on foot for a while," he said, "at least
not until tomorrow. Better to stick here today and see if anything
happens. I'm mighty sorry this happened, you fellows. It's all my
fault, and I could kick myself right up the side of that mountain."

"I wouldn't say that, sir," Freddy Farmer said with a smile. "You had
no idea that chap was going to attack us last night."

"No," the chief of U. S. Intelligence growled. "Just the same,
ignorance is no excuse. I should have made sure, just in case the
unexpected did happen. I certainly should have taken a plane fitted
with a radio, instead of this one that hasn't got any. At least we
could have let the world know that we were going down for a forced
landing. But as it turned out--"

The Colonel sighed heavily and let the rest slide. Dave and Freddy
looked at each other and shrugged. It was no use crying over spilled
milk, but as a matter of cold hard fact both of them had been just
a little surprised when they had boarded the plane and seen that it
carried no radio. Neither, though, had said anything about it.

"Why wasn't it fitted with a radio, sir?" Dave finally blurted out the
question. "I mean--well, a radio is standard equipment on any ship. Is
there no radio on this for some particular reason?"

"Yes," the senior officer replied with a wry smile, and tapped his
chest. "I'm the reason. On a couple of occasions when the plane I
was in did have a radio, I was contacted about this and that every
half hour or so. Once I even turned back because of a message I had
received, only to find I'd wasted my time. Ever since then I've flown
without a radio. Been able to get more done, too. But I certainly
struck out this time. I'm sorry."

"Well, those things happen," Dave said politely, and let the subject
drop. "How about a short scouting trip about here? Or better yet, what
say I to make the top of that mountain, there? I guess I could do it in
a couple of hours. Maybe we're not buried as deep as we think we are.
Maybe I'll see a town, or a Ranger camp from there. Also, I may find
some berries and stuff, and a spring. The chocolate we have aboard, and
the drinking water, isn't going to last us for very long. What do you
think, Colonel? Think you can keep Freddy cheered up while I'm gone?
See that the Indians don't get him?"

The Colonel grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but what he was
about to say never left his lips. At that moment all three of them
heard the faint drone of a plane somewhere up in the sky, but out of
sight behind the towering mountains north of them. As one man they spun
around and stared hard at the dawn light bouncing off the snow-capped
peaks. Nobody said a word. Nobody could. They were all too busy
holding their breath, and praying as they had never prayed before.

After a few seconds Dave snapped out of his trance, ran over to the
pile of deadwood they had collected, grabbed up an armful, ran back to
the fire and dumped his load. Then he picked up a can of oil drained
from the engine and poured it on the licking flames. A second more and
a column of oily black smoke went towering up into the dawn sky.

"He can't miss that, unless he's blind!" Dave muttered through clenched
teeth as the black smoke mounted higher and higher. "Come on, whoever
you are, take a look, take a look!"

"Steady, Dawson," Colonel Welsh cautioned gently as Dave's voice rose
to a wild shout. "We've got to steel ourselves in case he doesn't see
it. Then it won't be so tough. This thing might happen several times,
you know. No telling. Save your strength, son. Take it easy."

Dave hardly heard the words of wisdom. His eyes were glued to the
north, his ears strained to catch every beat of the plane's engine
which was still out of sight, and his two fists clenched tight as
though he were actually pulling the unseen plane closer and closer.
Then, suddenly, the drone of the engine grew louder. It rose to a
mighty roar. And then the plane came sailing into view above the
mountain peaks. It was a five-place Stinson cabin plane, a commercial
plane probably owned by some rancher. There were no markings on the
craft other than the usual Bureau of Aeronautics license letter and
number. A wild cry of joyous relief struggled up Dave's throat but was
unable to pass his lips. A riot of emotions boiled up within him, and
his lips and his tongue were suddenly too dry to form sounds. So he
simply stood stock still and grinned from ear to ear as the cabin plane
cleared the peak and then came nosing down toward them; circling down
like some giant bird seeking a spot to light on.

When it was less than five hundred feet over their heads, the three men
shook themselves loose from their paralytic spell and started jumping
around and waving their arms wildly as though the pilot of the plane
hadn't seen them yet. The pilot waggled his wings as a signal that he
had, and then leveled off and went coasting toward the eastern end
of the landing strip. There he circled back, suddenly fed hop to his
engine and started to climb. For one horrible moment Dave was afraid
the pilot had decided that he couldn't put his plane down on the small
strip. But he was wrong. The pilot had simply goosed his engine to add
enough to his speed to clear the tops of some tall trees. He slipped
over them, went up on left wing a bit, and slid down to level off in a
perfect landing.

Even as the plane was braking to a stop, Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel
rushed back to it. They pulled up to a halt, waited for the plane to
roll the last few feet, then ducked under the left wing and around to
the cabin door. They had already seen that there were two men aboard
the plane, the pilot and a passenger. As Dave watched them come back
from the pilot's nook to the cabin door, he was faintly surprised by
their looks. Why, he didn't know, but somehow he had expected to see
a couple of youngsters climb down from the plane. But they weren't
young. They were both well along in years. They had hard, rugged faces,
covered by at least a two week's growth of whiskers. They wore rough
clothing, and each man carried a gun slung at his hip. The guns were
not pistols, though. They were automatics, and Dave suddenly had the
hunch that their rescuers were a couple of fire rangers, or at least
some kind of government men. The way they leaped cat-like out the cabin
door and down onto the ground seemed somehow to suggest the military
to Dave. But what they were didn't matter in the slightest. They had
arrived to rescue them, and that was all that counted.

"Stuck, huh?" the older one of the pair grunted, and grinned. "Lucky we
happened to see your smoke signal. You might have camped here for quite
a spell. Army and Navy, huh?"

"And in a hurry," Colonel Welsh said. Then, after introducing himself:
"We had a forced landing. Er--engine trouble. Can you fly us to the
nearest Air Corps Base where we can pick up another plane? I'll see
that you're paid for it, of course."

"Guess so," the man grunted after a look at his partner. "But where're
you headed? Maybe we could hop you all the way, and save time, if
you're in such a hurry."

"San Diego," Colonel Welsh said. "I have to get there as soon as
possible. But maybe you haven't the gas."

"San Diego, huh?" the older one, who was the pilot, murmured, and
arched his brows. "Yeah. I guess we can make it there from here. Had
engine trouble, huh? Not much fun in this neck of the woods. Okay. Get
aboard."

A hidden thought was tugging at Dave's brain, but he couldn't seem to
get it out in the open. Something was just a wee bit wrong with the
picture, but after a moment of deep thought he decided it was worry
about a take-off from the narrow space of level ground.

"Think you've got a long enough run?" he asked, and jerked a thumb at
the crippled Lockheed. "Maybe the five of us should haul that out of
the way. But even then you wouldn't have much extra. There's a sharp
drop-off just ahead of it."

"Don't get in a sweat, kid," the man mouthed, and gave him a hard
stare. "I wouldn't have come down if I'd thought I couldn't get off
again. Just get aboard and keep your seat. We'll get you places, and
with no trouble at all. Okay, Colonel, let's get going."

With a curt nod the pilot and his passenger turned and climbed back
into the plane. Colonel Welsh followed at their heels, but for an
instant Dave and Freddy hung back. They looked at each other and
frowned slightly.

"Queer couple of blokes, aren't they?" the English youth murmured.
"Can't say I like their looks much."

"I've seen better," Dave replied with a nod. "But so long as they
get us out of here, I don't care what they look like. But--is there
something on your mind?"

"Not a thing," Freddy replied. Then, with a puzzled scowl: "Just sort
of feel funny, though. One of your confounded hunches, I guess. Oh
well! No doubt it's your American climate. I'm sure I should have
stayed in England."

"Hop in, or do you two kids want to stay and play boy scout?"

The Stinson's passenger stood framed in the cabin doorway. His blue
green eyes stabbed down at Dave and Freddy, and the mop of coarse red
hair on his head actually did look like fire in the glow of the dawn
sun. Dave stared at him, felt that elusive thought tug at his brain for
the last time, and then climbed into the plane with Freddy right behind.

The pilot at the controls glanced back just long enough to see that
everybody was aboard, and then he goosed the engine and taxied around
on one wheel, and went trundling back toward the far end of the landing
strip. His friend, the redhead, sat in the co-pilot's seat, but he was
twisted around so that he faced Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel, who
were sitting in the three passenger seats. A grin parted his lips, but
he seemed to be grinning over their heads rather than at them.

For a brief instant a clammy chill rippled through Dave. He shook it
off, angrily told himself that he was letting his imagination run wild,
and concentrated on watching the pilot take the plane off. It was a
beautiful bit of flying, and Dave nodded his head in silent approval
and admiration as the pilot held the Stinson on the ground until he had
plenty of forward speed, then gently eased it off and up as nice as
could be.

Holding the nose up, the pilot circled the Stinson upwards until the
mountain peaks were almost on a level with the wings. Flattening off
the climb, he banked around for the last time and went roaring between
two mountain peaks to the north. For a couple of minutes Dave was too
thrilled by the wild, heart stopping beauty of the mountain scenery
below to pay much attention to the course of the plane. Eventually,
though, when the sun continued to stay on the right wing side, he
stopped gaping at the terrain below, and glanced sharply ahead. The
redhead was still grinning, very comfortably relaxed in his seat. And
the pilot was still holding the nose pointed north as though he planned
to keep going in that direction for quite some time to come.

Dave held his peace for a moment or so longer. Then curiosity and an
eerie tingling sensation at the back of his neck forced the words off
his lips.

"We're heading north!" he called out. "San Diego isn't north of us!"

Both Colonel Welsh and Freddy Farmer jumped as though they had been
shot. They turned and stared at him, wide-eyed. The redhead stared at
him, too. But his eyes were slightly narrowed, and his perpetual grin
stiffened slightly. He didn't say anything.

"Well, what is the idea, anyway?" Colonel Welsh finally boomed angrily.
"San Diego is west and south of here!"

The redhead shrugged and nodded, but the pilot didn't even turn his
head.

"That's right, isn't it?" he called out. "Well, what do you know about
that? I guess we ain't heading for San Diego, Colonel. Kind of looks
that way, don't it, huh?"

Colonel Welsh blinked and looked blank for a moment. Then his face
reddened and he started up out of his seat.

"See here!" he thundered. "What in--?"

The redhead made a quick motion, and the chief of U. S. Intelligence
choked off the rest. But it was the automatic that suddenly seemed to
jump right into the redhead's hand that really stopped him. He froze
motionless half up out of his seat. The redhead waved the gun a little.

"Relax, and sit, Colonel!" he said in a voice that sounded like small
stones on a tin roof. "I couldn't let you have it down there, but up
here it's easy. Relax and get smart. And that goes for you two kids,
too!"




CHAPTER TEN

_Vulture's Nest_


For a long minute there was no sound inside the cabin save the faint
drone of the plane's engine. Like three men suddenly struck dumb, Dave,
Freddy, and the Colonel stared at the redhead. Rather, they stared at
the automatic he held in his right hand; held so that at the bat of
an eyelash he could send a bullet into either of them, or into all
three of them, for that matter. Then, finally, Colonel Welsh broke the
silence.

"What in thunder _is_ this?" he demanded. "Who are you two? What's the
idea?"

The redhead hunched his shoulders and half nodded his head toward the
pilot.

"That's Ike, and I'm Mike," he said with a chuckle. "But it isn't any
act. We're just keeping you on ice for a while, Colonel. Be nice and
you'll get back into circulation again in time. Be dumb, and you'll be
dead."

As the Colonel struggled for words, Dave leaned forward a little, arms
resting on his knees.

"This isn't the plane you flew last night," he said.

The redhead grinned all the more and shook his head.

"Nope," he said. "And that makes you a bright little boy--Flight
Lieutenant Dawson. And that was nice flying last night. I thought that
second time I had you cold. I guess you're as good at the controls as
I've heard tell you were. Or was this English kid, Farmer, doing the
flying?"

Dave didn't reply. He suddenly felt as though his seat had been
jerked out from under him, and as if his brain were tumbling down
through space. This redhead knew his name, and Freddy's, too? An eerie
chill swept through him, and he impulsively looked at Colonel Welsh.
The chief of U. S. Intelligence's face was bright with dumfounded
amazement. He in turn was staring speechlessly at the redhead. The man
with the gun dragged down a corner of his mouth in a scornful gesture.

"Why so surprised, Colonel?" he asked. "Did you think you were the only
smart one in this war?"

"You won't feel so smart when you're facing a firing squad!" the
Colonel clipped out. "And that's where you're headed. Both of you!"

"Well, what do you know!" the pilot cried out, and turned around just
long enough to give the Colonel a horse laugh. "Maybe you ain't got it
yet, Colonel, who's holding the gun. Snap out of it. I know it's tough,
but there's nothing you can do about it. Don't be a sap and make us let
you have it. We just want to keep you on ice for a while. That's all."

The Colonel seemed to swallow his wrath, because when he spoke again
his voice was normal, and almost friendly.

"All right, we'll be smart," he said. "But where are we heading? And
why are you keeping us on ice, as you call it? What good is it going to
do you?"

"What good?" the redhead echoed with a laugh. "Well, about ten thousand
dollars' worth, for one thing. For another--well, I guess we just don't
like you."

A hard, glittering look leaped into the Colonel's eyes, and Dave could
tell that the man was employing every ounce of his will power to stop
from leaping from his seat and hurling himself at the redhead, gun or
no gun.

"A couple of bought and paid for American traitors, eh?" the chief of
U. S. Intelligence suddenly grated. "American by birth only. Actually
lower than the rats in Berlin and Tokio are--the ones who are paying
you your blood money. Well, paste this in your hats. You'll never live
to spend that money. And that's a promise!"

The redhead simply continued to grin. Then suddenly the gun in his hand
spat flame and sound, and Dave saw the Colonel's left shoulder strap
fly off as though cut by a knife. The bullet tore on out through the
side of the cabin. Colonel Welsh didn't so much as flinch, or even bat
an eye. He held the redhead with a steady agate-eyed stare.

"Put the next right between my eyes!" he grated. "You'll still not
be able to spend that blood money. You'll be run to earth like the
anti-American vermin you are. And you'll be wiped out, along with the
rest of your fifth column brood."

The redhead didn't say anything. Dave wasn't sure, but he thought he
saw a look of fear flash across the man's unshaven face. However, it
came and went in a flash. The pilot turned from his controls again, and
gave the Colonel a long look.

"Maybe!" he finally said harshly. "That's the chance we take. But let's
not kid each other, Colonel. The point is that the Carrier Indian won't
be sailing with these two little heroes of yours aboard. Yeah! So don't
look like you're going to faint. We know all about it. The boys we work
for are smart. And your whole country is going to find that out in
short order, too.

"You guys in Washington have got a New Deal. Well, another guy has a
_New Deal_, too. I like his better. So don't waste breath trying to
unsell me. It can't be done. I've been kicked around too much by your
cops and F.B.I.

"I'm looking out for my own good, see? I found out how my pal and me
can make dough easy, and we're making it. No more working my life away
for nothing. I'm sold on _my_ New Deal.

"Now shut up, and relax. My pal and me have dough to earn."

"Aw, let 'em talk!" the redhead said with a hoarse laugh. "Maybe
they'll try selling us some of them Defense Bonds."

"And you shut up, too!" the pilot snarled. "I don't feel like hearing
anybody talk, see?"

The redhead looked both surprised and angry.

"Okay, okay!" he said. "So nobody talks."

Silence once more settled over the interior of the cabin, but it was
the kind of a silence that feels charged with high voltage electricity,
and apt to strike all over the place at an instant's notice. Turning
his head, Dave snapped a quick glance out the window, but what he saw
didn't help his spirits any. The plane was grinding northward over wild
mountainous country that looked every bit as uninviting as that narrow
strip of ground where they had force landed. Whether or not they had
reached the Utah line, or were still in Arizona, Dave couldn't tell
with that one quick glance. And he didn't bother taking a second look.

Fact was, it didn't matter where they were. Through a crazy twist of
fate they were helpless prisoners in the hands of two men who would
shoot them dead at the slightest provocation. The single warning shot
that the redhead had snapped across Colonel Welsh's shoulder had been
proof enough that he wasn't afraid to use his gun.

Yes, they were helpless prisoners. And their captors knew all about
them: who they were, where they had been heading, and why. As those
three truths came home to Dave, again he swallowed hard and shivered
slightly. It was like a crazy nightmare, only it wasn't. It was stark
reality; nothing out of a story book. The pilot and his redheaded
companion had received orders to make sure that Freddy Farmer and he
did not sail on the Aircraft Carrier Indian. They had tried the first
time last night by attacking them with machine guns in a plane.

They had failed, yet in a way they had succeeded. They had drilled the
Lockheed's engines and forced Dave to sit down on that narrow strip
of smooth ground deep in a valley. Not knowing the exact results of
their efforts, the two men had cruised about over the area as soon as
it became light, and--by another crazy twist of fate--they had seen
the smoke signal that had been sent up to attract _help_. Seeing that
the plane had not crashed, the two men had done the logical thing,
from their point of view. They had landed and picked up their prey.
Kidnapped them, yes, but for a very good reason. Some other plane
passing over might have landed and given them a quick lift to their
destination. So the redhead and the pilot had picked them up to make
sure somebody else wouldn't do it.

And the reason they hadn't been killed on the spot was simple to
figure. Death in the dark during that air attack last night would
have been different. The plane would have crashed and burned up, and
when its charred ruins were found no one would ever had dreamed that
bullets had sent it hurtling down to its doom. But three dead men lying
beside a force landed plane was something else again. A scene like
that naturally screamed murder all over the place. And so the redhead
and his pilot had kidnapped them so that if another plane landed to
investigate, it would look as though the occupants of the Lockheed had
tried to find their way back to civilization on foot, and had become
hopelessly lost in the mountains.

"But they know all about us! How?"

Dave didn't speak the words aloud. He spoke them only in his brain,
but as he glanced at Colonel Welsh and met the man's eyes he knew that
the senior officer understood what was in his mind, just as though he
had heard the words spoken. Even as Dave met his eyes, Colonel Welsh
bit his lower lip and gave a sharp little puzzled shake of his head. A
hundred and one answers to the question leaped into Dave's brain, but
every one of them seemed too fantastic even to bother considering.

However, fantastic or not, one thought kept hammering away until he was
forced to admit that it at least must be true. It was that somebody
close to Colonel Welsh--very close--was unquestionably in the pay of
Berlin, or Tokio. Somebody in the drab, unpretentious building where
Colonel Welsh maintained his real head-quarters was a traitor to the
American flag, a paid rat of the lowest form who gnawed at the very
heart of America.

But who? Dave thought of Captain Lamb, and Captain Stacey, and
Lieutenant Caldwell--and shook his head vigorously. He thought of the
man who had taken them up in the elevator--and wondered. He thought
of the man reading the book in that room with the mops and pails--and
wondered some more. In fact, he wondered until his head ached and his
brain rang. It just didn't seem possible that any spy could get close
enough to learn all that somebody had learned. That, however, was one
of the many cockeyed things about war. The impossible was constantly
popping up to prove to be a cinch. There were over two years of proof
of that. Poland for one. The Maginot Line for another. And Crete, and
Malaya, and Singapore--and Pearl Harbor, too, for that matter. All that
had happened at those various places just couldn't happen. Only it
_had_!

"So maybe Lamb, or Stacey, or--"

Dave cut short the unspoken thought. The pilot up forward had throttled
his engine and was nosing the Stinson downward. Leaning over close
to the window, Dave peered down and ahead. He saw a stretch of wild
wasteland that seemed to extend to the four horizons. Scrub growth,
a few patches of towering trees, and all the rocks in the world, it
seemed, met his scrutiny. The plane seemed to be nosing down toward an
area of tableland. And as Dave squinted his eyes he suddenly was able
to make out a couple of weatherbeaten shacks built close to a patch of
woods. He thought he saw something glistening just under the branches
of the trees, but he was too high and too far away to tell what it was.

"Okay!" the redhead suddenly called out. "We're getting near the end
of the line. Remember what I told you, you three. Be nice and nothing
will happen. Get funny and I'll drill you and think nothing of it, so
help me. I ain't a killer often, but when I am, I'm good. So watch your
step."




CHAPTER ELEVEN

_A Little Bit Of England!_


Dave didn't bother looking at the redhead as the man pushed words off
the tip of his tongue. He kept his nose pressed against the cabin
window and watched with beating heart as the area of tableland came
sweeping up closer and closer to the plane. The nearer the plane got to
the ground, the more weatherbeaten and deserted the two shacks looked.
In fact, Dave knew that if he should be flying over them at even a
thousand feet or so, he would instantly take them for a couple of
prospectors' shacks abandoned to the wind and the rain years and years
before.

Another couple of minutes and the Stinson went up on wing, cut around
in a dime turn, and then leveled off and settled to earth between two
rows of sun-bleached rocks. Hardly had the plane braked to a halt than
the redhead was at the cabin door, pushing it open with one hand behind
him, and backing out. Every second of the time, though, he kept his
blue green eyes fastened on his prisoners.

"I'll take them inside while you put the job away," he said to the
pilot. "Stick her way under the trees with that Waco, just in case some
nosy guys come flying over. Nuts to take chances, you know. We'll--"

"Can it!" the pilot snarled. "Who are you, giving orders? Take them
inside. I'll be along in a minute, and help tie them up. But keep that
gun ready, and use it if you have to. We can't risk anything, see?"

"I see, sure I see!" the redhead snarled back. "What's eating you,
anyway?"

"Nothing, and shut up!" the pilot said in a brittle voice.

The redhead nodded, and motioned with his gun to Dave and the other two.

"Out!" he snapped. "And watch it. And keep your hands in sight, too."

Dave obeyed to the letter, but his heart was thumping against his ribs.
He had a sneaky feeling that Colonel Welsh's words had had a profound
effect on the pilot. Sure, he had snarled, and boasted, and cursed the
United States, the land of his birth. But like all rats of his ilk,
deep down in his black heart he was scared stiff of the Old Man With
the Whiskers. Deep down in his heart he knew that he might get by with
this back stabbing for a little while--just like the Japs--but not for
long. In the end he would be caught in the wheels of right and justice
and be ground to a pulp.

With the pilot feeling as he obviously did, snapping and snarling at
his own partner in this dirty work, perhaps something could be made of
it. Perhaps--

Dave didn't finish the rest. Without realizing it he had sort of
stopped to mull things over as he climbed down from the plane. He had
unconsciously started to push one hand into his tunic pocket. He didn't
even realize he was making the movement, but the redhead saw it, took
it for the wrong thing, and moved with the speed of light. The barrel
of the automatic was slapped against the left side of Dave's jaw just
hard enough for him to see stars and stumble. He ended up by falling
the rest of the way out of the cabin doorway and landing flat on his
face on hard dirt.

"And stay there!" he heard the redhead growl. "I'll take that gun just
as soon as your two pals are down. Okay, you two. Out, and keep your
hands where I can see them. Okay! Now, flat on your bellies and hands
outstretched. Either of you move, and you get it."

A moment later Dave felt the muzzle of the automatic pressed against
the back of his head, and felt the redhead's other hand going through
his pockets. He didn't move a muscle, and presently an angry curse told
him that the redhead realized he was wrong. Then the gun tapped him
lightly on the head.

"Stay put, with your hands out!" the redhead said. "I'll just make sure
about your pals."

Dave kept his throbbing face buried in the dirt until he heard the
redhead's voice again.

"Okay, on your feet, and inside! And no more kidding moves like that
last one, Dawson. My trigger finger's getting plenty itchy. Okay, move!"

Dave got slowly to his feet, blinked from his eyes water caused by
smacking the ground with his face, and walked stiff-legged in through
the door of the nearest shack. He expected to step into a room heavy
with age, and dust, and dirt, and all the countless smells of the
years. But he didn't. He stepped into a large sized room that was
comfortably furnished and fitted out like a hunting lodge. No, not
exactly a hunting lodge. Rather, it looked more like an arsenal.
There were guns all over the place, of all types: pistols, automatics,
rifles, and machine guns. Along the entire right wall were heavy wood
boxes that obviously contained thousands and thousands of rounds of
ammunition.

But what caught Dave's eyes and held them was the powerful gas engine
operated short-wave radio receiving set and transmitter that took up
most of the space at the rear of the room. One glance told him that
every part of it was of the finest equipment, and that its operator
could contact points thousands and thousands of miles away. One look at
the set and he guessed instantly that one of its chief uses was to send
weather data to listening Axis ears. This was probably one of several
such stations hidden in the vastness of the United States. In time they
would be smoked out and destroyed. Meantime, though, they were serving
the Axis powers well, and, unquestionably, in a dozen different ways.

"Not bad, huh?" he heard the redhead's voice with its taunting note.
"We have lots of fun here, Mike and Ike. See what I mean, Colonel? We
got it all doped out. You Army and Navy guys are suckers. You don't
stand a chance, what I mean. When the time's right, we'll move in.
And that's all there'll be to it, see? Steady, Colonel! Steady, pal.
Rushing me will just get you a bullet in that belly of yours. Take it
easy, and relax. Back up, and sit down on that case. You two kids, too."

As the redhead grinned and made motions with the gun, Dave, Freddy,
and the Colonel slowly backed up until they were sitting on a couple
of gun cases. Once they were settled, with their hands carefully kept
in sight, the redhead hooked one leg over a nearby table and absently
stroked the palm of his other hand with the barrel of his automatic.
Dave heard Colonel Welsh's tight, rasping breathing beside him, but he
didn't look at the man. Nor did he glance at Freddy Farmer, who hadn't
spoken a word since they had entered the Stinson. Instead, Dave kept
his eyes fixed on the redhead--and waited, and hoped, and prayed.

"Yeah, we have us some fun here," the redhead went on, and looked
straight at Colonel Welsh. "But soon we're going to have some real fun.
See all these guns, Colonel? Lots of people are going to hear them pop
off, soon. People east in Washington, too. The boys running this show
have it all doped out. It'll be a cinch."

"Do you know what you are?" the Colonel suddenly asked with an effort.

"No, you tell me, Colonel," the redhead said with a chuckle. Then,
before Colonel Welsh could get a word in edgewise: "You know, I'd
never tab you for head of the Intelligence, Colonel. You don't look
the part to me at all. But maybe that's what's made you the great man
of mystery, eh? Well, the mystery is over as far as I'm concerned. And
to tell you the truth, I'm kind of disappointed. When we got the radio
flash that you were aboard a plane heading west with these two kids,
I got kind of all excited. I got kind of sorry, too, that I'd have to
shoot you down without having a look at you. But--well, I did get that
look after all. And I'm disappointed."

"And you are a complete and utter fool!" Colonel Welsh said,
tight-lipped. "I told you once, and I tell you again! You'll never get
away with this. You'll be caught and either strung up, or shot. You'll
get--"

"Didn't I tell you to shut up? Well, do it. We can't be bothered
listening to your junk. Shut up! _Do you hear me!_"

It was the voice of the pilot, who had suddenly appeared in the
doorway. He stood glaring at Colonel Welsh out of eyes that held a
wild, glassy glitter. Two white spots appeared on either cheek, and as
the last left his lips they came together to form a thin cruel line.
Then before Colonel Welsh, or Dave, or Freddy Farmer could so much as
move a muscle, the man leaped forward and slammed his upholstered gun
against the Colonel's left temple. The chief of U. S. Intelligence
slumped over, but caught himself and straightened up slowly. A trickle
of blood ran down from the cut on his temple, but he made no effort to
raise his hand to it. He looked at the pilot and smiled grimly. Dave
marveled silently at the man's courage and ability to take it. The blow
he had received was enough to knock over a horse.

"Swing again, you rat traitor!" the Colonel got out evenly. "You know
in your heart that you're sunk. And it's making you lose your grip."

For an instant Dave thought the pilot was going to go stark raving
mad with rage and hurl himself at the Colonel. But he didn't. With a
visibly tremendous effort he regained control of himself and forced a
harsh laugh off his lips.

"That's what you think!" he snapped. Then out of the corner of his
mouth to his partner: "Get that rope, and we'll tie them up. We'll gag
this big slob. I'm sick of hearing his yapping."

Less than five minutes later Dave and Freddy were bound hand and foot.
Colonel Welsh was bound hand and foot, too, but he was also gagged. The
pilot made sure that the ropes were tied right, then turned his back
on them and walked over to a table on the other side of the room. He
picked up a whiskey bottle there, took a long drink and choked on it.
He coughed so hard he almost dropped the bottle. He would have if the
redhead hadn't jumped quickly forward and grabbed it.

"Hey, what's the matter with you?" the redhead demanded angrily. "You
getting the jim-jams? This is no time to fall apart. Snap out of it.
Get hold of yourself. Boy! Wouldn't the big boss like to see you, now.
I knew he should have put me in charge of this station."

The pilot suddenly went white about the corners of his mouth, and there
was cold murder in the eyes he fixed on the redhead. He reached out and
tapped the redhead on the chest with the barrel of his automatic.

"Just say that again, lug," he grated. "Go on! Just say it again!"

The redhead seemed to wilt like a flower tossed into a blast furnace.
He gulped and swallowed hard, and backed away a couple of steps.

"Okay, okay!" he got out hastily. "I was only kidding. But I only
thought--"

"Nobody wants you to think!" the pilot snarled, and took a step
forward. "Get it? Cut out the thinking. Now, get on that key and
contact Frisco. Tell them we've got them on ice, and what do we do now?
Tell them this place is cooked, if either of these three should get
away. Find out where he wants them delivered, or what. He was nuts to
have us go hunting them, and bring them back here. They'd have been
stuck there a week, anyway. And that's more time than we need to fly
these guns and stuff to the other places. But skip that last. Don't
tell them that, understand. The big boy wouldn't like it."

"I'll say he wouldn't!" the redhead said with a tight laugh, and went
through the motions of slitting his throat from ear to ear. "Okay. I'll
find out what we do now. Fun, I hope."

The redhead flung the trio of prisoners a leering look, then went to
the back of the room and sat down at the radio equipment. A moment or
so later the crackling of the spark gap of a wireless set filled the
room. Dave closed his eyes and strained his ears. He caught the signal
being sent out. It was S-T. It was repeated a dozen times or more.
Then the man stopped sending, and there was silence as he listened to
whatever was coming through his earphones. After twenty seconds or so
he started sending again. Dave caught all the signals, but that's all
the good it did him. He glanced at Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh, and
knew that they were catching the signals, too, and that the code going
out over the air was just as meaningless to them as it was to him.

For five minutes the redhead "talked" with the man at the other end of
the wave length. Then he switched off his set, got up and turned around
with a grin on his face that stretched from ear to ear.

"He thinks we're great guys," he said to his partner. "He thinks we're
the nuts."

"Horses to what he thinks!" the pilot growled, and ran a nervous tongue
tip along his lower lip. "What do we do now? What are his orders?"

"To sit tight," the redhead said. Then, after flashing Colonel Welsh a
smirking look, he went on, "He's coming up here sometime tonight. He
didn't say, but I've got a hunch he wants to work on our three friends
here. But he's tickled silly about it all. What a break for us we were
bum shots last night. This little job puts us in good, I'm telling you.
Boy! You can't top the big boss, can you? He knows his onions right
down the line. Yeah! Old blabber mouth, there, is going to have plenty
of chance to work his yap. And I mean, but plenty! Maybe he won't want
to, but I've seen the big boss's way of getting guys to talk. He's got
a technique, he has!"

"Coming up tonight, huh?" the pilot echoed with a happy smile. "Swell!
That means you and me will be shifted to some other station. And
that'll suit me okay. This neck of the woods is giving me the creeps.
Thirty days here. It's been like thirty years. Let's have a drink on
getting out of here soon."

"Yeah!" the redhead said, and licked his lips. "Let's have a couple of
them. I'm dry as a bone."

With that moment began an hour and a half that was just about the
toughest ninety minutes Dave Dawson had ever spent in his life. The
two unshaven men went over to the table and dropped into chairs and
proceeded to ignore their prisoners. That didn't bother Dave in the
slightest, though. He was quite content to have the two ignore him,
for he was too busy with his thoughts--thoughts that tumbled and
spilled around in his brain like little red hot stones. A hundred times
at least he strained at the ropes that held his wrists bound behind
his back. And a hundred times circles of white pain about his wrists
convinced him that he didn't stand a chance in the world of freeing his
hands, to say nothing of his ankles. A hundred times he cursed himself
bitterly for not getting away from that attacker last night--and
without damage to the Lockheed's engines. A hundred times he thought of
the Aircraft Carrier Indian and the unknown doom that hovered over her;
the unknown doom that was aboard her in the form of some rat Axis spy
who had killed and obtained vital information that could easily spell
disaster for many of Uncle Sam's fighting men of the sea if it reached
Japanese hands soon enough.

A hundred times he thought of many things, and each time his utter
helplessness to do anything about them was like a hot knife twisting
in his heart. But the most torturing thing of all was the realization
that he and Freddy had been stopped cold before they had even been able
to get started. The Carrier Indian was over three hundred miles away,
riding at anchor in San Diego harbor. Who knew when they would see it?
Who knew if they would _ever_ see it? Caught cold before they had even
got started on the very first of the special assignments they were to
carry out for Uncle Sam. What a sweet beginning! Yes! What a sweet
beginning that could well be the end, too. And that end might come when
the man referred to as the big boss arrived.

Thoughts, thoughts, and more thoughts that walked, raced, cut and
slashed their way through Dave's brain. Seconds dragged on into
minutes, and the minutes seemed to drag on into an eternity of time.
Then suddenly sound forced its way through Dave's thoughts and brought
him back to the present. The sound was soft moaning and groaning. And
it came from Freddy Farmer's lips.

The English youth was sitting on a gun case just beyond where Colonel
Welsh sat, but out in front of him so that Dave could see his pal.
And the look on Freddy's face was one of great pain, and not a little
of terror, and fear. His eyes were half closed, and he seemed to be
staring at nothing at all as he rocked jerkily back and forth like some
African savage praying to his idol gods. For a brief instant Dave
could hardly believe his eyes or his ears. Then a wave of sympathy
mingled with just a little annoyance swept through him.

"Pull up your socks, Freddy!" he said in a low voice. "Show these rats
you can take it. Come on, Freddy. Chin up, pal!"

The English youth groaned louder and opened his eyes a little. The look
he flung Dave burned with scorn.

"Blast you and your chin-up rot!" he grated. "I've had enough of this.
Gangster stuff, this is, not war. I know now I should never have left
England. This is a madman's country. I tell you I've had enough of it!"

Freddy fairly screamed the last, and had Dave not been tied hand and
foot he would have leaped over and slapped his pal's jaw. Something had
happened to Freddy Farmer. Something had snapped inside of him. Dave
had seen his pal in a hundred tight corners, every bit as tight as this
one. He knew full well that Freddy was red-blooded courage from his
head to his feet. But something had happened, and the English youth was
ready to crack up like an hysterical old woman.

"Freddy, cut it out!" he snapped. "Buck up, old man. Show them. Come
on, Freddy. The old R.A.F. stuff. We're not licked yet, and we won't
be. You know that!"

The English youth didn't answer at once. He sat swaying and groaning,
and staring at Dave out of half closed eyes. Then suddenly he began to
laugh softly. The laugh grew and grew until it was almost a scream.
The pilot and the redhead had put down their whiskey glasses and were
staring at him in wide-eyed amazement.

"R.A.F., my hat!" Freddy suddenly shouted. "This isn't war. This is
gangster business, like I've seen in your American movies. Well, I've
had enough of it. I can't stand it, do you understand. _I can't stand
it!_ These ropes are killing me. I feel as if I were all on fire!"

Freddy stopped short, looked over at the unshaven pair and spoke again
before Dave had time to open his mouth.

"I say, a drink of water, please!" he gasped. "I must have a drink of
water. I'm dying, really. I can't stand the pain. A drink of water,
please!"

The pair stared for a moment longer; then the redhead burst out with
laughter.

"The tough English, huh?" he jeered aloud. "Look at the brave R.A.F.
pilot, I don't think! Well, what do you know? The English can't take
it. I always said they couldn't. Mama! Mama! Sonny boy wants a drink of
water. Here! Pour a slug of this whiskey down his throat and make a man
of him. Okay, I'll do it!"

The redhead laughed some more and splashed whiskey from the bottle into
his glass. He pushed up from the table and came swaggering over to
Freddy Farmer.

"Here you are, sonny boy," he said, and leaned over to put the glass to
the English youth's lips. "Be Papa's great big man. Have a drink. Go
on, take some!"

Freddy Farmer groaned just once more, then leaned forward as though he
were going to drink. But he didn't drink. He became an exploding ball
of chain lightning, instead. Almost before Dave Dawson's startled eyes
could register what was taking place, Freddy Farmer whipped his right
hand around from behind his back and plucked the redhead's automatic
from its holster. In what was practically the same motion, the English
youth stood up and clubbed the gun down on the redhead's ear. At the
same time Freddy brought up his left clenched fist and landed solidly
on the man's jaw. The man closed his eyes, and folded up like an old
army cot to the floor.

The English youth didn't so much as watch the redhead crumple. Instead
he brought the automatic down into line with the pilot sitting stunned
at the table on the other side of the room.

"Don't even wink an eye!" Freddy barked, and slowly sat down again. "I
can put a bullet in your rotten heart from here with my eyes closed.
Keep your hands just as they are on the table. Don't move them an inch,
you dirty blighter!"




CHAPTER TWELVE

_Westward To War_


As Freddy Farmer hurled the words at the pilot, he reached down with
his other hand and fumbled with the ropes tied about his ankles. In
less than a minute he had them free. Still keeping his eye on the
pilot, who now was practically green with terror, he went over and
around in back of the man. In less time than it takes to tell about it,
he had his gun. Then he jerked him from his chair and spun him around.

"Sorry, old thing," he said, tight-lipped. "But you shouldn't say
things like that about America. Next to England, it's the grandest
country on earth."

The pilot blinked stupidly. Then he closed his eyes for good. He did
so because Freddy Farmer slugged him on the jaw, putting every ounce
of his one hundred and fifty-five pounds behind the blow. The pilot
turned slowly around twice, then fell flat on his face alongside his
unconscious pal. And it was then Dave realized he was not dreaming, and
was able to find his tongue.

"Holy jumping jellyfish!" he gasped. "I--I thought you'd blown your
top, Freddy. But it was a gag, huh? Boy, oh boy! Me for you, pal, every
day in the week, and twice on Sundays. Gee, Freddy! I'm a no good bum
for thinking--"

"Quite!" the English youth said with a wide grin. "But I'll forgive you
this once. But speaking of gags. I'll free the Colonel, and then see
about you. Just cool your heels a bit, my little man."

Moving over to the Colonel, Freddy took the gag away and freed the
senior officer's hands and feet. It wasn't until he was completely free
that the Intelligence chief was able to speak.

"I'll never forget this, Farmer, never!" he exclaimed in a rush of
words. "One of the finest things I ever saw in my life. I can hardly
believe it even now. It--well, it was like magic. It must have been.
How in blue blazes did you manage to free your hands? Mine were tied so
tight they still feel broken in a dozen places."

As the Colonel spoke he rubbed his hands and wrists vigorously. Freddy
blushed to the roots of his hair, but there was a pleased grin on his
lips.

"They tied me pretty tight, too, sir," he said. "But a chap in England
once showed me a trick of holding your hands so that there's still a
little slack no matter how tight they're tied. It doesn't work with
most people. I mean you have to have thin hands, and be able to sort
of fold them up so's they're no thicker than your wrists. Then you can
slide the ropes off, if you work at it long enough. I--well, I was able
to do it. The moaning and the request for a drink was just to get one
of them close enough. I hope you don't think I meant the things I said,
sir."

"Don't worry," the Colonel said, and slapped Freddy on the shoulder.
"You can say anything you want, at any time, and it will always be
okay with me, after this. I mean it! You make me feel like an amateur,
Farmer. It was wonderful. But let's get these two tied up while they're
still listening to the birdies. What a sweet punch you've got, Farmer.
And at your weight, too! You'd keep Joe Louis busy any time. But let's
get at these two, and get going."

Freddy and the Colonel bent over the two prostrate forms and started
roping them up hand and foot. Dave watched for a moment, then made
sounds in his throat.

"Hey!" he shouted. "I'm here, you know!"

Freddy turned his head and looked at him. Bright lights danced in the
English youth's eyes.

"Why, so you are," he murmured, and gave the Colonel a quick wink.
"Just who are you? And when did you come in?"

"Cut the comedy!" Dawson howled. "Get these confounded ropes off me, or
I'll fan your breeches plenty next time I get my hands on you, young
fellow!"

Freddy shrugged, pursed his lips and cocked an eyebrow at the Colonel.

"Bit violent, isn't he?" he grunted. "Think we should let him loose, or
wait a bit until he cools down?"

"I don't know," the Colonel said with a chuckle. "You're the boss. Do
as you think best. Maybe, if he said 'pretty please,' or something."

"Quite," Freddy said, and turned to Dave. "Say 'pretty please,' and
I'll consider it," he grinned.

Dave looked daggers, and pressed his lips tightly together. Freddy
sighed, stood up and started brushing dust off his uniform.

"What do we do now, sir?" he asked, and deliberately turned his back
on Dawson. "Want me to fly you to San Diego, and have somebody come
back for these three? Or--"

"Okay, okay, you win, you sawed off made in England little runt!" Dave
roared. "Pretty please, confound you. Now untie me, for cat's sake."

Freddy walked over to him and leveled a reprimanding finger.

"Such a tone of voice!" he admonished sternly. "Say it nicely, just as
you were taught in school, now."

Dave turned forty different colors of the rainbow, but he finally
managed to swallow his wrath.

"Pretty please," he said. "I will remember this moment always. And I
mean _always_, you cluck!"

Freddy laughed, and in half a minute had Dave free. As he pulled the
last rope loose, he stepped quickly backward and set himself for the
expected rush. But Dave simply rubbed his hands and wrists and glared
at him.

"Relax!" he growled. "I'm going to save this one up, you betcha! And
when the right time comes, will you sing a song and dance a dance for
me! Kidding aside, though, Freddy, that was something. I really mean
it. Boy! Can you always come up with something new! But don't think
that means I'm going to forget, you little bum. My turn will come."

Freddy grinned at him impishly, and then both stopped their horse play
and turned serious eyes toward the Colonel.

"We can still make San Diego with time to spare, sir," Dave said with a
glance at his watch. "Are we going to take those two along with us?"

"We certainly are," the Colonel said, and pointed a finger at the
pilot. "That one is just ripe to be cracked wide open. He'll blab
everything he knows to save his own neck. I've met his type often. Hard
as nails on the surface, but completely yellow underneath."

"It's pretty hard to believe that a couple of Americans would stoop
this low," Dave said, tight-lipped. "But I suppose the Axis has a fifth
column working here in the States just as they had in every other
country they tackled."

"True enough," the Colonel replied with a nod. "And as the saying
goes, some men will sell their souls for gold. Those two are the type.
Country and flag don't mean a thing to them. Something twisted inside
of them. They weren't put together right in the first place. But this
is a big thing for my bureau, boys! And for the F.B.I., too. I have
a hunch I know who their big boss is--a man the F.B.I.'s been after
for weeks. There'll be a welcoming committee waiting for him tonight.
Have no fear of that. Before we get going, however, I want to have a
quick look around here. Give me a hand. Maybe we'll find something of
importance. We've got an hour or so, haven't we?"

"Easy," Dave replied. "Shall we hunt for something special?"

"Hunt for anything!" the Colonel said grimly. "And pray for a miracle
find."

Exactly one hour and six minutes later they had finished going over
the room with fine tooth comb thoroughness. The net result was a batch
of papers that the Colonel clutched in his hand. A couple of them had
lists of names and addresses. The others were covered with messages
that were all in code, and couldn't be broken down right at the moment.
The Colonel was pleased with the results, but there was just the
slightest gleam of disappointment in his eyes. Dave saw the gleam and
wondered.

"We didn't find the miracle, sir?" he asked. "What was it?"

The Colonel tapped the papers and shook his head.

"It could be in this stuff, but I doubt it," he said. "I mean a clue
that would help us with the Carrier Indian business. However, I don't
think--"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence suddenly stopped, and a cold hard
glint came into his eyes. He turned around and stared down at the two
trussed up men on the floor. Both had recovered consciousness and were
watching him out of eyes brimming with terror. The Colonel eyed them
for a moment, then stepped forward and deliberately picked up one of
the two automatics Freddy had placed on the table. Turning, he sighted
the gun and pulled the trigger. The gun roared sound and flame. A hole
appeared in the floor a half inch from the redhead's left ear, and the
man screamed like a stuck pig. Colonel Welsh leveled the gun again and
drilled a hole in the floor a half inch from the redhead's other ear.

"See?" he barked. "I know a little about trick shooting, myself. Okay.
How's this for a bull's-eye? Right between those two. Right on the end
of your nose!"

The man screamed and writhed about on the floor.

"Don't, don't!" he gasped. "Oh, please don't, Colonel! Don't let me
have it."

"Then what about your brother rat aboard the Carrier Indian?" Colonel
Welsh thundered. "Who is he? What name is he using? What's his rank?
Speak up, you! I've got an itchy trigger finger, too!"

The redhead gasped, and gurgled, and choked, and sobbed in a desperate
effort to get the words out of his mouth in a hurry.

"I don't know, I don't know!" he cried. "We don't know anything about
the Carrier Indian. Honestly, we don't, Colonel. We just got orders
to stop you and these two kids from getting to San Diego. We only got
orders to stop them from going aboard the Indian. We don't know nothing
about her, honest to Pete. We don't even know why our boss didn't want
them two kids to go aboard. That's the truth, on my word of honor."

"You have no honor!" the Colonel told him coldly. Then he slowly
sighted the gun on a point between the pilot's eyes. "Well?" he
demanded. "You tell me then!"

The pilot turned white as a sheet under his beard, and looked as if he
were going to faint. His eyes popped way out, and spittle drooled out
the corners of his mouth.

"I don't know either!" he cried hoarsely. "So help me, Colonel, I'm
willing to spill everything I know. But I don't know a thing about the
Indian business. Go on, shoot me right between the eyes if I'm telling
you any lie. We just manned this station. And like he said, we got
orders to stop those two from going aboard the Indian. So help me!
That's the truth!"

Colonel Welsh hesitated, then shrugged and stuck the gun in his pocket.

"It was too much to hope for, anyway," he muttered more to himself.
"Let's get going. You lads get the plane started while I lug these two
outside. A mighty big day for America so far. Now, if only you two
can--"

The senior officer sighed and let the rest hang in the air. Then he
bent over, caught each man by the heels, and hauled them out into the
brilliant sunshine like a couple of logs. They yelped and babbled with
pain, but the Colonel had deaf ears. Twenty minutes later the two fifth
column prisoners were stowed aboard the Stinson, and the plane's props
were ticking over. Dave and Freddy had refilled the tanks from tins of
gas they found in the second shack. The shiny thing that Dave had seen
under the trees from the air proved to be a high speed Waco fitted with
two machine guns. For a moment they debated whether or not one of them
should fly it back. On second thought, though, they decided it was best
for them all to stick together in the same ship, and let somebody else
pick up the Waco later.

"Okay, all aboard!" Dave finally announced, and gave Freddy a friendly
slap on the back. "Go on and fly her, pal. You've sure earned the
honor. And, heck, my nerves can stand anything, now."

"I knew the compliment would have a nasty ending to it!" the English
youth growled, and shook his head. "No, fly her yourself. I've done my
share of work today. Besides, you know this neck of the world. I don't."

"Well, somebody fly it!" Colonel Welsh shouted from inside the cabin.
"We've still got to get to San Diego, you know. Come on, snap it up,
you two!"

"Okay!" Dave growled, and shouldered Freddy Farmer out of the way. "If
I must I must. Who was your slave last year, Mister?"

"Same chap," Freddy said with a chuckle. "And his good manners haven't
improved a bit. San Diego, my good man! And in a bit of a hurry,
please!"

"Very good, sir!" Dave grunted and made a face. "And you can guess what
I'm _thinking_!"




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

_Death Strikes Often_


A huge ball of gold and red hung balanced on the western lip of
the world. Shafts of shimmering fire radiated out from it in all
directions. They filled the sky with a mixture of shades that ranged
from a delicate pink to blood red. They bathed the earth with the same
hues, and seemed actually to creep into every nook and corner. The line
of planes on the San Diego field looked like the work of an imaginative
artist on nature's canvas rather than the real thing. It was a sight
to hold the eye and catch the breath--but Dave Dawson stared at it and
wasn't even conscious of what he was looking at.

He and Freddy Farmer were in the field Commandant's office, waiting for
Colonel Welsh to show up. But that was just the trouble. They had been
waiting for three solid hours for the Intelligence chief to return from
wherever he had gone. Three hours before Dave had put the Stinson down
on the field. At Colonel Welsh's order he had taxied it straight into
an empty hangar and cut the engines. The Colonel had jumped out and
disappeared for five minutes. He had returned with the field's C.O. and
a half dozen mechanics, and a closed car. The two fifth columnists had
been dumped in the car, and driven away. After hasty introductions to
the field Commandant, the Colonel had led them over to the field office
and told them to wait for him to return.

That had been three hours ago, and they were still waiting.

"Stop worrying, and come finish this food they sent over," Freddy
Farmer presently broke the silence. "Good grief, Dave, it doesn't do
any good to wear out the floor like that. Come on and have some more to
eat. Eggs, mind you! I haven't had an egg since I don't know when."

"You and your stomach!" Dave grated, and half turned from the window.
"You should choke on them. Look out there. The Indian! If they're
not getting ready to weigh anchor, then I'm nuts! Where is that guy,
anyway? He should have told us that--Jeepers!"

Freddy stopped some egg halfway to his mouth and looked up.

"What?" he demanded. "What's the matter?"

"The Colonel," Dave said with an effort. "I mean--I sure hope nothing's
happened to him."

Freddy Farmer considered that for a moment, then shrugged and carried
the egg the rest of the way to his mouth.

"Not likely, I think," he finally said. "Probably got those two chaps
to talk. Maybe it's made a difference. I mean, maybe he's decided to
call off this Indian show. Wouldn't mind that at all. They might post
us here at this field. Wonderful food, you know."

"It certainly _sounds_ good!" Dave cracked. Then, glancing out the
window again: "I sure hope they don't call off the show. That Indian
looks pretty nice to me out there. I could go for a trip on her.
Besides, I'm itching to take a whack or six at those dirty Japs. I
think I hate them worse than the Nazis, Freddy."

"Me, too, if that's possible," the English youth replied. "But I was
really talking just to hear myself. I'd like a trip on the Indian,
too. She's the latest of her class, and should have everything. Also,
according to the Colonel, she's steaming out to do battle. I could
fancy a little combat work. Doesn't pay to get rusty. My, but that meal
was good!"

"What a man!" Dave sighed at the window. "On an empty stomach he's not
worth a dime. Fill him up and he's a one man air force, and raring to
go. He's--"

Dave stopped short and wheeled quickly as the door opened and Colonel
Welsh came inside. The man's face was grim, and there was the look of
angry defeat in his eyes.

"Sorry I took so long, fellows," he said, and dropped into a chair. "I
had to check up on a few things, and get a few things underway. Took
longer than I figured."

"Those rats told the truth, eh?" Dave grunted. "They still don't know a
thing about the Indian?"

The Colonel shook his head and clenched his two fists in a helpless
gesture.

"Not a thing!" he got out savagely. "But they seem to be the only two
who don't."

"What do you mean by that, sir?" Freddy asked.

"Well, I don't mean it exactly the way I put it," the Colonel said with
a shake of his head. "But it seems the entire Axis organization in this
country has found out that their agent aboard the Indian has stolen the
battle plans of the carrier, and that I was to put four men aboard to
try and trap him and nail him to the mast. Those two agents of mine,
and you two."

"Your two agents got aboard last night, sir?" Dave prompted as the
senior officer stopped talking abruptly.

"No," was the bitter reply. "They were shot and killed as they stepped
into the waiting tender at the Navy pier."

"Shot?" Dave gasped. "Gee! That was tough. I hope the killers were
caught."

"They were, and captured dead," the Colonel said bluntly. "Two
waterfront rats. Looked that, anyway. One a Jap, obviously. The other
looked like a German. No papers or anything on him, though. So he could
have been almost any nationality. But the important thing is, that I
found the leak in my own organization. I put through a call to Captain
Lamb and he told me. He'd sent word to our San Diego office last night
for me to contact him at once. I called him, and--"

"The bloke reading the book in your outer office!" Freddy Farmer cried.

"The man who ran the elevator!" Dave exclaimed.

Colonel Welsh caught his breath and shot a hard look at Dawson.

"How did you know?" he demanded.

"I didn't," Dave replied. "But I had a hunch it might be one of those
two. It had to be somebody close to you, and--well, Freddy had already
picked the one in the outer office."

"It was the one who brought you up in the elevator," Colonel Welsh
said with an effort. "It's--it's things like this that almost make me
lose faith. That man had been in the bureau for six years. For four
years before that he was connected with Secret Service. His record was
spotless. And the amazing part is that he had performed some valuable
services for me. But that goes to show you the finesse of the Gestapo
and Nazi agent technique. Shows you how long ago Hitler laid plans for
America. I would have staked my life on Babson, but--"

The officer paused and gestured despairingly.

"But of course I would have lost my life!" he suddenly bit off. "But
for an accident I'd never have found out, perhaps. And who knows what
else that would have cost us? He was taking Lamb down late last night.
As he opened the doors a slip of paper fell out of his pocket. Lamb
caught it in mid-air, and was starting to hand it back when he saw
what was on the paper. It was a bit of code, obviously jotted down in
a hurry. But it was a code that only Lamb and I knew, not another
soul in the world. For years he and I have been working on a code that
can't possibly be broken down by any of the experts. We thought we had
found it. Kept our papers on it in a safe. Only Lamb and I knew the
combination--we thought."

"What happened, sir?" Freddy asked eagerly as Colonel Welsh let his
voice trail off into silence. "Did Captain Lamb make the dirty beggar
confess?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence shook his head.

"He didn't have time," he said. "Babson realized instantly that he'd
never in the world be able to explain his possession of that bit of
copied code. His only hope was quick action, and flight. He went for
his gun. Lamb didn't give me the details of the fight. He won, and
Babson is dead. Then Lamb got busy. He began with the little office
Babson used on the ground floor. He--It seems incredible! I thought
that Lamb was crazy, or blind drunk, and making it up. But he wasn't,
of course. Babson had actually installed a dictograph in our working
room. The other end was in his office. The wire led out behind the
files, under the corridor boards and down the elevator shaft, and
under the lobby floor to his office. He could hear every word we said
up there. How he learned that safe combination, we'll probably never
find out. In his Washington hotel room Lamb found enough stuff to hang
the man a dozen times over. Too bad we won't be able to do it. I feel
like going out and shooting myself. I'm the one responsible, of course.
One of my own trusted men! That's the worst of it!"

The Colonel gave a bewildered shake of his head, and groaned heavily.

"That's war, I guess," Dave murmured sympathetically. "And the same
thing has happened in other countries, sir. It isn't going to help any
to take it too hard, you know. Anyway, the rat is dead, and the leak is
plugged up. That's something, at least."

"But mighty little!" the Colonel said bitterly. Then, stabbing a
finger at the window facing the harbor, he grated, "There's the Indian
out there. In an hour she weighs anchor. Aboard her is the most
dangerous rat of all. He possesses information that could well mean the
difference between victory and defeat if it falls into Jap hands. We
can't hold the Indian. She's got to sail. Without her the whole battle
plan is mixed up. Yet if she sails and we don't catch that scoundrel,
who knows what will happen? I had hoped, but--well, now that's all
shot, too."

"What's all shot, sir?" Dave asked quickly.

"The job I had planned for you and Farmer aboard the Indian," the
Colonel replied. "It was a wild hope even at best, but now it isn't
even that. The rats know why I wanted you two aboard her. True, maybe
the man you're after doesn't know. I've a feeling, though, he does.
The way things have gone, I feel certain they got word to him somehow.
If they did, he'd know exactly why you were there the moment you came
over the side. And--well, to put it bluntly, he's killed twice already.
Twice more wouldn't bother him if he suspected you were getting close
to him. He'd--"

"We can watch our step," Dave cut in grimly.

"Too great a risk," the Colonel replied. "You see, it wouldn't be a
matter of your actually getting close, but the matter of his _thinking_
that you _were_ close. He'd know who you were, and why you were aboard.
The advantage would be all his. It would be unfair to ask any man to
tackle a job like that."

"I don't fancy so, sir," Freddy Farmer spoke up quietly. "After all,
rats usually do have all the advantage until you get them cornered.
Supposing he does know why we're there? Let him, I say. It's a job to
be done, and somebody's got to tackle it, sir. Good grief! If somebody
doesn't go after the blighter, it's like letting the Indian sail with a
lighted fuse leading to her powder magazine."

"I check on that, too, sir!" Dave cried eagerly. "Freddy and I aren't
trying to toot our horns, Colonel. Maybe we'll fall flat on our faces.
But maybe we won't. However, at least we'll be aboard in case something
does turn up that gives us a clue."

"Yes, of course," the Colonel grunted, and frowned. "That's quite true.
But you could be throwing your lives away--and uselessly, too. You two
helped accomplish something almost as big today, perhaps even bigger. I
can't say yet. But capturing those two American born rats was a mighty
big step toward smashing a lot of the Fifth Column business in this
country. I mean that, too. That place was one of their arsenals where
they've cached guns to be used when Berlin sends the order to strike
at the United States from within. It's one of several arsenals located
about the country. Those papers contained names and addresses of key
men in their organization. And right now some of my agents, and F.B.I.
agents, are waiting in that shack for the so-called big boss. His
capture alone will be something mighty big. Yes, you two played a major
part today in nipping something big in the bud. So it isn't fair to ask
you to--"

"Okay, okay!" Dave suddenly snapped. "If you don't think we rate a
crack at it, then have the Indian sail without us. I'm willing to take
the chance. So's Freddy. But if you think we'd mess up things, then
skip it. Let it slide."

The Colonel blinked and gave Dave a startled look. It wasn't every datian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of J
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
002:046 It happened after three days they found him in the temple,
        sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them,
        and asking them questions.
002:047 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
002:048 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother
        said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way?prophet.
013:021 Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son
        of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty yearf heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond treshall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
        or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken
        at the cistern,
012:007 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
        returns to God who gave it.
012:008 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
012:009 Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge.  Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set
        in order many proverbs.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
No, mortals blended by terror! The friend of nature is not your enemy;
its interpreter is not the minister of falsehood; the destroyer of your
vain phantoms is not the devastator of those truths necessary to your
happiness; the disciple of reason is not an irrational being, who either
seeks to poison you, or to infect you with a dangerous delirium. If
he is desirous to wrest the thunder from those terrible theories that
affright ye, it is that ye way discontinue your march, in the midst
of storms, over roads that ye can only distinguish by the sudden, but
evanescent glimmerings of the electric fluid. If he breaks those idols,
which fear has served with myrrh and frankencense--which superstition
has surrounded by gloomy despondency--which fanaticism has imbrued with
blood; it is to substitute in their place those consoling truths that
are calculated to heal the desperate wounds ye have received; that are
suitable to inspire you with courage, sturdily to oppose yourselves
to such dangerous errors; that have power to enable you to resist such
formidable enemies. If he throws down the temples, overturns the altars,
so frequently bathed with the bitter tears of the unfortunate, blackened
by the most cruel sacrifices, smoked with servile incense, it is that he
may erect a fane sacred to peace; a hall dedicated to reason; a durable
monument to virtue, in which ye may at all times find an asylum against
your own phrenzy; a refuge from your own ungovernable passions; a
sanctuary against those powerful dogmatists, by whom ye are oppressed.
If he attacks the haughty pretensions of deified tyrants, who crush ye
with an iron sceptre, it is that ye may enjoy the rights of your nature;
it is to the end that ye may be substantively freemen, in mind as well
as in body; that ye may not be slaves, eternally chained to the oar of
misery; it is that ye may at length be governed by men who are citizens,
who may cherish their own semblances, who way protect mortals like
themselves, who may actually consult the interests of those from
whom they hold their power. If he battles with imposture, it is to
re-establish truth in those rights which have been so long usurped by
fiction. If he undermines the base of that unsteady, fanatical morality,
which has hitherto done nothing more than perplex your minds, without
correcting your hearts; it is to give to ethics an immovable basis, a
solid foundation, secured upon your own nature; upon the reciprocity of
those wants which are continually regenerating in sensible beings: dare,
then, to listen to his voice; you will find it much more intelligible
than those ambiguous oracles, which are announced to you as the
offspring of capricious theories; as imperious decrees that are
unceasingly at variance with themselves. Listen then to nature, she
never contradicts her own eternal laws.

"O thou!" cries this nature to man, "who, following the impulse I
have given you, during your whole existence, incessantly tend towards
happiness, do not strive to resist my sovereign law. Labour to your own
felicity; partake without fear of the banquet which is spread before
you, with the most hearty welcome; you will find the means legibly
written on your own heart. Vainly dost thou, O superstitious being! seek
after thine happiness beyond the limits of the universe, in which my
hand hath placed thee: vainly shalt thou search it in those inexorable
theories, which thine imagination, ever prone to wander, would establish
upon my eternal throne: vainly dost thou expect it in those fanciful
regions, to which thine own delirium hath given a locality and a shame:
vainly dost thou reckon upon capricious systems, with whose advantages
thou art in such ecstasies; whilst they only fill thine abode with
calamity--thine heart with dread--thy mind with illusions--thy bosom
with groans. Know that when thou neglectest my counsels, the gods will
refuse their aid. Dare, then, to affranchise thyself from the trammels
of superstition, my self-conceited, pragmatic rival, who mistakes
my rights; renounce those empty theories, which are usurpers of my
privileges; return under the dominion of my laws, which, however severe,
are mild in comparison with those of bigotry. It is in my empire
alone that true liberty reigns. Tyranny is unknown to its soil; equity
unceasingly watches over the rights of all my subjects, maintains
them in the possession of their just claims; benevolence, grafted upon
humanity, connects them by amicable bonds; truth enlightens them; never
can imposture blind them with his obscuring mists. Return, then,
my child, to thy fostering mother's arms! Deserter, trace back thy
wandering steps to nature! She will console thee for thine evils; she
will drive from thine heart those appalling fears which overwhelm thee;
those inquietudes that distract thee; those transports which agitate
thee; those hatreds that separate thee from thy fellow man, whom thou
shouldst love as thyself. Return to nature, to humanity, to thyself!
Strew flowers over the road of life: cease to contemplate the future;
live to thine own happiness; exist for thy fellow creatures; retire into
thyself, examine thine own heart, then consider the sensitive beings by
whom thou art surrounded: leave to their inventors those systems which
can effect nothing towards thy felicity. Enjoy thyself, and cause others
also to enjoy, those comforts which I have placed with a liberal hand,
for all the children of the earth; who all equally emanate from my
bosom: assist them to support the sorrows to which necessity has
submitted them in common with thyself. Know, that I approve thy
pleasures, when without injuring thyself, they are not fatal to thy
brethren, whom I have rendered indispensably necessary to thine own
individual happiness. These pleasures are freely permitted thee, if thou
indulgest them with moderation; with that discretion which I myself have
fixed. Be happy, then, O man! Nature invites thee to participate in it;
but always remember, thou canst not be so alone; because I invite all
mortals to happiness as well as thyself; thou will find it is only in
securing their felicity that thou canst consolidate thine own. Such is
the decree of thy destiny: if thou shalt attempt to withdraw thyself
from its operation, recollect that hatred will pursue thee; vengeance
overtake thy steps; and remorse be ever ready at hand to punish the
infractions of its irrevocable mandates.

"Follow then, O man! in whatever station thou findest thyself, the
routine I have described for thee, to obtain that happiness to which
thou hast an indispensable right to challenge pretension. Let the
sensations of humanity interest thee for the condition of other men, who
are thy fellow creatures; let thine heart have commisseration for their
misfortunes: let thy generous hand spontaneously stretch forth to lend
succour to the unhappy mortal who is overwhelmed by his destiny; always
bearing in thy recollection, that it may fall heavy upon thyself, as
it now does upon him. Acknowledge, then, without guile, that every
unfortunate has an inalienable right to thy kindness. Above all, wipe
from the eyes of oppressed innocence the trickling crystals of agonized
feeling; let the tears of virtue in distress, fall upon thy sympathizing
bosom; let the genial glow of sincere friendship animate thine honest
heart; let the fond attachment of a mate, cherished by thy warmest
affection, make thee forget the sorrows of life: be faithful to her
love, responsible to her tenderness, that she may reward thee by
a reciprocity of feeling; that under the eyes of parents united in
virtuous esteem, thy offspring may learn to set a proper value on
practical virtue; that after having occupied thy riper years, they may
comfort thy declining age, gild with content thy setting sun, cheer the
evening of thine existence, by a dutiful return of that care which thou
shalt have bestowed on their imbecile infancy.

"Be just, because equity is the support of human society! Be good,
because goodness connects all hearts in adamantine bonds! Be indulgent,
because feeble thyself, thou livest with beings who partake of thy
weakness! Be gentle, because mildness attracts attention! Be thankful,
because gratitude feeds benevolence, nourishes generosity! Be modest,
because haughtiness is disgusting to beings at all times well with
themselves. Forgive injuries, because revenge perpetuates hatred! Do
good to him who injureth thee, in order to shew thyself more noble than
he is; to make a friend of him, who was once thine enemy! Be reserved
in thy demeanor, temperate in thine enjoyment, chaste in thy pleasures,
because voluptuousness begets weariness, intemperance engenders disease;
forward manners are revolting: excess at all times relaxes the springs
of thy machine, will ultimately destroy thy being, and render thee
hateful to thyself, contemptible to others.

"Be a faithful citizen; because the community is necessary to thine own
security; to the enjoyment of thine own existence; to the furtherance
of thine own happiness. Be loyal, but be brave; submit to legitimate
authority; because it is requisite to the maintenance of that society
which is necessary to thyself. Be obedient to the laws; because they
_are_, or _ought to be_, the expression of the public will, to which
thine own particular will ought ever to be subordinate. Defend thy
country with zeal; because it is that which renders thee happy, which
contains thy property, as well as those beings dearest to thine heart:
do not permit this common parent of thyself, as well as of thy fellow
citizens, to fall under the shackles of tyranny; because from thence
it will be no more than thy common prison. If thy country, deaf to the
equity of thy claims, refuses thee happiness--if, submitted to an unjust
power, it suffers thee to be oppressed, withdraw thyself from its bosom
in silence, but never disturb its peace.

"In short, be a man; be a sensible, rational being; be a faithful
husband; a tender father; an equitable master; a zealous citizen; labour
to serve thy country by thy prowess; by thy talents; by thine industry;
above all, by thy virtues. Participate with thine associates those gifts
which nature has bestowed upon thee; diffuse happiness, among thy fellow
mortals; inspire thy fellow citizens with content; spread joy over all
those who approach thee, that the sphere of thine actions, enlivened by
thy kindness, illumined by thy benevolence, may re-act upon thyself; be
assured that the man who makes others happy cannot himself be miserable.
In thus conducting thyself, whatever may be the injustice of others,
whatever may be the blindness of those beings with whom it is thy
destiny to live, thou wilt never be totally bereft of the recompense
which is thy due; no power on earth be able to ravish from thee that
never failing source of the purest felicity, inward content; at each
moment thou wilt fall back with pleasure upon thyself; thou wilt neither
feel the rankling of shame, the terror of internal alarm, nor find
thy heart corroded by remorse. Thou wilt esteem thyself; thou wilt be
cherished by the virtuous, applauded and loved by all good men, whose
suffrages are much more valuable than those of the bewildered
multitude. Nevertheless, if externals occupy thy contemplation, smiling
countenances will greet thy presence; happy faces will express the
interest they have in thy welfare; jocund beings will make thee
participate in their placid feelings. A life so spent, will each moment
be marked by the serenity of thine own soul, by the affection of the
beings who environ thee; will be made cheerful by the friendship of thy
fellows; will enable thee to rise a contented, satisfied guest from the
general feast; conduct thee gently down the declivity of life, lead thee
peaceably to the period of thy days; for die thou must: but already
thou wilt survive thyself in thought; thou wilt always live in the
remembrance of thy friends; in the grateful recollection of those beings
whose comforts have been augmented by thy friendly attentions; thy
virtues will, beforehand have erected to thy fame an imperishable
monument: if heaven occupies itself with thee, it will feel satisfied
with thy conduct, when it shall thus have contented the earth.

"Beware, then, how thou complainest of thy condition; be just, be kind,
be virtuous, and thou canst never be wholly destitute of felicity. Take
heed how thou enviest the transient pleasure of seductive crime; the
deceitful power of victorious tyranny; the specious tranquillity of
interested imposture; the plausible manners of venal justice; the shewy,
ostentatious parade of hardened opulence. Never be tempted to increase
the number of sycophants to an ambitious despot; to swell the catalogue
of slaves to an unjust tyrant; never suffer thyself to be allured to
infamy, to the practice of extortion, to the commission of outrage, by
the fatal privilege of oppressing thy fellows; always recollect it will
be at the expence of the most bitter remorse thou wilt acquire this
baneful advantage. Never be the mercenary accomplice of the spoilers of
thy country; they are obliged to blush secretly whenever they meet the
public eye.

"For, do not deceive thyself, it is I who punish, with an unerring hand,
all the crimes of the earth; the wicked may escape the laws of man, but
they never escape mine. It is I who have formed the hearts, as well
an the bodies of mortals; it is I who have fixed the laws which govern
them. If thou deliverest thyself up to voluptuous enjoyment, the
companions of thy debaucheries may applaud thee; but I shall punish thee
with the most cruel infirmities; these will terminate a life of shame
with deserved contempt. If thou givest, thyself up to intemperate
indulgences, human laws may not correct thee, but I shall castigate thee
severely by abridging thy days. If thou art vicious, thy fatal habits
will recoil on thine own head. Princes, those terrestrial divinities,
whose power places them above the laws of mankind, are nevertheless
obliged to tremble under the silent operation of my decrees. It is I who
chastise them; it is I who fill their breasts with suspicion; it is
I who inspire them with terror; it is I who make them writhe under
inquietude; it is I who make them shudder with horror, at the very name
of august truth; it is I who, amidst the crowd of nobles who surround
them, make them feel the inward workings of shame; the keen anguish of
guilt; the poisoned arrows of regret; the cruel stings of remorse; it is
I who, when they abuse my bounty, diffuse weariness over their benumbed
souls; it is I who follow uncreated, eternal justice; it is I who,
without distinction of persons, know how to make the balance even; to
adjust the chastisement to the fault; to make the misery bear its due
proportion to the depravity; to inflict punishment commensurate with the
crime. The laws of man are just, only when they are in conformity with
mine; his judgements are rational, only when I have dictated them: my
laws alone are immutable, universal, irrefragable; formed to regulate
the condition of the human race, in all ages, in all places, under all
circumstances.

"If thou doubtest mine authority, if thou questionest the irresistible
power I possess over mortals, contemplate the vengeance I wreak on all
those who resist my decrees. Dive into the recesses of the hearts of
those various criminals, whose countenances, assuming a forced smile,
cover souls torn with anguish. Dost thou not behold ambition tormented
day and night, with an ardour which nothing can extinguish? Dost not
thou see the mighty conquerer become the lord of devastated solitudes;
his victorious career, marked by a blasted cultivation, reign
sorrowfully over smoking ruins; govern unhappy wretches who curse him in
their hearts; while his soul, gnawed by remorse, sickens at the gloomy
aspect of his own triumphs? Dost thou believe that the tyrant, encircled
with his flatterers, who stun him with their praise, is unconscious of
the hatred which his oppression excites; of the contempt which his vices
draw upon him; of the sneers which his inutility call forth; of the
scorn which his debaucheries entail upon his name? Dost thou think that
the haughty courtier does not inwardly blush at the galling insults he
brooks; despise, from the bottom of his soul, those meannesses by
which he is compelled to purchase favours; feel at his heart's core the
wretched dependence in which his cupidity places him.

"Contemplate the indolent child of wealth, behold him a prey to the
lassitude of unmeasured enjoyment, corroded by the satiety which always
follows his exhausted pleasures. View the miser with an emaciated
countenance, the consequence of his own penurious disposition, whose
callous heart is inaccessible to the calls of misery, groaning over the
accumulating load of useless treasure, which at the expense of himself,
he has laboured to amass. Behold the gay voluptuary, the smiling
debaucheé, secretly lament the health they have so inconsiderately
damaged so prodigally thrown away: see disdain, joined to hatred, reign
between those adulterous married couples, who have reciprocally violated
the sacred vows they mutually pledged at the altar of Hymen; whose
appetencies have rendered them the scorn of the world; the jest of their
acquaintance; polluted tributaries to the surgeon. See the liar
deprived of all confidence; the knave stript of all trust; the hypocrite
fearfully avoiding the penetrating looks of his inquisitive neighbour;
the impostor trembling at the very name of formidable truth. Bring under
your review the heart of the envious, uselessly dishonored; that withers
at the sight of his neighbour's prosperity. Cast your eyes on the frozen
soul of the ungrateful wretch, whom no kindness can warm, no benevolence
thaw, no beneficence convert into a genial fluid. Survey the iron
feelings of that monster whom the sighs of the unfortunate cannot
mollify. Behold the revengeful being nourished with venemous gall, whose
very thoughts are serpents; who in his rage consumes himself. Envy, if
thou canst, the waking slumbers of the homicide; the startings of the
iniquitous judge; the restlessness of the oppressor of innocence; the
fearful visions of the extortioner; whose couches are infested with the
torches of the furies. Thou tremblest without doubt at the sight of
that distraction which, amidst their splendid luxuries, agitates those
farmers of the revenue, who fatten upon public calamnity--who devour the
substance of the orphan--who consume the means of the widow--who grind
the hard earnings of the poor: thou shudderest at witnessing the remorse
which rends the souls of those reverend criminals, whom the uninformed
believe to be happy, whilst the contempt which they have for themselves,
the unerring shafts of secret upbraidings, are incessantly revenging
an outraged nation. Thou seest, that content is for ever banished the
heart; quiet for ever driven from the habitations of those miserable
wretches on whose minds I have indelibly engraved the scorn, the infamy,
the chastisement which they deserve. But, no! thine eyes cannot sustain
the tragic spectacle of my vengeance. Humanity obliges thee to partake
of their merited sufferings; thou art moved to pity for these unhappy
people, to whom consecrated errors renders vice necessary; whose fatal
habits make them familiar with crime. Yes; thou shunnest them without
hating them; thou wouldst succour them, if their contumacious perversity
had left thee the means. When thou comparest thine own condition, when
thou examinest thine own soul, thou wilt have just cause to felicitate
thyself, if thou shalt find that peace has taken up her abode with thee;
that contentment dwells at the bottom of thine own heart. In short, thou
seest accomplished upon them, as well as, upon thyself, the unalterable
decrees of destiny, which imperiously demand, that crime shall punish
itself, that virtue never shall be destitute Of remuneration."

Such is the sum of those truths which are contained in the _Code of
Nature_; such are the doctrines, which its disciples can announce. They
are unquestionably preferable to that supernatural superstition which
never does any thing but mischief to the human species. Such is the
worship that is taught by that sacred reason, which is the object of
contempt with the theologian; which meets the insult of the fanatic;
who only estimates that which man can neither conceive nor practise; who
make his morality consist in fictitious duties; his virtue in actions
generally useless, frequently pernicious to the welfare of society; who
for want of being acquainted with nature, which is before their eyes,
believe themselves obliged to seek in ideal worlds imaginary motives, of
which every thing proves the inefficacy. The motive which the morality
of nature employs, is the self-evident interest of each individual,
of each community, of the whole human species, in all times, in every
country, under all circumstances. Its worship is the sacrifice of vice,
the practise of real virtues; its object is the conservation of the
human race, the happiness of the individual, the peace of mankind;
its recompences are affection, esteem, and glory; or in their default,
contentment of mind, with merited self-esteem, of which no power will
ever be able to deprive virtuous mortals; its punishments, are hatred,
contempt, and indignation; which society always reserves for those
who outrage its interests; from which even the most powerful can never
effectually shield themselves.

Those nations who shall be disposed to practise a morality so wise, who
shall inculcate it in infancy, whose laws shall unceasingly confirm it,
will neither have occasion for superstition, nor for chimeras. Those
who shall obstinately prefer figments to their dearest interests, will
certainly march forward to ruin. If they maintain themselves for a
season, it is because the power of nature sometimes drives them back to
reason, in despite of those prejudices which appear to lead them on to
certain destruction. Superstition, leagued with tyranny, for the waste
of the human species, are themselves frequently obliged to implore
the assistance of a reason which they contemn; of a nature which they
disdain; which they debase; which they endeavour to crush under the
ponderous bulk of artificial theories. Superstition, in all times so
fatal to mortals, when attacked by reason, assumes the sacred mantle of
public utility; rests its importance on false grounds, founds its
rights upon the indissoluble alliance which it pretends subsists between
morality and itself; notwithstanding it never ceases for a single
instant to wage against it the most cruel hostility. It is,
unquestionably, by this artifice, that it has seduced so many sages.
In the honesty of their hearts, they believe it useful to politics;
necessary to restrain the ungovernable fury of the passions; thus
hypocritical superstition, in order to mask to superficial observers,
its own hideous character, like the ass with the lion's skin, always
knows how to cover itself with the sacred armour of utility; to buckle
on the invulnerable shield of virtue; it has therefore, been believed
imperative to respect it, notwithstanding it felt awkward under these
incumbrances; it consequently has become a duty to favor imposture,
because it has artfully entrenched itself behind the altars of truth;
its ears, however, discover its worthlessness; its natural cowardice
betrays itself; it is from this intrenchment we ought to drive it; it
should be dragged forth to public view; stripped of its surreptitious
panoply; exposed in its native deformity; in order that the human race
may become acquainted with its dissimulation; that mankind may have a
knowledge of its crimes; that the universe may behold its sacrilegious
hands, armed with homicidal poniards, stained with the blood of nations,
whom it either intoxicates with its fury, or immolates without pity to
the violence of its passions.

The MORALITY OF NATURE is the only creed which her interpreter offers to
his fellow citizens; to nations; to the human species; to future races,
weaned from those prejudices which have so frequently disturbed the
felicity of their ancestors. The friend of mankind cannot be the friend
of delusion, which at all times has been a real scourge to the earth.
The APOSTLE OF NATURE will not be the instrument of deceitful chimeras,
by which this world is made only an abode of illusions; the adorer of
truth will not compromise with falsehood; he will make no covenant with
error; conscious it must always be fatal to mortals. He knows that the
happiness of the human race imperiously exacts that the dark unsteady
edifice of superstition should be razed to its foundations; in order
to elevate on its ruins a temple suitable to peace--a fane sacred to
virtue. He feels it is only by extirpating, even to the most slender
fibres, the poisonous tree, that during so many ages has overshadowed
the universe, that the inhabitants of this world will be able to use
their own optics--to bear with steadiness that light which is competent
to illumine their understanding--to guide their wayward steps--to give
the necessary ardency to their souls. If his efforts should be vain; if
he cannot inspire with courage, beings too much accustomed to tremble;
he will, at least, applaud himself for having dared the attempt.
Nevertheless, he will not judge his exertions fruitless, if he has
only been enabled to make a single mortal happy: if his principles have
calmed the conflicting transports of one honest soul; if his reasonings
have cheered up some few virtuous hearts. At least he will have the
advantage of having banished from his own mind the importunate terror
of superstition; of having expelled from his own heart the gall which
exasperates zeal; of having trodden under foot those chimeras with which
the uninformed are tormented. Thus, escaped from the peril of the storm,
he will calmly contemplate from the summit of his rock, those tremendous
hurricanes which superstition excites; he will hold forth a succouring
hand to those who shall be willing to accept it; he will encourage them
with his voice; he will second them with his best exertions, and in the
warmth of his own compassionate heart, he will exclaim:

O NATURE; sovereign of all beings! and ye, her adorable daughters,
VIRTUE, REASON, and TRUTH! remain for ever our revered protectors: it is
to you that belong the praises of the human race; to you appertains the
homage of the earth. Shew, us then, O NATURE! that which man ought
to do, in order to obtain the happiness which thou makest him desire.
VIRTUE! Animate him with thy beneficent fire. REASON! Conduct his
uncertain steps through the paths of life. TRUTH! Let thy torch illumine
his intellect, dissipate the darkness of his road. Unite, O assisting
deities! your powers, in order to submit the hearts of mankind to
your dominion. Banish error from our mind; wickedness from our hearts;
confusion from our footsteps; cause knowledge to extend its salubrious
reign; goodness to occupy our souls; serenity to dwell in our bosoms.
Let imposture, confounded, never again dare to shew its head. Let our
eyes, so long, either dazzled or blindfolded, be at length fixed
upon those objects we ought to seek. Dispel for ever those mists
of ignorance, those hideous phantoms, together with those seducing
chimeras, which only serve to lead us astray. Extricate us from that
dark abyss into which we are plunged by superstition; overthrow the
fatal empire of delusion; crumble the throne of falsehood; wrest from
their polluted hands the power they have usurped. Command men, without
sharing your authority with mortals: break the chains that bind them
down in slavery: tear away the bandeau by which they are hoodwinked;
allay the fury that intoxicates them; break in the hands of sanguinary,
lawless tyrants, that iron sceptre with which they are crushed to
exile; the imaginary regions, from whence fear has imported them, those
theories by which they are afflicted. Inspire the intelligent being with
courage; infuse energy into his system, that, at length, he may feel his
own dignity; that he may dare to love himself; to esteem his own actions
when they are worthy; that a slave only to your eternal laws, he may no
longer fear to enfranchise himself from all other trammels; that blest
with freedom, he may have the wisdom to cherish his fellow creature; and
become happy by learning to perfection his own condition; instruct him
in the great lesson, that the high road to felicity, is prudently to
partake himself, and also to cause others to enjoy, the rich banquet
which thou, O Nature! hast so bountifully set before him. Console thy
children for those sorrows to which their destiny submits them, by
those pleasures which wisdom allows them to partake; teach them to be
contented with their condition; to banish envy from their mind; to yield
silently to necessity. Conduct them without alarm to that period which
all beings must find; _let them learn that time changes all things, that
consequently they are made neither to avoid its scythe nor to fear its
arrival._





[TRANSLATOR'S APPENDIX]

A BRIEF SKETCH

OF THE

LIFE AND WRITINGS

OF

M. DE. MIRABAUD.


At a time when we are on the eve of an important change in our
political affairs, which must evidently lead either to the recovery and
re-establishment of our liberties, or to a military despotism, those who
are connected with the press ought to use every exertion to enlighten
their fellow-citizens, and to assert their right of canvassing, in the
most free and unrestrained manner, every subject connected with the
happiness of man.

The priesthood have ever been convenient tools in the hands of
tyrants, to keep the bulk of the people in a degraded servility. By the
superstitious and slavish doctrines which they infuse into their minds,
they prevent them from thinking for themselves and asserting their own
independence. At a moment when national schools are erecting in every
quarter of the country, not with a sincere desire of enlightening the
rising generation, but with the insidious design of instilling into
their minds the doctrines of "Church and King," in order to bolster up
a little longer the present rotten, tottering, and corrupt system: at
a moment, too, when thousands of fanatic preachers are traversing the
country, with a view to subjugate the human mind to the baleful empire
of visonary enthusiasm and sectarian bigotry to the utter extinction
of every noble, manly, liberal, and pilanthropic principle;--at such a
moment as this, we thought that the "SYSTEM OF NATURE" could not fail
to render essential service to the cause both of civil and religious
liberty. No work, ancient or modern, has surpassed it, in the eloquence
and sublimity of its language, or in the facility with which it treats
the most abtruse and difficult subjects. It is, without exception, the
boldest effort the human mind has yet produced, in the investigation
of morals and theology--in the destruction of priestcraft and
superstition--and in developing the sources of all those passions and
prejudices which have proved so fatal to the tranquillity of the world.

The republic of letters has never produced an author whose pen was so
well calculated to emancipate mankind from all those trammels with which
the nurse, the schoolmaster and the priest have successively locked
up their noblest faculties, before they were capable of reasoning and
judging for themselves. The frightful apprehensions of the gloomy
bigot, and all the appalling terrors of superstition, are here utterly
annihilated, to the complete satisfaction of every unbiassed and
impartial person.--These we considered as necessary observations to
make, previous to any attempt at the biography of the author.

Biography may be reckoned among the most interesting of literary
productions. Its intrinsic value is such, that, though capable of
extraordinary embellishment from the hand of genius, yet no inferiority
of execution can so degrade it, as to deprive it of utility. Whatever
relates even to man in general, considered only as an aggregate of
active and intelligent beings, has a strong claim upon our notice; but
that which relates to our author, as distinguished from the rest of his
species, moving in a more exalted sphere, and towering above them by
the resplendent excellencies of his mind, seems to me to be peculiarly
calculated for our contemplation, and ought to form the highest pleasure
of our lives. There is a principle of curiosity implanted in us, which
leads us, in an especial manner, to investigate our fellow creatures;
the eager inquisitiveness with which the mechanic seeks to know the
history of his fellow-workmen and the ardour with which the philosopher,
the poet, or the historian hunts for details that may familiarize
him with, a Descartes or a Newton, with a Milton, a Hume, or a
Gibbon--spring from the same source. Their object, however, may
perhaps vary; for, in the former, it may be for the sake of detraction,
invidious cavil, or malice; in the latter, it is a sweet homage paid by
the human heart to the memory of departed genius.

It has been repeatedly observed that the life of a scholar affords few
materials for biography. This is only negatively true;--could every
scholar have a Boswell, the remark would vanish; or were every scholar
a Rousseau, a Gibbon, or a Cumberland it would be equally nugatory.
What can present higher objects of contemplation--what can claim
more forcibly our attention--where can we seek for subjects of a more
precious nature, than in the elucidation of the operations of mind,
the acquisition of knowledge, the gradual expansion of genius; its
application, its felicities, its sorrows, its wreaths of fame, its cold,
undeserved neglect? Such scenes, painted by, the artist himself, are a
rich bequest to mankind: even when traced by the hand of friendship
or the pencil of admiration, they possess a permanent interest in our
hearts. I cannot conceive a life more worthy of public notice, more
important, more interesting to human nature, than the life of a literary
man, were it executed according to the ideas I have formed of it: did
it exhibit a faithful delineation of the progress of intellect, from the
cradle upwards; did it portray, in accurate colors, the production of
what we call genius: by what accident it was first awakened; what were
its first tendencies; how directed to a particular object; by what means
it was nourished and unfolded; the gradual progress of its operation
in the production of a work; its hopes and fears; its delights; its
miseries; its inspirations; and all the thousand fleeting joys that so
often invest its path but for a moment, and then fade like the dews
of the morning. Let it contain too a transcript of the many nameless
transports that float round the heart, that dance in the gay circle
before the ardent gazing eye, when the first conception of some future
effort strikes the mind; how it pictures undefined delights of fame and
popular applause; how it anticipates the bright moments of invention,
and dwells with prophetic ecstasy on the felicitous execution of
particular parts, that already start into existence by the magic touch
of a heated imagination. Let it depict the tender feelings of solitude,
the breathings of midnight silence, the scenes of mimic life, of imaged
trial, that often occupy the musing mind; let it be such a work, so
drawn, so coloured, and who shall pronounce it inferior? Who rather
will not confess that it presents a picture of human nature, where every
heart may find some corresponding harmony? When, therefore, it is said,
that the life of a scholar is barren, it is so only because it has never
been properly delineated; because those parts only have been selected
which are common, and fail to distinguish him from the common man;
because we have never penetrated into his closet, or into his heart;
because we have drawn him only as an outward figure, and left unnoticed
that internal structure that would delight, astonish, and improve. And
then, when we compare the life of such a man with the more active one
of a soldier, a statesman, or a lawyer, we pronounce it insipid,
uninteresting. True;--the man of study has not fought for hire--he has
not slaughtered at the command of a master: he would disdain to do
so. Though unaccompanied with the glaring actions of public men, which
confound and dazzle by their publicity, but shrink from the estimation
of moral truth, it would present a far nobler picture; yes, and a more
instructive one:--the calm disciple of reason meditates in silence; he
walks his road with innoxious humility; he is poor, but his mind is his
treasure; he cultivates his reason, and she lifts him to the pinnacle of
truth; he learns to tear away the veil of self-love, folly, pride, and
prejudice, and bares the human heart to his inspection; he corrects and
amends; he repairs the breaches made by passion; the proud man passes
him by, and looks upon him with scorn; but he feels his own worth, that
ennobling consciousness which swells in every vein, and inspires him
with true pride--with manly independence: to such a man I could sooner
bow in reverence, than to the haughtiest, most successful candidate for
the world's ambition. But of such men, for the reason I have already
mentioned, our information is scanty. While of others, who have
commanded a greater share of public notoriety, venal or mistaken
admiration has given more than we wished to know. Among these respected
individuals of human nature, may be placed Mirabaud. Had Mirabaud been
an Englishman, who doubts but that we should have possessed at least
ample details of the usual subjects of biographical notice; while all
that has been collected among his own countrymen, is a scanty memoir in
a common dictionary. That we are doomed to remain ignorant of the life
of such men, speaks a loud disgrace.--I lament it.

JOHN BAPTISTE MIRABAUD, was born at Paris in the year 1674. He
prosecuted his infantile studies under the direction of his parents, and
was afterwards entered a member of the _Congregation of the Priests of
the Oratory_, where he passed several years, and produced some very bold
writings, which were never intended for publication.

He was subsequently appointed tutor to the princesses of the House of
Orleans, and then took the resolution of destroying the greater part of
the manuscripts that he produced while a member of the _Congregation_;
but the treachery of some of his friends, to whom he had confided his
manuscripts, rendered this precaution useless, for some of his works
were published during the time he remained the preceptor to his royal
pupils; among which number may be reckoned his "New Liberties of
Thought," a work but little calculated for gaining him friends in the
purlieus of the Court of Orleans. The "Origin and Antiquity of the
World," in three parts, was also published at this period, and from the
publication of this work, may be dated the resolution of M. de Mirabaud
to quit his office of preceptor, which he relinquished, having become
more independent; he now gave himself up entirely to his philosophical
studies, and produced the "System of Nature," with which he was assisted
by Diderot, D'Alembert, Baron D'Olbac, and others.

The profound metaphysical knowledge displayed throughout the System
of Nature, and the doctrines which are therein advanced, warrants the
conclusion, that it is at once the most decisive, boldest, and most
extraordinary work, that the human understanding ever had the courage to
produce. The study of metaphysics his generally been considered the most
terrific to the indolent mind; but the clear and perspicuous reasoning
of a Mirabaud, who has united the most profound argument, with the most
fascinating eloquence, charm and instruct us at the same time. But it
was not, to be expected that such doctrines as are contained in the
System of Nature, would be advanced without meeting with some opposition
from the superficial and bigoted metaphysicians, who feel an interest
in upholding a system of delusion and superstition. No! certainly not,
Their interest was threatened, and their _craft_ in danger, and the
consequence was, that the _Atheist_ or _Disciple of Nature_, has
been abused with every scurrilous epithet, "full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

Atheism is stigmatized with having "opened a wide door for libertinism,
destroying the social and moral compact; and striking a deadly blow
at religion. It is asserted that the atheist, who by his opinions has
deprived himself of the hope and consolation of a future life, has no
motive for the practise of virtue, or to contribute to the well being of
society. Deprived of a chimera which religion every where presents him,
he wanders through the cheerless gloom of scepticism, regardless of the
consequences of an abandoned life. Without a God, he acknowledges no
benefactor; without divine laws, he knows no rule for the conduct of
life, and submits to no law but his passions. An enemy to all social
order, he spurns at human laws, and breaks through every barrier opposed
to his wickedness." Under such colours is an atheist painted: a short
digression must be suffered to examine this picture, and to disprove the
assertions so sweepingly made.

I admit that atheism strikes a deadly blow at religion; because under
the cloak of religion, mankind have been oppressed in all ages; but that
it encourages libertinism, or destroys the "social and moral compact," I
have yet to learn. In all organized governments, men are restrained from
crime and compelled to submission by laws supposed to be made for the
general benefit. These laws are the effect of the first formation of
society for mutual preservation. Here then is a sufficient motive
for the one as well as the other, to contribute to the well-being of
society. The laws of Nature are the same in effect on the atheist
and the religionist. If man be led captive by his passions, and gives
himself to debauchery and voluptuousness, nature will punish him with
bodily infirmities and a debilitated mind. If he be intemperate, she
will shorten his days and bring him to the grave with the most poignant
remorse. The fatal effects of his vicious propensities will fall upon
his own head. A disturber of social order will live in continual fear
of the vengeance of society, and that very fear is a more dreadful
punishment than the just vengeance which perhaps he escapes. It renders
life burdensome, and makes a man hateful to himself. Can men have
stronger motives for the practise of virtue? The atheist is in full
possession of these motives, and the religionist is most completely
swayed by them, whatever may be his pretensions to others derived
from religion. But we are assured he has other motives; more powerful
incentives, in the promise of future rewards and punishments. This, like
all other chimerical doctrines, cannot be maintained if we look at the
general practise of mankind. Let us trace the effects of this doctrine,
or rather let us examine the actions, conduct, and character of men
professing it, and we shall see how little influence it has over them.
The bulk of society believe they shall answer in a future life for the
deeds done in the present. Nay, I hardly think one in a hundred thousand
will say they doubt it. What then is its effect? With this dreadful
sentence, _"Thou shalt go into everlasting punishment,"_ continually
sounded in their ears, do we not daily see the greatest enormities
committed? Are not the most horrid crimes perpetrated in all parts
of the world? The most vicious propensities and the most extravagant
follies are almost indiscriminately gratified. Is not vice frequently
triumphant, and virtue compelled to seek her own reward in retirement?
The laws of society are broken by the most flagrant injustice, and the
laws of nature outraged by the most shocking depravity. All this evil
exists in nations believing themselves to be accountable beings after
death. Where then are the beneficial effects arising, to mankind from
the promulgation of this doctrine? Men who cannot be restrained from
doing evil by human laws, have no dread of any other. Their whole lives
and conduct confirm this. Others who live in submission to the laws of
society, give themselves up to those vicious habits, (without fear of
divine laws) which the law does not take cognizance of. Men, not wholly
depraved, or not without the pale of society, generally respect the
laws, and fear the bad opinion of others. Hence we observe, when
interest or passion leads them into secret vices, they invariably play
the hypocrite; and although they are aware of the denunciations of their
God, whom they acknowledge is a witness to all their actions, while they
preserve their fair fame they still persevere. In fact, they live as if
they disbelieved in his existence; and yet the greatest criminal, the
most depraved wretch, would shudder at being told there is no God. The
atheist, as a man, is liable to commit the same crimes, and fall into
the same vices as the believer; but because he is an atheist, is he a
worse criminal than the other? In one respect, I conceive he is not so
bad. He only acts in defiance of _human_ laws,--he only offends men; the
other infringes _both divine_ and _human_;--he defies both God and man.
Both are injurious to society and themselves, and both are actuated by
the came motives.

Again we are told, that the well disposed part of mankind are rendered
more virtuous, and the vicious less vicious by this doctrine. How are
we to know that? If the virtuous man acts uprightly, does good to his
fellow creatures, restrains his passions, and returns good for evil,
experience teaches him it is his interest so to do. Those who are
viciously disposed are only deterred from crime by penal laws. Societies
cannot long exist, where evil has the ascendency. Without social
laws, this would really be the case, notwithstanding the threats of an
avenging God. If men were told they would not be answerable for the evil
committed in this life to human laws, but that God would punish them
after death, it is evident the human race would soon be exterminated.
On the other hand, tell them their crimes will never be punished by God,
or, in other words, there is no other God than NATURE, but that the laws
of men will avenge the offences against society; so long as those
laws are administered with justice and impartiality, so long will such
society continue to improve. Hence it is evident that the system which
will maintain order in society by itself, must be the best and most
rational. A good government without religion would be more solid and
lasting, and tend more to the preservation of mankind, than all the
theocratical or ecclesiastical governments that ever the world was
subject to.--Thus much for the opponents of atheism.

It has been asserted with a perverse obstinacy, by the advocates for the
existence of a deity, that the SYSTEM OF NATURE was never written by
the author whose name it bears.--It is granted that it was not published
during his life: but that circumstance forms no reason why such a
conclusion should be drawn. The persecutions which the atheists have
endured, were a sufficient excuse for the work not appearing in any form
during the life time of its venerable author. The Athenians sought to
try Diagoras the Melian, for atheism; but he fled from Athens, and a
price was offered for his head. Protagoras was banished from Athens, and
his books burnt, because he ventured to assert, that he knew nothing of
the gods. Stephen Dolet was burnt at Paris for atheism. Giordano Bruno
was burnt by the Inquisitors in Italy. Lucilio Vanini was burnt at
Thoulouse, through the kind offices of an Attorney-General. Bayle
was under the necessity of fleeing to Holland. Casimio Liszynski was
executed at Grodno;--and Akenhead at Edinborough. And the body of the
eloquent and erudite Hume, was obliged to be watched many nights by his
friends, lest it should be taken up by the fanatics, who considered him
one of the greatest monsters of iniquity, because he did not happen to
believe as they believed.--With these pictures of Christian persecution
before his eyes, is it surprising that M. de Mirabaud should adopt the
resolution of suffering the SYSTEM OF NATURE to appear as a posthumous
work? That the same fate would have attended him, the most devout
Christian will not undertake to deny.

However the sentiments of M. de Mirabaud may be condemned by the
fanatics, all those who knew him bear the most brilliant testimony of
his integrity, candour, and the soundness of his understanding; in a
word, to his social virtues, and the innocence of his manners. He died
universally regretted, at Paris, the twenty-fourth of June, 1760, in the
eighty-sixth year of his age.

The following works, written by him at different periods, were never
published:--_The Life of Jesus Christ. Impartial Reflections on the
Gospel. The Morality of Nature. An Abridged History of the Priesthood;
Ancient and Modern. The Opinions of the Ancients concerning the Jews._ A
wretched mutilated edition of this last work was published at Amsterdam,
in 1740, in two small volumes, under the title of _Miscellaneous
Dissertations_.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

        by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
018:014 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here];
        and he will kill me.
018:015 Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
        I will surely show myself to him today.
018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went
        to meet Elijah.
018:017 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,
        Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
018:018 He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your
        father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments
        of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel,
        and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets
        of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
018:020 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered
        the prophets together to Mount Carmel.
018:021 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you
        waver between the two sides?  If Yahweh is God, follow him;
        but if Baal, then follow him."  The people answered him
        not a word.
018:022 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet
        of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men.

"Nothing there evidently," Colonel Welsh eventually broke the silence.
"Perhaps it was just a falling star, but I never saw a star fall _up_."

"Maybe it was some of that Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said with a
chuckle. "I never heard of it being seen in this part of the country,
though."

"Saint _what_?" Freddy Farmer echoed. "What in the world are you
talking about? And what is it?"

"Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said. "Didn't you ever hear of it, Freddy?"

"Would I be asking, if I had?" the English youth snapped. "Go on. Stop
waiting to be encouraged to show all your knowledge. Just what is Saint
Elmo's Fire?"

"Well, I can't give you a scientific answer to that one," Dave said.
"But Saint Elmo's Fire is the name given to globular electric light
often seen on the spars and rigging of ships at sea during a storm.
And of recent years it has been seen on the wing tips of airplanes
flying through electrically charged air. Frankly, I've never seen any
of the stuff in my life. But I knew a pilot once who used to fly over
the Andes in South America, and he said they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed to roll right along the leading
edges of the wing, and then disappear just when you thought they were
going to bump into the gas tanks, or something. The first few times he
witnessed such a display he lost a dozen years off his life. He said,
though, that after a while he got used to it--even looked forward to
it every time he took off."

"You're pulling my leg!" Freddy snorted.

"No, Farmer, that's true," Colonel Welsh said. "I've seen some Saint
Elmo's Fire myself. And I can tell you that it scares the pants off you
the first time you see it. Ever fly through a thunder storm, and see
lightning playing around your wing tips?"

"Yes, I've seen that," Freddy admitted. "And I was sure I'd never live
to land safely on the ground again."

"Well, then, you know how it feels to see Saint Elmo's Fire," the
Colonel chuckled. "Only I think the Saint Elmo stuff gives you a worse
scare when you see it actually come rolling along the wing toward you.
But that light I saw just now wasn't shaped like a ball. More like a
streak, or like the powdered tail of a comet. It was strung out in a--"

If Colonel Welsh finished the sentence, nobody heard it. At that moment
the night skies shook and trembled with the savage yammer of aerial
machine gun fire. And the cabin window not eighteen inches in front of
Dave's eyes seemed to crack in a trillion places and then melt away
into oblivion.

"My word!" Colonel Welsh cried. "What was that?"

Dave didn't bother to answer for a second or so. His heart had zoomed
up his throat to jam hard against his back teeth, and his eyes had
bulged out of their sockets like marbles on sticks. Instinct took split
second charge of his movements, however, and almost before he realized
what he was doing he had booted the Lockheed up over on left wing tip
and was slicing down through the air. At practically the same instant
he whipped out his free hand and switched off the navigation lights.
Then as the craft went slicing down through the night sky, he dragged
air into his aching lungs.

"Those were aerial machine guns!" he cried. "And whoever was working
them was in earnest. Look at that window! Just a shade improvement on
his aim and it would have been curtains for the three of us."

As the last left Dave's lips, he pulled the plane out of its wild
sideslip and went curving up and around to the left.

"Aerial machine guns?" Colonel Welsh echoed in blank amazement. "You're
crazy, Dawson!"

"Could be, and maybe!" Dave snapped. "But I've heard those sky
choppers often enough to recognize them every time. And do you think an
eagle or something flew into that window, sir?"

"No, of course not," the Intelligence chief grunted. "Sorry I sounded
off. You're right, of course. But it doesn't make sense. Who the devil
would want to take a crack at us?"

Dave shrugged in the darkness, and for a moment or so as the plane
roared heavenward he strained his eyes for a glimpse of some other
shadow cutting about in the air. He saw nothing, however, and then
turned his head and spoke back over his shoulder.

"Maybe not _us_, sir," he said, "but I guess the Axis would be pretty
tickled to see _you_ put out of circulation. If you want my guess, some
rat saw you take off with us. Maybe he used a hidden radio and sent
word ahead. This mountainous country is a swell place to hide a plane,
you know, sir."

"And those _were_ exhaust plumes you saw!" Freddy Farmer cried. "The
lad was probably climbing up to get around in back when you saw his
exhaust plumes. Well, let the beggar come again. We'll--Good grief!
This plane isn't armed!"

"No," Colonel Welsh said in a slightly hollow voice. "Guess they never
figured it was necessary to arm these utility planes used to transport
personnel about the country."

"If only the chaps in high places would stop _figuring_ so much in this
war!" Dave groaned.

"Quite!" Freddy Farmer echoed the truth bitterly. "But bemoaning the
lack of common sense in the average High Command won't help us now. If
the blighter comes back for another fling, Dave, you'll just have to--"

"Don't bother telling me!" Dave shouted. "Here he comes--from the left
and up! Hang onto your seats!"

The last had hardly left Dave's lips before he was hauling the Lockheed
straight up on its tail. Before the plane reached stalling speed,
however, he kicked it over on wing and then sent it dropping nose first
toward the black carpet below that was the ground. No sooner had he
kicked the plane over on wing than he switched off both engines, and
shoved the compensator throttle open wide, so that no carbon sparks or
exhaust light of any kind would etch their path downward through the
night.

Meanwhile the mysterious attacker had opened fire again, but Dave's
quick action at the controls caused the unknown killer to miss by a
wide margin. The flickering ribbon of tracers didn't even come close.
And at the end of another three or four seconds the Lockheed was well
on its way earthward and out of sight.

"See that bird as he banged on by us?" Dave cried, when he was able to
talk again. "It looked to me like a small Beechcraft. Or maybe it was a
Waco. But he's carrying two guns--and he wants us mighty badly. Heck,
if there were only guns aboard this crate. I had a beautiful broadside
bead on him."

"Yes, I saw his silhouette as he tore by," Freddy said through clenched
teeth. "But I didn't recognize his type. I don't know the Yank planes
very well, though. But I say, Dave! Watch our altitude, you know!"

"You're telling me!" Dave grunted. "I'm watching it plenty, and
praying, too. There must be some of those mountains under us by now.
I think we've got a couple of thousand feet to play around in, but no
more than that. I'm flat gliding her as much as I can, but keep those
eagle X-ray eyes of yours on the job, Freddy. And yell if you see a
mountain peak looming up."

"Mountain peak!" Colonel Welsh cried excitedly. "For pity's sake, keep
above them, Dawson. Start those engines and get us some altitude!"

"That would be risking more than this glide, sir," Dave told him.
"That bird up there has been spotting us by our exhaust plumes, and
aiming blindly. So long as we show no light at all he stands to lose us
completely. But if we open up the engines and show exhaust light he's
going to be able to take another crack. And--well, third time never
fails, you know, and stuff. Our best bet is to try and lose him before
we get too low. He has a ship that can travel, but if we get a little
lead on him we'll be all right."

"But remember all those mountain peaks down there!" the Intelligence
chief persisted. "One thing this plane has got is parachutes. Perhaps
we'd better bail out and let the blasted ship crash. At least we'd save
our own necks."

"Not me!" Dave barked without thinking. "Go ahead and bail out if
you want to. You, too, Freddy. But I'm sticking with this ship if
I possibly can. I don't want to see her bust up, if I can help it.
Anyway, I'm going to give her all the breaks she's got coming."

"And of course I'm staying with you," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "I'm
a blasted fool to put my precious neck in your hands. But there you
are, anyway."

"No wonder you two are famous for pulling miracles out of a hat!"
Colonel Welsh growled. Then after a short pause: "Very well! If Farmer
trusts you that much, I suppose I might as well. But if you have to hit
a mountain, for pity's sake try and pick out a soft one. I bruise very
easily!"




CHAPTER SEVEN

_Pilot's Luck_


Dave chuckled as the Colonel's remark came to his ears, but his heart
pounded a little harder and the warm glow of pride rippled through his
veins.

"Thanks, sir," he said. "And sorry that I exploded that way. But don't
worry, I'll get us out of this little jam if it's the last thing I do."

"Well, see that it _isn't_, my good man!" Freddy Farmer grunted.

For the next few moments nobody said a word. All three of them leaned
forward in their seats and strained their eyes at the darkness ahead
and below. Dave's hands felt cold and clammy, and he could feel the
little drops of sweat ooze out on his forehead and trickle down his
face. For the last fifteen seconds or so he had spotted what he
believed to be a mountain peak just ahead, and not more than a hundred
feet below. He didn't say a word to the others. He kept his mouth shut
and eased the plane a little to the left so as to be able to pass on
by the peak with enough free air to spare between his right wing tip
and the unseen trees or jagged rocks he knew must dot all sides of
that peak. Once past it, he could start the engines again and climb
for altitude. It was a cinch that the unknown attacker was cutting
about in the black sky somewhere far behind him. But once he got beyond
that peak he felt that his lead would be great enough for him to risk
showing his exhaust plumes. As a matter of fact, though, it was quite
possible that the unknown attacker was miles and miles behind. It was
possible that the man had cut around to the east, believing that Dave
wouldn't dare chance holding his westerly course with the mountains so
close.

"Yeah, maybe!" he murmured. "But I'm going to make sure just the same!"

"What did you say, Dave?" Freddy Farmer cried out in a voice of alarm.

"I didn't say a thing," Dave grunted, and tightened his hold on the
controls. "Just thinking a little out loud. Shut up, little man, or
you'll make me rock the boat."

Freddy Farmer caught his breath as though he were about to speak.
Instead, though, he said nothing. He simply leaned farther forward
in his seat. Dave caught the movement out the corner of his eye,
and grinned, tight-lipped. Freddy had sighted the mountain peak, but
realized that he had seen it and was trying to slide by on the left. So
the English youth had snapped his lips shut so as not to give Colonel
Welsh a slight case of heart failure. Good old Freddy. Always knew when
to open his mouth, and when to keep mum.

Perhaps it was six seconds, but it seemed like six thousand years to
Dave before the slightly darker shadow that was the mountain peak slid
past the tip of the right wing and disappeared behind. The instant it
was gone from view he whipped on the switches, caught both engines,
and fed them high test gas at full throttle. The roar of the engines
breaking into life was a sound akin to worlds crashing into each other.
Yet at the same time it was a welcome sound to Dave's ears, and to
Freddy Farmer's too. But what filled their hearts with an even greater
happiness was the Lockheed climbing upward to a safe altitude above the
mountain range. The instant he was well clear, Dave swung the plane
onto its westerly course again, and relaxed in the seat.

"Top-hole, Dave," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "A very pukka bit of
flying, that."

"Thanks," Dave replied. "We got away with it okay. But I'd hate like
heck to have to do it every day. You spotted that mountain peak, didn't
you?"

"Quite," the English youth murmured. "But I thought it best to keep my
mouth shut. Realized that you knew what you were doing. And besides, no
sense in--"

"No sense in giving this old dodo grey hairs, eh?" Colonel Welsh spoke
up with a chuckle. "Well, it was nice of both of you, but I saw it,
too. The only reason _I_ didn't speak, though, was because my tongue
was frozen stiff. As you say, Dawson, I'd hate to have that sort of
thing for a daily diet. Very sweet flying, though, very sweet."

"We could have made it sweeter if this plane had been armed," Dave
grunted, and stared at the black sky ahead. "That tramp certainly had
his nerve jumping on us. Wonder who the heck he could be. Sure you
haven't any ideas, Colonel?"

There was a long minute of silence while the senior officer seemed to
make up his mind.

"No, I'm afraid I haven't," he finally said slowly. "As you mentioned
awhile back, there are probably plenty of birds who would like to see
me out of the way. Somehow, though, I can't see them going about it in
this manner. Their style is more along the line of pot shots from dark
doorways. Or a bomb in my car, or tossed through my window. Frankly, I
can't make head nor tail of this business tonight."

"Many chaps know you were headed west, sir?" Freddy Farmer asked
quietly.

"What do you mean, many?" the Colonel replied sharply. "Did I broadcast
it, you mean?"

"Hardly that, sir," Freddy chuckled. "I mean, did you tell many people
that you were making this trip? Not that any of them are in the pay
of Tokio or Berlin, sir, but it's possible that one of them might
innocently enough mention the fact to somebody who was. You understand
what I mean, sir?"

There was another moment of silence while the chief of U. S.
Intelligence thought things over.

"I see what you mean, Farmer," he grunted presently. "No, I didn't tell
anybody who didn't have the right to know. Fact is, the only ones I
told were those three officers you met in my office. And if those three
aren't one hundred per cent Americans, then I'm Adolf Hitler in the
flesh."

"What about the other end?" Dawson asked.

"What other end?"

"San Diego," Dave said. "Is your man in charge there expecting you? Or
are you just dropping in on a surprise visit?"

"No wonder you chaps always come out on top," Colonel Welsh said in a
frank tone. "Once you get your teeth in something you keep at it until
there's nothing left. Yes, I did wire my head agent in San Diego that I
was coming west tonight. And--"

"And my first month's pay as a U. S. Naval Aviation Lieutenant says
somebody read that wire!" Dawson cut in quickly.

"Hold it!" Colonel Welsh cried, and laughed shortly. "You're flying one
wing low this time. I said in the wire that I was coming out, but I
didn't say _how_, or _what_ time I'd arrive. Afraid you're off on the
wrong scent there, Dawson."

"Maybe, maybe not," Dave said doggedly. "But that chap didn't have a
crack at us tonight just for gunnery practice. He was shooting for
keeps. He knew darn well who was in this plane--and he was out to get
us. He--"

Dave didn't finish. At that moment the right outboard engine of the
Lockheed lost revs fast and began to sputter and clatter. Dave snapped
his eyes at the dash dials, and sucked in his breath sharply as he saw
the oil pressure needle sliding around the face of the dial toward
the zero peg. However, even as he glanced at the needle, it stopped
swinging back and promptly climbed upward again. The engine stopped
sputtering and clattering, and once again sang its full throated song
of power.

The tiny lump of ice remained in Dave's chest, however. He glanced
sidewise at Freddy Farmer and saw the corners of the English youth's
mouth tighten a bit.

"What the devil was that?" Colonel Welsh demanded in a sharp tone.
"Something wrong with the engine?"

"Not now," Dave said with an easiness he didn't feel. "Guess it picked
up a bit of ice but got rid of it in time. Anyway, she's back where
she should be. As I was saying, that lad tonight was out for blood. So
it must follow that somebody knew where you were going, when, and how.
Don't you think so, sir?"

Dave spoke the words, but it was really just an effort to keep the
conversation going. The lump of ice in his chest was hurting him
again, and he was feeling far from calm and collected. The way the
oil pressure of the right outboard engine had dropped told him that
there was trouble ahead. Many people claim that the carburetor is the
heart of an engine, and probably it is, if you want to look at it that
way. However, countless hours in the air had proved to Dave that your
real danger signal is when oil pressure starts dancing around. Engines
can run, often for a long, long time, when the carburetor is out of
whack and the engine is getting a bad feed. But let oil pressure go
screwy and you'll have real trouble on your hands. There are no halfway
measures about oil. It has to be right or your engine is worth no more
than its weight in junk. Gasoline is food for an engine, but oil is its
life blood. If it hasn't got the proper amount it dies, but definitely!

And so Dave spoke the words just to keep the conversation going and
fixed his eyes on the instruments pertaining to the functioning of the
right outboard engine. He hoped and prayed that the skipping had simply
been just one of those things. But in his heart there was gnawing
fear and dread. He feared that bullets from the guns of that unknown
attacker had nicked one of the oil feed lines, and that continued
vibration of the engine was slowly but surely shaking the feed line
connection loose, or at least causing it to crack and buckle slowly, so
that eventually the pressure set up in the line would be reduced to nil.

If it had been daylight, or if he had been sure of the terrain below,
he would have landed and made sure what had happened. But a landing was
too great a risk right now. His best bet was to keep going, nursing the
right outboard engine as much as he could, and hoping and praying that
it would continue to tick over and produce power.

"Yes, I guess your reasoning is sound enough," he heard the Colonel
say. "It's rather hard to believe, though. I mean, why go about it in
such a--well, in such a story book thriller style, you might say? I'm
not going to San Diego on any vital mission. Fact is, I could make this
trip tonight or next week, and it wouldn't make much difference. That's
what makes it seem so--so utterly crazy."

There was a moment of silence, and then Dave laughed a trifle
flat-toned.

"I don't mean to be conceited," he said. "But what you've just said,
sir, doesn't make me feel so good. Or maybe it should make me feel
important as heck. How about you, Freddy? Catch on?"

"I think so," the English youth replied. "But it's a bit--er,
fantastic, you know. However, I would feel a bit better if we had been
able to shoot the beggar down. Always did say night attacks weren't
quite the sporting thing, you know."

"Not the sporting thing, huh?" Dave echoed with a snort. "Pal, that's
only putting it by half. In my book they're plain murder."

"Of course, I'm only the passenger," Colonel Welsh spoke up sharply.
"So don't mind me. However, I would like very much to know what the
devil you two are jabbering about. What's it all about, anyway?"

"You tell him, Freddy," Dave said. "I--I feel too modest."

"Rubbish!" the English youth snapped. "You couldn't be if you tried.
Besides, you brought it up."

"Listen, you lads!" the chief of U. S. Intelligence boomed in
exasperation. "Have I got to use my authority as a Colonel? What in
blue blazes are you two talking about?"

"The fantastic, sir," Dave said with a chuckle. "Yet, on the other
hand, possibly the truth. Maybe the pilot of that plane didn't want
_Farmer and me to go aboard the Carrier Indian_."

Colonel Welsh made a hissing sound as he sucked in his breath sharply.

"Great guns!" he gasped. And then in the same breath: "But that _is_
impossible. Not even my three closest assistants knew that was to
happen until I informed you. And we went from my office straight to
Alexandria Field. No, you must be wrong, Dawson. Captains Lamb and
Stacey, and Lieutenant Caldwell, wouldn't breath a word of that even
though a gun were held at their hearts. That _is_ fantastic!"

The two boys looked crestfallen.

"See, Freddy?" Dave cried, and jabbed an elbow in his pal's ribs. "You
get the screwiest ideas. I never--!"

"None of that, funny boy!" the English youth barked back at him. "No,
you don't, not by a jugful. You brought it up. I simply agreed with
you, to be polite. You're quite right, Colonel. It's ridiculous. But
when you get to know Dawson better, you'll understand how he's--"

The rest of what Freddy Farmer would have said to the Colonel stuck
fast when only halfway up his throat. The right outboard engine
had started kicking up again, but this time it was really doing it
in earnest. The oil pressure needle went around to the zero peg in
a single jump. And even as Dave grabbed for the throttle, the right
outboard engine let out a grinding scream as though it were actually
something human, and in mortal pain. It had run dry and was seizing
up. Almost at the same instant, and as though in sympathy for its
mechanical brother, the left outboard engine started falling off in
revs at an alarming rate. Dave killed the right engine completely,
shoved hard on the left rudder to check the plane yawing, and
concentrated on keeping the left outboard engines alive as long as
possible.

"That tears it!" he said between clenched teeth. "I was afraid that
right engine had been nicked. Getting ready to drop a couple of those
landing flares, Freddy. At least we can take a look at what it's like
below."

"Take a look?" Colonel Welsh cried sharply. "You don't have to, boy!
There are mountains down there. Get us as high as you can, and then
we'll all bail out."

A hot wave of anger swept through Dawson, but he was able to choke the
words back in time. Instead he turned to Freddy Farmer and nodded.

"Let a couple go, Freddy," he said quietly. "We're only losing a foot
or two of altitude. We'll take a look _first_!"




CHAPTER EIGHT

_Nobody's Airport_


Freddy Farmer didn't bother acknowledging the request by word of mouth.
He simply nodded, and reached out his hand and jerked the little handle
that released landing flares fitted into the wing tips. There were a
few seconds more of silence; then a great silver-white light came into
being below, and spread swiftly outward toward the four points of the
compass.

Fighting the tendency of the Lockheed to yaw toward the dead engine
side, and struggling to keep the left outboard engine turning over,
Dave leaned over close to the shattered window and peered down into the
sea of silver-white light below. For a couple of seconds he couldn't
see anything but eye-dazzling light. Then as the flares dropped astern,
he was able to get a good look at the type of terrain below.

What he saw didn't exactly cause his chilled heart to warm up and loop
over with joy. True, they had safely crossed over the highest peaks of
that part of the mountain range. Below, though, were the tree-covered
foothills, cut by deep jagged stone sided ravines, and narrow plateau
formations of ground that would be hard for even a crow to alight on.

"It's no go, Dawson!" Colonel Welsh's voice suddenly broke the tingling
silence that had settled over the trio. "I know what's in your mind,
but our safest bet is for all three of us to jump. We've still got
three or four thousand feet of clearance. I think we should jump."

"I don't, not yet," Dave said bluntly, and raked the terrain below with
his eyes. "I think we should hang on a bit longer, and try to pick out
some spot big enough to slip into. This is wild country here, Colonel.
If we bail out we'll lose contact with each other, and all three of us
get lost. Let's look hard, first. I can keep her up a big longer. That
left outboard hasn't quit cold yet. And we're not losing altitude too
fast."

"All right," Colonel Welsh said grimly, and leaned forward the better
to study the flare-lighted ground below. "Confound that rat! I'd give a
lot to have his neck between my two hands right now!"

"I can think of things to do to him, myself," Dave grunted. Then, out
of the corner of his mouth: "Work those eagle eyes hard, Freddy. This
is where you should star. You always do see things first. Hurry up and
find Papa a place big enough to set us down in."

"Shut up and tend to your flying!" the English youth growled. "You
dropped our nose two feet while you were talking. Want to power dive
us in, or something? You--hold it, Dave! Bear right a bit. What's that
down there? It looks like--oh, blast it! They would, wouldn't they!"

The last was caused by the two flares finally touching ground and being
snuffed out. Quick as a flash Freddy Farmer shot out his hand and
released two more flares. The instant his eyes were again accustomed
to the bright light, Dave looked in the direction of the English
youth's pointed finger. His heart did loop with joy this time, and
he gulped with relief. What at first looked like the rock studded
side of a foothill was actually a strip of barren and seemingly level
ground between two foothills. It wasn't very big, but it seemed big
enough--unless Lady Luck deliberately turned her face the other way.

"Yeah, check, Freddy!" Dave murmured, and eased the laboring Lockheed
around and down. "That's us, that spot. Just hang on, everybody. It
won't be long now!"

"I don't like the way you say that!" Colonel Welsh said with a
mirthless laugh. "But I guess you don't mean it. Go ahead, though. I
was wrong again. We'll keep the parachutes in their packs. What a fine
night this has turned out to be!"

"Me, I'm thinking of tomorrow and next week," Dave muttered grimly as
he eased the Lockheed lower and lower, and around toward the near end
of the narrow landing space. "This is wild country here. It's plenty
wild. Right in the middle of nowhere. And this baby isn't going to do
any more flying until she has a couple of new engines stuck in her. Oh
well--"

Dave let the rest go with a shrug and hunched forward slightly over the
controls. The time for talking had passed. Now was the time for action,
and prayer. The Lockheed was down low now, too low to correct any
mistakes. The first swipe at that narrow landing space had to be good.
It had to be perfect. The jagged rocks and trees on all four sides
would make a second try impossible.

Dave's whole body felt dry as a chip, yet at the same time sweat poured
off his forehead, and the palms of his hands were clammy and cold. He
could almost feel Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh hold their breath.
As far as that went, he could almost feel the whole world stand still
and hold its breath. The dropped flares were throwing off less and less
light, but he refrained from telling Freddy to drop a couple of new
ones. Their first moment of brilliance might blind him just enough to
misjudge things by a hair. And misjudging by a hair would be more than
enough to pile them up in a heap among the trees and jagged rocks.

"Now!" he whispered softly. "Now, baby! Easy does it, now. Down you go.
Down you go. Ah-h-h...! That's the stuff!"

The Lockheed's wheels touched, touched hard, and the plane tried to
push itself off and up into the air again. But Dave had killed the
forward speed as much as he could. And after a short run forward,
and gentle but firm application of the wheel brakes by Dawson, the
twin-engined craft finally bumped to a halt not ten feet from the lip
of a sharp drop-off in the ground.

"Now I've seen everything!" Colonel Welsh fairly exploded the words.
"I've seen two miracles come to pass in the same night. It couldn't
be done, but you did it, Dawson. Congratulations from the bottom of my
heart. Good work! We really are on the ground, aren't we?"

Dave didn't bother to answer. As a matter of fact he couldn't have
said a single word at that moment even though it would have gained him
a million dollars. His heart was stuck halfway between his chest and
his throat, and refused to go up or down. It was the same with Freddy
Farmer, too. The English youth sat stiff and straight in his seat,
working his lips but making no sound. Eventually, though, he did manage
to get control of his tongue and of his frozen muscles. He reached
across and pressed Dave's arm.

"Top-hole, Dave!" he got out in a husky voice. "A bit of the very, very
best, and I mean it, really. As a pilot bloke myself, I know how good
you have to be to get away with that sort of thing. It was absolutely
perfect."

"What else?" Dave cracked back with a shaky laugh. "Look who did it!
But skip it. Is my hair grey, Freddy? Do I look very much older? I know
doggone well I gained forty years in those last couple of seconds.
Jeepers! Take a look at that drop-off ahead. Another ten feet and you
_wouldn't_ be thinking I was so hot. And I'm not, really. If Lady Luck
ever landed a plane, she did it that time, and I'm not kidding."

"Well, we're down, anyway," said Freddy. Then, getting practical: "What
do we do now? Do you know this area very well, sir? Have we got far to
go to the next village?"

Both Dave and the Colonel laughed in spite of the seriousness of the
situation. And Freddy made angry sounds in his throat.

"What's so blasted funny about that?" he demanded. "Do you plan to stay
here all night?"

"Sorry, Freddy," Dave said, and patted his pal's knee. "But this isn't
England, where you can throw a rock from one town and have it land in
the next one. This is our wild and woolly west. I don't know exactly
where we are, but I'd make a rough guess that we're a good two hundred
miles from the nearest town. And that's as the crow flies. Going over
and down these mountains and hills, you could add another two hundred
miles. What do you think, Colonel?"

"Well, not quite that far, Dawson," the senior officer said with a
laugh that was just a little too tight. "You're stretching it a little,
I'd say. Call it a hundred by air and two-fifty by foot, I guess.
We're just over the Arizona line and south of Holbrook. I'm afraid,
though, Farmer, that we will have to sit here for the rest of the
night, worse luck. To try and get out of here in the dark is just about
like deciding to step off some cliff and smash yourself to bits on the
bottom of a ravine. No. We've got to sit here until they find us."

"Hey!" Dave cried. "Aren't you forgetting something, Colonel? I mean,
who knows we're on our way? We--Oh, I see! You planned to send word
back to your office, eh? When they don't hear, they'll send planes
hunting for us, huh?"

The Colonel groaned heavily and clapped a hand to his forehead.

"You spoiled it that time, Dawson!" he muttered. "But you hit the
nail on the head. I did forget. I mean, I didn't say anything about
letting Lamb or Stacey know when I arrived at San Diego. They simply
expect to hear from me, when they hear. And my man at San Diego doesn't
actually know when I expect to arrive. This _is_ a sweet mess. I should
be demoted and kicked back into the ranks for not thinking of this
possibility. We're stuck, and no two ways about it."

"But we took this plane from the Alexandria Field," Dave said. "What
about their flight board there? Don't they list every take-off, the
pilot, and where he's heading?"

"Usually, but not in a case like this," the Colonel replied unhappily.
"When I borrow a plane, I don't tell them where I'm going. And
naturally, they don't ask me. But do we have to sit here in this
darkness, Dawson? The lights don't run off the engine, do they? How
about some light, eh?"

"Sure, sir," Dave said, and flipped up a couple of switches.

The interior of the compartment glowed with light, and the three looked
at each other. They grinned in a friendly sort of way, but neither of
them was particularly happy looking. Freddy Farmer twisted around in
his seat and looked at the Colonel.

"Then we might be here for some time, sir?" he asked.

"For several hours, at least, Farmer," the senior officer replied
gravely. "Nothing to worry about, though. As soon as it's light, we'll
build a fire and get a smoke signal in the air. A passing transport
plane may see it and come down to investigate. We're a bit south of
their regular run, though. Still, one of them may see it and get some
rescue parties sent out. Nothing to worry about."

"Not even your constant worry, pal," Dave laughed, and stuck a hand in
his tunic pocket. "Your constant worry about starving, I mean. Here's a
flock of chocolate bars I picked up at Alexandria Field before we left.
One thing I didn't tell you about Farmer, Colonel. If he can't eat
forty times a day he gets as weak as a kitten. And where he puts it,
I'll never know. Doesn't weigh more than a hundred and fifty soaking
wet. He's--"

"Some other time, my funny little man!" Freddy cut in harshly. "I
wasn't thinking about eating, if you must know the truth. Something
more serious. Or at least it will be serious if we're stuck here for a
considerable length of time."

Dave's smile faded immediately. He stared at the English youth. Colonel
Welsh also regarded him keenly.

"Okay, what?" Dave finally asked.

"The Carrier Indian," Freddy replied. Then, looking at the Colonel,
he asked, "Didn't you say that she weighs anchor sometime tomorrow
afternoon--this afternoon, really? If we're stuck here, will she sail
without us? Or has her skipper orders to wait for word from you?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence swallowed hard and made a wry face.

"That close-shave landing!" he muttered savagely. "It still has my
brains all scrambled up. You're quite right, Farmer. What you say makes
it more of a mess than ever. The Indian is to sail whether her skipper
hears from me or not. Those two men of mine serving as machinists'
mates are already aboard. At least they were to go aboard last evening.
But she won't wait for you two. The skipper has his sailing orders, and
he'll sail whether he's shy two pilot lieutenants or not. Blast and
double blast it all! What you say, Farmer, gives me a very disquieting
thought. Perhaps I _wasn't_ the one that unknown killer was interested
in. It's quite possible that it _was_ you two. The attempt was made
to stop you from reaching the Indian before she sailed. Confound it!
If I've fumbled this thing all up, I'll go out somewhere and cut my
throat. But--but I still can't see how anybody else could possibly have
found out about this flight, let alone the real reason!"

Dave didn't say anything, but he was thinking of a case he had heard
about in England not so long ago. A bad leak had been found in the Air
Ministry Intelligence, and when it was eventually tracked to its source
it was discovered that a high official's own secretary--a supposedly
loyal Englishman who had held his post since long before the outbreak
of war--was actually in the pay of the Nazis.

"I'm wondering something, myself," he said presently. "Not to toss more
cold water on things, Colonel, but--well, you don't know for sure if
your two men went aboard the Indian last evening, do you?"

"No, not for sure," the senior officer replied with a shake of his
head. "But it's--Oh, I see what you mean. Maybe they were--er--delayed,
too, eh? You think of the nicest things, Dawson! But keep on thinking.
Don't stop. Maybe you'll think of a way to get us out of this jam in a
hurry."

"I sure wish I could!" Dave said fervently. Then, reaching out and
taking a flashlight from the instrument panel clamps, he said,
"Meantime I'm going to have a look at the engines. I could be wrong
about an oil line being nicked. It wouldn't be the first time. Maybe
it's something that we can patch up with some gum and a piece of our
shirts, and we can get ourselves out of here come daylight. That's a
hope, anyway."

Half an hour later, though, it wasn't a hope. The oil feed lines of the
right outboard engine were split and parted in three different spots.
Besides that, she was seized up tighter than a drum, and couldn't be
made to move short of using dynamite. The left outboard engine wasn't
in a much better condition. Bullets from the unknown attacker's guns
had started a bad leak in the gas line that couldn't be repaired
without the proper tools. And so at the end of the half hour Dave wiped
oil and grease from his hands and climbed down off the wing onto the
ground where Freddy Farmer and the chief of Intelligence waited.

"No soap," he said bitterly. "If that bird's job was to delay us, he
did it up brown. The only way you'll get this plane out of here is to
fly in a couple of new engines. Nothing to do but wait for daylight."

"Why wait?" Freddy Farmer protested. "Let's get a fire going now. No
telling but what it might be seen by somebody. It--I say, though! What
about your Indians? They'd give us a bit of trouble, wouldn't they?
I've heard--"

"Hold everything, pal!" Dave chuckled, while Colonel Welsh struggled
to keep a straight face. "Nowadays you only find that kind of Indians
in books, or in the movies. Let's get the fire started. It's a good
idea. And if Indians do show up I'll welcome them as the flowers in
May."

Freddy Farmer hesitated and looked hard at Dawson. After a moment or so
he shrugged.

"Very well, then," he murmured. "But I swear I don't know when to
believe you, and when not to. If I get scalped--"

"You won't!" Dave stopped him, and backed away. "Head's too hard!"

Freddy took a quick half step forward, but gave it up. Then the three
of them started collecting deadwood, and stuff from the plane that
could be used to make a good fire.




CHAPTER NINE

_Rescue Wings_


Dawn came roaring up over the mountains to the east to touch off
their peaks with fire, and send rainbows of color arcing off in all
directions. It was a sight to make a man catch his breath and stand in
awe of the glorious majesty of nature. But for Dave Dawson and Freddy
Farmer and Colonel Welsh, the coming of the new day was more than just
something beautiful to watch and admire. It was like being released
from a prison of darkness.

As soon as there was enough light to allow vision at any great
distance, they eagerly and hopefully scrutinized their immediate
surroundings. But what they saw dashed their hopes even lower.
Heart-chilling wilderness met their gaze on all sides. It was as though
they had landed at the very end of the world; landed in a little pocket
of level ground completely lost in the depths of jagged rock sided
hills and towering snow-capped mountains.

For several minutes they looked about them in silence. Then, as though
at an unspoken signal, they turned and looked at each other, each man
reading the message of utter helplessness reflected in the next man's
eyes. It was Dave who finally broke the silence, and spoke the thought
that was in the minds of the other two.

"Our smoke signal won't be seen by any plane unless it passes directly
over this spot," he said. "These hills and mountains are such that
it's as if we were at the bottom of a well. And it's going to be even
tougher getting out of here on foot."

Neither Freddy Farmer or Colonel Welsh said anything. There wasn't
anything they could say. Dave had spoken the truth. And that was that.
Eventually Colonel Welsh knocked the ashes from his dead pipe and stuck
it back in his pocket.

"We'd better not try going out on foot for a while," he said, "at least
not until tomorrow. Better to stick here today and see if anything
happens. I'm mighty sorry this happened, you fellows. It's all my
fault, and I could kick myself right up the side of that mountain."

"I wouldn't say that, sir," Freddy Farmer said with a smile. "You had
no idea that chap was going to attack us last night."

"No," the chief of U. S. Intelligence growled. "Just the same,
ignorance is no excuse. I should have made sure, just in case the
unexpected did happen. I certainly should have taken a plane fitted
with a radio, instead of this one that hasn't got any. At least we
could have let the world know that we were going down for a forced
landing. But as it turned out--"

The Colonel sighed heavily and let the rest slide. Dave and Freddy
looked at each other and shrugged. It was no use crying over spilled
milk, but as a matter of cold hard fact both of them had been just
a little surprised when they had boarded the plane and seen that it
carried no radio. Neither, though, had said anything about it.

"Why wasn't it fitted with a radio, sir?" Dave finally blurted out the
question. "I mean--well, a radio is standard equipment on any ship. Is
there no radio on this for some particular reason?"

"Yes," the senior officer replied with a wry smile, and tapped his
chest. "I'm the reason. On a couple of occasions when the plane I
was in did have a radio, I was contacted about this and that every
half hour or so. Once I even turned back because of a message I had
received, only to find I'd wasted my time. Ever since then I've flown
without a radio. Been able to get more done, too. But I certainly
struck out this time. I'm sorry."

"Well, those things happen," Dave said politely, and let the subject
drop. "How about a short scouting trip about here? Or better yet, what
say I to make the top of that mountain, there? I guess I could do it in
a couple of hours. Maybe we're not buried as deep as we think we are.
Maybe I'll see a town, or a Ranger camp from there. Also, I may find
some berries and stuff, and a spring. The chocolate we have aboard, and
the drinking water, isn't going to last us for very long. What do you
think, Colonel? Think you can keep Freddy cheered up while I'm gone?
See that the Indians don't get him?"

The Colonel grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but what he was
about to say never left his lips. At that moment all three of them
heard the faint drone of a plane somewhere up in the sky, but out of
sight behind the towering mountains north of them. As one man they spun
around and stared hard at the dawn light bouncing off the snow-capped
peaks. Nobody said a word. Nobody could. They were all too busy
holding their breath, and praying as they had never prayed before.

After a few seconds Dave snapped out of his trance, ran over to the
pile of deadwood they had collected, grabbed up an armful, ran back to
the fire and dumped his load. Then he picked up a can of oil drained
from the engine and poured it on the licking flames. A second more and
a column of oily black smoke went towering up into the dawn sky.

"He can't miss that, unless he's blind!" Dave muttered through clenched
teeth as the black smoke mounted higher and higher. "Come on, whoever
you are, take a look, take a look!"

"Steady, Dawson," Colonel Welsh cautioned gently as Dave's voice rose
to a wild shout. "We've got to steel ourselves in case he doesn't see
it. Then it won't be so tough. This thing might happen several times,
you know. No telling. Save your strength, son. Take it easy."

Dave hardly heard the words of wisdom. His eyes were glued to the
north, his ears strained to catch every beat of the plane's engine
which was still out of sight, and his two fists clenched tight as
though he were actually pulling the unseen plane closer and closer.
Then, suddenly, the drone of the engine grew louder. It rose to a
mighty roar. And then the plane came sailing into view above the
mountain peaks. It was a five-place Stinson cabin plane, a commercial
plane probably owned by some rancher. There were no markings on the
craft other than the usual Bureau of Aeronautics license letter and
number. A wild cry of joyous relief struggled up Dave's throat but was
unable to pass his lips. A riot of emotions boiled up within him, and
his lips and his tongue were suddenly too dry to form sounds. So he
simply stood stock still and grinned from ear to ear as the cabin plane
cleared the peak and then came nosing down toward them; circling down
like some giant bird seeking a spot to light on.

When it was less than five hundred feet over their heads, the three men
shook themselves loose from their paralytic spell and started jumping
around and waving their arms wildly as though the pilot of the plane
hadn't seen them yet. The pilot waggled his wings as a signal that he
had, and then leveled off and went coasting toward the eastern end
of the landing strip. There he circled back, suddenly fed hop to his
engine and started to climb. For one horrible moment Dave was afraid
the pilot had decided that he couldn't put his plane down on the small
strip. But he was wrong. The pilot had simply goosed his engine to add
enough to his speed to clear the tops of some tall trees. He slipped
over them, went up on left wing a bit, and slid down to level off in a
perfect landing.

Even as the plane was braking to a stop, Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel
rushed back to it. They pulled up to a halt, waited for the plane to
roll the last few feet, then ducked under the left wing and around to
the cabin door. They had already seen that there were two men aboard
the plane, the pilot and a passenger. As Dave watched them come back
from the pilot's nook to the cabin door, he was faintly surprised by
their looks. Why, he didn't know, but somehow he had expected to see
a couple of youngsters climb down from the plane. But they weren't
young. They were both well along in years. They had hard, rugged faces,
covered by at least a two week's growth of whiskers. They wore rough
clothing, and each man carried a gun slung at his hip. The guns were
not pistols, though. They were automatics, and Dave suddenly had the
hunch that their rescuers were a couple of fire rangers, or at least
some kind of government men. The way they leaped cat-like out the cabin
door and down onto the ground seemed somehow to suggest the military
to Dave. But what they were didn't matter in the slightest. They had
arrived to rescue them, and that was all that counted.

"Stuck, huh?" the older one of the pair grunted, and grinned. "Lucky we
happened to see your smoke signal. You might have camped here for quite
a spell. Army and Navy, huh?"

"And in a hurry," Colonel Welsh said. Then, after introducing himself:
"We had a forced landing. Er--engine trouble. Can you fly us to the
nearest Air Corps Base where we can pick up another plane? I'll see
that you're paid for it, of course."

"Guess so," the man grunted after a look at his partner. "But where're
you headed? Maybe we could hop you all the way, and save time, if
you're in such a hurry."

"San Diego," Colonel Welsh said. "I have to get there as soon as
possible. But maybe you haven't the gas."

"San Diego, huh?" the older one, who was the pilot, murmured, and
arched his brows. "Yeah. I guess we can make it there from here. Had
engine trouble, huh? Not much fun in this neck of the woods. Okay. Get
aboard."

A hidden thought was tugging at Dave's brain, but he couldn't seem to
get it out in the open. Something was just a wee bit wrong with the
picture, but after a moment of deep thought he decided it was worry
about a take-off from the narrow space of level ground.

"Think you've got a long enough run?" he asked, and jerked a thumb at
the crippled Lockheed. "Maybe the five of us should haul that out of
the way. But even then you wouldn't have much extra. There's a sharp
drop-off just ahead of it."

"Don't get in a sweat, kid," the man mouthed, and gave him a hard
stare. "I wouldn't have come down if I'd thought I couldn't get off
again. Just get aboard and keep your seat. We'll get you places, and
with no trouble at all. Okay, Colonel, let's get going."

With a curt nod the pilot and his passenger turned and climbed back
into the plane. Colonel Welsh followed at their heels, but for an
instant Dave and Freddy hung back. They looked at each other and
frowned slightly.

"Queer couple of blokes, aren't they?" the English youth murmured.
"Can't say I like their looks much."

"I've seen better," Dave replied with a nod. "But so long as they
get us out of here, I don't care what they look like. But--is there
something on your mind?"

"Not a thing," Freddy replied. Then, with a puzzled scowl: "Just sort
of feel funny, though. One of your confounded hunches, I guess. Oh
well! No doubt it's your American climate. I'm sure I should have
stayed in England."

"Hop in, or do you two kids want to stay and play boy scout?"

The Stinson's passenger stood framed in the cabin doorway. His blue
green eyes stabbed down at Dave and Freddy, and the mop of coarse red
hair on his head actually did look like fire in the glow of the dawn
sun. Dave stared at him, felt that elusive thought tug at his brain for
the last time, and then climbed into the plane with Freddy right behind.

The pilot at the controls glanced back just long enough to see that
everybody was aboard, and then he goosed the engine and taxied around
on one wheel, and went trundling back toward the far end of the landing
strip. His friend, the redhead, sat in the co-pilot's seat, but he was
twisted around so that he faced Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel, who
were sitting in the three passenger seats. A grin parted his lips, but
he seemed to be grinning over their heads rather than at them.

For a brief instant a clammy chill rippled through Dave. He shook it
off, angrily told himself that he was letting his imagination run wild,
and concentrated on watching the pilot take the plane off. It was a
beautiful bit of flying, and Dave nodded his head in silent approval
and admiration as the pilot held the Stinson on the ground until he had
plenty of forward speed, then gently eased it off and up as nice as
could be.

Holding the nose up, the pilot circled the Stinson upwards until the
mountain peaks were almost on a level with the wings. Flattening off
the climb, he banked around for the last time and went roaring between
two mountain peaks to the north. For a couple of minutes Dave was too
thrilled by the wild, heart stopping beauty of the mountain scenery
below to pay much attention to the course of the plane. Eventually,
though, when the sun continued to stay on the right wing side, he
stopped gaping at the terrain below, and glanced sharply ahead. The
redhead was still grinning, very comfortably relaxed in his seat. And
the pilot was still holding the nose pointed north as though he planned
to keep going in that direction for quite some time to come.

Dave held his peace for a moment or so longer. Then curiosity and an
eerie tingling sensation at the back of his neck forced the words off
his lips.

"We're heading north!" he called out. "San Diego isn't north of us!"

Both Colonel Welsh and Freddy Farmer jumped as though they had been
shot. They turned and stared at him, wide-eyed. The redhead stared at
him, too. But his eyes were slightly narrowed, and his perpetual grin
stiffened slightly. He didn't say anything.

"Well, what is the idea, anyway?" Colonel Welsh finally boomed angrily.
"San Diego is west and south of here!"

The redhead shrugged and nodded, but the pilot didn't even turn his
head.

"That's right, isn't it?" he called out. "Well, what do you know about
that? I guess we ain't heading for San Diego, Colonel. Kind of looks
that way, don't it, huh?"

Colonel Welsh blinked and looked blank for a moment. Then his face
reddened and he started up out of his seat.

"See here!" he thundered. "What in--?"

The redhead made a quick motion, and the chief of U. S. Intelligence
choked off the rest. But it was the automatic that suddenly seemed to
jump right into the redhead's hand that really stopped him. He froze
motionless half up out of his seat. The redhead waved the gun a little.

"Relax, and sit, Colonel!" he said in a voice that sounded like small
stones on a tin roof. "I couldn't let you have it down there, but up
here it's easy. Relax and get smart. And that goes for you two kids,
too!"




CHAPTER TEN

_Vulture's Nest_


For a long minute there was no sound inside the cabin save the faint
drone of the plane's engine. Like three men suddenly struck dumb, Dave,
Freddy, and the Colonel stared at the redhead. Rather, they stared at
the automatic he held in his right hand; held so that at the bat of
an eyelash he could send a bullet into either of them, or into all
three of them, for that matter. Then, finally, Colonel Welsh broke the
silence.

"What in thunder _is_ this?" he demanded. "Who are you two? What's the
idea?"

The redhead hunched his shoulders and half nodded his head toward the
pilot.

"That's Ike, and I'm Mike," he said with a chuckle. "But it isn't any
act. We're just keeping you on ice for a while, Colonel. Be nice and
you'll get back into circulation again in time. Be dumb, and you'll be
dead."

As the Colonel struggled for words, Dave leaned forward a little, arms
resting on his knees.

"This isn't the plane you flew last night," he said.

The redhead grinned all the more and shook his head.

"Nope," he said. "And that makes you a bright little boy--Flight
Lieutenant Dawson. And that was nice flying last night. I thought that
second time I had you cold. I guess you're as good at the controls as
I've heard tell you were. Or was this English kid, Farmer, doing the
flying?"

Dave didn't reply. He suddenly felt as though his seat had been
jerked out from under him, and as if his brain were tumbling down
through space. This redhead knew his name, and Freddy's, too? An eerie
chill swept through him, and he impulsively looked at Colonel Welsh.
The chief of U. S. Intelligence's face was bright with dumfounded
amazement. He in turn was staring speechlessly at the redhead. The man
with the gun dragged down a corner of his mouth in a scornful gesture.

"Why so surprised, Colonel?" he asked. "Did you think you were the only
smart one in this war?"

"You won't feel so smart when you're facing a firing squad!" the
Colonel clipped out. "And that's where you're headed. Both of you!"

"Well, what do you know!" the pilot cried out, and turned around just
long enough to give the Colonel a horse laugh. "Maybe you ain't got it
yet, Colonel, who's holding the gun. Snap out of it. I know it's tough,
but there's nothing you can do about it. Don't be a sap and make us let
you have it. We just want to keep you on ice for a while. That's all."

The Colonel seemed to swallow his wrath, because when he spoke again
his voice was normal, and almost friendly.

"All right, we'll be smart," he said. "But where are we heading? And
why are you keeping us on ice, as you call it? What good is it going to
do you?"

"What good?" the redhead echoed with a laugh. "Well, about ten thousand
dollars' worth, for one thing. For another--well, I guess we just don't
like you."

A hard, glittering look leaped into the Colonel's eyes, and Dave could
tell that the man was employing every ounce of his will power to stop
from leaping from his seat and hurling himself at the redhead, gun or
no gun.

"A couple of bought and paid for American traitors, eh?" the chief of
U. S. Intelligence suddenly grated. "American by birth only. Actually
lower than the rats in Berlin and Tokio are--the ones who are paying
you your blood money. Well, paste this in your hats. You'll never live
to spend that money. And that's a promise!"

The redhead simply continued to grin. Then suddenly the gun in his hand
spat flame and sound, and Dave saw the Colonel's left shoulder strap
fly off as though cut by a knife. The bullet tore on out through the
side of the cabin. Colonel Welsh didn't so much as flinch, or even bat
an eye. He held the redhead with a steady agate-eyed stare.

"Put the next right between my eyes!" he grated. "You'll still not
be able to spend that blood money. You'll be run to earth like the
anti-American vermin you are. And you'll be wiped out, along with the
rest of your fifth column brood."

The redhead didn't say anything. Dave wasn't sure, but he thought he
saw a look of fear flash across the man's unshaven face. However, it
came and went in a flash. The pilot turned from his controls again, and
gave the Colonel a long look.

"Maybe!" he finally said harshly. "That's the chance we take. But let's
not kid each other, Colonel. The point is that the Carrier Indian won't
be sailing with these two little heroes of yours aboard. Yeah! So don't
look like you're going to faint. We know all about it. The boys we work
for are smart. And your whole country is going to find that out in
short order, too.

"You guys in Washington have got a New Deal. Well, another guy has a
_New Deal_, too. I like his better. So don't waste breath trying to
unsell me. It can't be done. I've been kicked around too much by your
cops and F.B.I.

"I'm looking out for my own good, see? I found out how my pal and me
can make dough easy, and we're making it. No more working my life away
for nothing. I'm sold on _my_ New Deal.

"Now shut up, and relax. My pal and me have dough to earn."

"Aw, let 'em talk!" the redhead said with a hoarse laugh. "Maybe
they'll try selling us some of them Defense Bonds."

"And you shut up, too!" the pilot snarled. "I don't feel like hearing
anybody talk, see?"

The redhead looked both surprised and angry.

"Okay, okay!" he said. "So nobody talks."

Silence once more settled over the interior of the cabin, but it was
the kind of a silence that feels charged with high voltage electricity,
and apt to strike all over the place at an instant's notice. Turning
his head, Dave snapped a quick glance out the window, but what he saw
didn't help his spirits any. The plane was grinding northward over wild
mountainous country that looked every bit as uninviting as that narrow
strip of ground where they had force landed. Whether or not they had
reached the Utah line, or were still in Arizona, Dave couldn't tell
with that one quick glance. And he didn't bother taking a second look.

Fact was, it didn't matter where they were. Through a crazy twist of
fate they were helpless prisoners in the hands of two men who would
shoot them dead at the slightest provocation. The single warning shot
that the redhead had snapped across Colonel Welsh's shoulder had been
proof enough that he wasn't afraid to use his gun.

Yes, they were helpless prisoners. And their captors knew all about
them: who they were, where they had been heading, and why. As those
three truths came home to Dave, again he swallowed hard and shivered
slightly. It was like a crazy nightmare, only it wasn't. It was stark
reality; nothing out of a story book. The pilot and his redheaded
companion had received orders to make sure that Freddy Farmer and he
did not sail on the Aircraft Carrier Indian. They had tried the first
time last night by attacking them with machine guns in a plane.

They had failed, yet in a way they had succeeded. They had drilled the
Lockheed's engines and forced Dave to sit down on that narrow strip
of smooth ground deep in a valley. Not knowing the exact results of
their efforts, the two men had cruised about over the area as soon as
it became light, and--by another crazy twist of fate--they had seen
the smoke signal that had been sent up to attract _help_. Seeing that
the plane had not crashed, the two men had done the logical thing,
from their point of view. They had landed and picked up their prey.
Kidnapped them, yes, but for a very good reason. Some other plane
passing over might have landed and given them a quick lift to their
destination. So the redhead and the pilot had picked them up to make
sure somebody else wouldn't do it.

And the reason they hadn't been killed on the spot was simple to
figure. Death in the dark during that air attack last night would
have been different. The plane would have crashed and burned up, and
when its charred ruins were found no one would ever had dreamed that
bullets had sent it hurtling down to its doom. But three dead men lying
beside a force landed plane was something else again. A scene like
that naturally screamed murder all over the place. And so the redhead
and his pilot had kidnapped them so that if another plane landed to
investigate, it would look as though the occupants of the Lockheed had
tried to find their way back to civilization on foot, and had become
hopelessly lost in the mountains.

"But they know all about us! How?"

Dave didn't speak the words aloud. He spoke them only in his brain,
but as he glanced at Colonel Welsh and met the man's eyes he knew that
the senior officer understood what was in his mind, just as though he
had heard the words spoken. Even as Dave met his eyes, Colonel Welsh
bit his lower lip and gave a sharp little puzzled shake of his head. A
hundred and one answers to the question leaped into Dave's brain, but
every one of them seemed too fantastic even to bother considering.

However, fantastic or not, one thought kept hammering away until he was
forced to admit that it at least must be true. It was that somebody
close to Colonel Welsh--very close--was unquestionably in the pay of
Berlin, or Tokio. Somebody in the drab, unpretentious building where
Colonel Welsh maintained his real head-quarters was a traitor to the
American flag, a paid rat of the lowest form who gnawed at the very
heart of America.

But who? Dave thought of Captain Lamb, and Captain Stacey, and
Lieutenant Caldwell--and shook his head vigorously. He thought of the
man who had taken them up in the elevator--and wondered. He thought
of the man reading the book in that room with the mops and pails--and
wondered some more. In fact, he wondered until his head ached and his
brain rang. It just didn't seem possible that any spy could get close
enough to learn all that somebody had learned. That, however, was one
of the many cockeyed things about war. The impossible was constantly
popping up to prove to be a cinch. There were over two years of proof
of that. Poland for one. The Maginot Line for another. And Crete, and
Malaya, and Singapore--and Pearl Harbor, too, for that matter. All that
had happened at those various places just couldn't happen. Only it
_had_!

"So maybe Lamb, or Stacey, or--"

Dave cut short the unspoken thought. The pilot up forward had throttled
his engine and was nosing the Stinson downward. Leaning over close
to the window, Dave peered down and ahead. He saw a stretch of wild
wasteland that seemed to extend to the four horizons. Scrub growth,
a few patches of towering trees, and all the rocks in the world, it
seemed, met his scrutiny. The plane seemed to be nosing down toward an
area of tableland. And as Dave squinted his eyes he suddenly was able
to make out a couple of weatherbeaten shacks built close to a patch of
woods. He thought he saw something glistening just under the branches
of the trees, but he was too high and too far away to tell what it was.

"Okay!" the redhead suddenly called out. "We're getting near the end
of the line. Remember what I told you, you three. Be nice and nothing
will happen. Get funny and I'll drill you and think nothing of it, so
help me. I ain't a killer often, but when I am, I'm good. So watch your
step."




CHAPTER ELEVEN

_A Little Bit Of England!_


Dave didn't bother looking at the redhead as the man pushed words off
the tip of his tongue. He kept his nose pressed against the cabin
window and watched with beating heart as the area of tableland came
sweeping up closer and closer to the plane. The nearer the plane got to
the ground, the more weatherbeaten and deserted the two shacks looked.
In fact, Dave knew that if he should be flying over them at even a
thousand feet or so, he would instantly take them for a couple of
prospectors' shacks abandoned to the wind and the rain years and years
before.

Another couple of minutes and the Stinson went up on wing, cut around
in a dime turn, and then leveled off and settled to earth between two
rows of sun-bleached rocks. Hardly had the plane braked to a halt than
the redhead was at the cabin door, pushing it open with one hand behind
him, and backing out. Every second of the time, though, he kept his
blue green eyes fastened on his prisoners.

"I'll take them inside while you put the job away," he said to the
pilot. "Stick her way under the trees with that Waco, just in case some
nosy guys come flying over. Nuts to take chances, you know. We'll--"

"Can it!" the pilot snarled. "Who are you, giving orders? Take them
inside. I'll be along in a minute, and help tie them up. But keep that
gun ready, and use it if you have to. We can't risk anything, see?"

"I see, sure I see!" the redhead snarled back. "What's eating you,
anyway?"

"Nothing, and shut up!" the pilot said in a brittle voice.

The redhead nodded, and motioned with his gun to Dave and the other two.

"Out!" he snapped. "And watch it. And keep your hands in sight, too."

Dave obeyed to the letter, but his heart was thumping against his ribs.
He had a sneaky feeling that Colonel Welsh's words had had a profound
effect on the pilot. Sure, he had snarled, and boasted, and cursed the
United States, the land of his birth. But like all rats of his ilk,
deep down in his black heart he was scared stiff of the Old Man With
the Whiskers. Deep down in his heart he knew that he might get by with
this back stabbing for a little while--just like the Japs--but not for
long. In the end he would be caught in the wheels of right and justice
and be ground to a pulp.

With the pilot feeling as he obviously did, snapping and snarling at
his own partner in this dirty work, perhaps something could be made of
it. Perhaps--

Dave didn't finish the rest. Without realizing it he had sort of
stopped to mull things over as he climbed down from the plane. He had
unconsciously started to push one hand into his tunic pocket. He didn't
even realize he was making the movement, but the redhead saw it, took
it for the wrong thing, and moved with the speed of light. The barrel
of the automatic was slapped against the left side of Dave's jaw just
hard enough for him to see stars and stumble. He ended up by falling
the rest of the way out of the cabin doorway and landing flat on his
face on hard dirt.

"And stay there!" he heard the redhead growl. "I'll take that gun just
as soon as your two pals are down. Okay, you two. Out, and keep your
hands where I can see them. Okay! Now, flat on your bellies and hands
outstretched. Either of you move, and you get it."

A moment later Dave felt the muzzle of the automatic pressed against
the back of his head, and felt the redhead's other hand going through
his pockets. He didn't move a muscle, and presently an angry curse told
him that the redhead realized he was wrong. Then the gun tapped him
lightly on the head.

"Stay put, with your hands out!" the redhead said. "I'll just make sure
about your pals."

Dave kept his throbbing face buried in the dirt until he heard the
redhead's voice again.

"Okay, on your feet, and inside! And no more kidding moves like that
last one, Dawson. My trigger finger's getting plenty itchy. Okay, move!"

Dave got slowly to his feet, blinked from his eyes water caused by
smacking the ground with his face, and walked stiff-legged in through
the door of the nearest shack. He expected to step into a room heavy
with age, and dust, and dirt, and all the countless smells of the
years. But he didn't. He stepped into a large sized room that was
comfortably furnished and fitted out like a hunting lodge. No, not
exactly a hunting lodge. Rather, it looked more like an arsenal.
There were guns all over the place, of all types: pistols, automatics,
rifles, and machine guns. Along the entire right wall were heavy wood
boxes that obviously contained thousands and thousands of rounds of
ammunition.

But what caught Dave's eyes and held them was the powerful gas engine
operated short-wave radio receiving set and transmitter that took up
most of the space at the rear of the room. One glance told him that
every part of it was of the finest equipment, and that its operator
could contact points thousands and thousands of miles away. One look at
the set and he guessed instantly that one of its chief uses was to send
weather data to listening Axis ears. This was probably one of several
such stations hidden in the vastness of the United States. In time they
would be smoked out and destroyed. Meantime, though, they were serving
the Axis powers well, and, unquestionably, in a dozen different ways.

"Not bad, huh?" he heard the redhead's voice with its taunting note.
"We have lots of fun here, Mike and Ike. See what I mean, Colonel? We
got it all doped out. You Army and Navy guys are suckers. You don't
stand a chance, what I mean. When the time's right, we'll move in.
And that's all there'll be to it, see? Steady, Colonel! Steady, pal.
Rushing me will just get you a bullet in that belly of yours. Take it
easy, and relax. Back up, and sit down on that case. You two kids, too."

As the redhead grinned and made motions with the gun, Dave, Freddy,
and the Colonel slowly backed up until they were sitting on a couple
of gun cases. Once they were settled, with their hands carefully kept
in sight, the redhead hooked one leg over a nearby table and absently
stroked the palm of his other hand with the barrel of his automatic.
Dave heard Colonel Welsh's tight, rasping breathing beside him, but he
didn't look at the man. Nor did he glance at Freddy Farmer, who hadn't
spoken a word since they had entered the Stinson. Instead, Dave kept
his eyes fixed on the redhead--and waited, and hoped, and prayed.

"Yeah, we have us some fun here," the redhead went on, and looked
straight at Colonel Welsh. "But soon we're going to have some real fun.
See all these guns, Colonel? Lots of people are going to hear them pop
off, soon. People east in Washington, too. The boys running this show
have it all doped out. It'll be a cinch."

"Do you know what you are?" the Colonel suddenly asked with an effort.

"No, you tell me, Colonel," the redhead said with a chuckle. Then,
before Colonel Welsh could get a word in edgewise: "You know, I'd
never tab you for head of the Intelligence, Colonel. You don't look
the part to me at all. But maybe that's what's made you the great man
of mystery, eh? Well, the mystery is over as far as I'm concerned. And
to tell you the truth, I'm kind of disappointed. When we got the radio
flash that you were aboard a plane heading west with these two kids,
I got kind of all excited. I got kind of sorry, too, that I'd have to
shoot you down without having a look at you. But--well, I did get that
look after all. And I'm disappointed."

"And you are a complete and utter fool!" Colonel Welsh said,
tight-lipped. "I told you once, and I tell you again! You'll never get
away with this. You'll be caught and either strung up, or shot. You'll
get--"

"Didn't I tell you to shut up? Well, do it. We can't be bothered
listening to your junk. Shut up! _Do you hear me!_"

It was the voice of the pilot, who had suddenly appeared in the
doorway. He stood glaring at Colonel Welsh out of eyes that held a
wild, glassy glitter. Two white spots appeared on either cheek, and as
the last left his lips they came together to form a thin cruel line.
Then before Colonel Welsh, or Dave, or Freddy Farmer could so much as
move a muscle, the man leaped forward and slammed his upholstered gun
against the Colonel's left temple. The chief of U. S. Intelligence
slumped over, but caught himself and straightened up slowly. A trickle
of blood ran down from the cut on his temple, but he made no effort to
raise his hand to it. He looked at the pilot and smiled grimly. Dave
marveled silently at the man's courage and ability to take it. The blow
he had received was enough to knock over a horse.

"Swing again, you rat traitor!" the Colonel got out evenly. "You know
in your heart that you're sunk. And it's making you lose your grip."

For an instant Dave thought the pilot was going to go stark raving
mad with rage and hurl himself at the Colonel. But he didn't. With a
visibly tremendous effort he regained control of himself and forced a
harsh laugh off his lips.

"That's what you think!" he snapped. Then out of the corner of his
mouth to his partner: "Get that rope, and we'll tie them up. We'll gag
this big slob. I'm sick of hearing his yapping."

Less than five minutes later Dave and Freddy were bound hand and foot.
Colonel Welsh was bound hand and foot, too, but he was also gagged. The
pilot made sure that the ropes were tied right, then turned his back
on them and walked over to a table on the other side of the room. He
picked up a whiskey bottle there, took a long drink and choked on it.
He coughed so hard he almost dropped the bottle. He would have if the
redhead hadn't jumped quickly forward and grabbed it.

"Hey, what's the matter with you?" the redhead demanded angrily. "You
getting the jim-jams? This is no time to fall apart. Snap out of it.
Get hold of yourself. Boy! Wouldn't the big boss like to see you, now.
I knew he should have put me in charge of this station."

The pilot suddenly went white about the corners of his mouth, and there
was cold murder in the eyes he fixed on the redhead. He reached out and
tapped the redhead on the chest with the barrel of his automatic.

"Just say that again, lug," he grated. "Go on! Just say it again!"

The redhead seemed to wilt like a flower tossed into a blast furnace.
He gulped and swallowed hard, and backed away a couple of steps.

"Okay, okay!" he got out hastily. "I was only kidding. But I only
thought--"

"Nobody wants you to think!" the pilot snarled, and took a step
forward. "Get it? Cut out the thinking. Now, get on that key and
contact Frisco. Tell them we've got them on ice, and what do we do now?
Tell them this place is cooked, if either of these three should get
away. Find out where he wants them delivered, or what. He was nuts to
have us go hunting them, and bring them back here. They'd have been
stuck there a week, anyway. And that's more time than we need to fly
these guns and stuff to the other places. But skip that last. Don't
tell them that, understand. The big boy wouldn't like it."

"I'll say he wouldn't!" the redhead said with a tight laugh, and went
through the motions of slitting his throat from ear to ear. "Okay. I'll
find out what we do now. Fun, I hope."

The redhead flung the trio of prisoners a leering look, then went to
the back of the room and sat down at the radio equipment. A moment or
so later the crackling of the spark gap of a wireless set filled the
room. Dave closed his eyes and strained his ears. He caught the signal
being sent out. It was S-T. It was repeated a dozen times or more.
Then the man stopped sending, and there was silence as he listened to
whatever was coming through his earphones. After twenty seconds or so
he started sending again. Dave caught all the signals, but that's all
the good it did him. He glanced at Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh, and
knew that they were catching the signals, too, and that the code going
out over the air was just as meaningless to them as it was to him.

For five minutes the redhead "talked" with the man at the other end of
the wave length. Then he switched off his set, got up and turned around
with a grin on his face that stretched from ear to ear.

"He thinks we're great guys," he said to his partner. "He thinks we're
the nuts."

"Horses to what he thinks!" the pilot growled, and ran a nervous tongue
tip along his lower lip. "What do we do now? What are his orders?"

"To sit tight," the redhead said. Then, after flashing Colonel Welsh a
smirking look, he went on, "He's coming up here sometime tonight. He
didn't say, but I've got a hunch he wants to work on our three friends
here. But he's tickled silly about it all. What a break for us we were
bum shots last night. This little job puts us in good, I'm telling you.
Boy! You can't top the big boss, can you? He knows his onions right
down the line. Yeah! Old blabber mouth, there, is going to have plenty
of chance to work his yap. And I mean, but plenty! Maybe he won't want
to, but I've seen the big boss's way of getting guys to talk. He's got
a technique, he has!"

"Coming up tonight, huh?" the pilot echoed with a happy smile. "Swell!
That means you and me will be shifted to some other station. And
that'll suit me okay. This neck of the woods is giving me the creeps.
Thirty days here. It's been like thirty years. Let's have a drink on
getting out of here soon."

"Yeah!" the redhead said, and licked his lips. "Let's have a couple of
them. I'm dry as a bone."

With that moment began an hour and a half that was just about the
toughest ninety minutes Dave Dawson had ever spent in his life. The
two unshaven men went over to the table and dropped into chairs and
proceeded to ignore their prisoners. That didn't bother Dave in the
slightest, though. He was quite content to have the two ignore him,
for he was too busy with his thoughts--thoughts that tumbled and
spilled around in his brain like little red hot stones. A hundred times
at least he strained at the ropes that held his wrists bound behind
his back. And a hundred times circles of white pain about his wrists
convinced him that he didn't stand a chance in the world of freeing his
hands, to say nothing of his ankles. A hundred times he cursed himself
bitterly for not getting away from that attacker last night--and
without damage to the Lockheed's engines. A hundred times he thought of
the Aircraft Carrier Indian and the unknown doom that hovered over her;
the unknown doom that was aboard her in the form of some rat Axis spy
who had killed and obtained vital information that could easily spell
disaster for many of Uncle Sam's fighting men of the sea if it reached
Japanese hands soon enough.

A hundred times he thought of many things, and each time his utter
helplessness to do anything about them was like a hot knife twisting
in his heart. But the most torturing thing of all was the realization
that he and Freddy had been stopped cold before they had even been able
to get started. The Carrier Indian was over three hundred miles away,
riding at anchor in San Diego harbor. Who knew when they would see it?
Who knew if they would _ever_ see it? Caught cold before they had even
got started on the very first of the special assignments they were to
carry out for Uncle Sam. What a sweet beginning! Yes! What a sweet
beginning that could well be the end, too. And that end might come when
the man referred to as the big boss arrived.

Thoughts, thoughts, and more thoughts that walked, raced, cut and
slashed their way through Dave's brain. Seconds dragged on into
minutes, and the minutes seemed to drag on into an eternity of time.
Then suddenly sound forced its way through Dave's thoughts and brought
him back to the present. The sound was soft moaning and groaning. And
it came from Freddy Farmer's lips.

The English youth was sitting on a gun case just beyond where Colonel
Welsh sat, but out in front of him so that Dave could see his pal.
And the look on Freddy's face was one of great pain, and not a little
of terror, and fear. His eyes were half closed, and he seemed to be
staring at nothing at all as he rocked jerkily back and forth like some
African savage praying to his idol gods. For a brief instant Dave
could hardly believe his eyes or his ears. Then a wave of sympathy
mingled with just a little annoyance swept through him.

"Pull up your socks, Freddy!" he said in a low voice. "Show these rats
you can take it. Come on, Freddy. Chin up, pal!"

The English youth groaned louder and opened his eyes a little. The look
he flung Dave burned with scorn.

"Blast you and your chin-up rot!" he grated. "I've had enough of this.
Gangster stuff, this is, not war. I know now I should never have left
England. This is a madman's country. I tell you I've had enough of it!"

Freddy fairly screamed the last, and had Dave not been tied hand and
foot he would have leaped over and slapped his pal's jaw. Something had
happened to Freddy Farmer. Something had snapped inside of him. Dave
had seen his pal in a hundred tight corners, every bit as tight as this
one. He knew full well that Freddy was red-blooded courage from his
head to his feet. But something had happened, and the English youth was
ready to crack up like an hysterical old woman.

"Freddy, cut it out!" he snapped. "Buck up, old man. Show them. Come
on, Freddy. The old R.A.F. stuff. We're not licked yet, and we won't
be. You know that!"

The English youth didn't answer at once. He sat swaying and groaning,
and staring at Dave out of half closed eyes. Then suddenly he began to
laugh softly. The laugh grew and grew until it was almost a scream.
The pilot and the redhead had put down their whiskey glasses and were
staring at him in wide-eyed amazement.

"R.A.F., my hat!" Freddy suddenly shouted. "This isn't war. This is
gangster business, like I've seen in your American movies. Well, I've
had enough of it. I can't stand it, do you understand. _I can't stand
it!_ These ropes are killing me. I feel as if I were all on fire!"

Freddy stopped short, looked over at the unshaven pair and spoke again
before Dave had time to open his mouth.

"I say, a drink of water, please!" he gasped. "I must have a drink of
water. I'm dying, really. I can't stand the pain. A drink of water,
please!"

The pair stared for a moment longer; then the redhead burst out with
laughter.

"The tough English, huh?" he jeered aloud. "Look at the brave R.A.F.
pilot, I don't think! Well, what do you know? The English can't take
it. I always said they couldn't. Mama! Mama! Sonny boy wants a drink of
water. Here! Pour a slug of this whiskey down his throat and make a man
of him. Okay, I'll do it!"

The redhead laughed some more and splashed whiskey from the bottle into
his glass. He pushed up from the table and came swaggering over to
Freddy Farmer.

"Here you are, sonny boy," he said, and leaned over to put the glass to
the English youth's lips. "Be Papa's great big man. Have a drink. Go
on, take some!"

Freddy Farmer groaned just once more, then leaned forward as though he
were going to drink. But he didn't drink. He became an exploding ball
of chain lightning, instead. Almost before Dave Dawson's startled eyes
could register what was taking place, Freddy Farmer whipped his right
hand around from behind his back and plucked the redhead's automatic
from its holster. In what was practically the same motion, the English
youth stood up and clubbed the gun down on the redhead's ear. At the
same time Freddy brought up his left clenched fist and landed solidly
on the man's jaw. The man closed his eyes, and folded up like an old
army cot to the floor.

The English youth didn't so much as watch the redhead crumple. Instead
he brought the automatic down into line with the pilot sitting stunned
at the table on the other side of the room.

"Don't even wink an eye!" Freddy barked, and slowly sat down again. "I
can put a bullet in your rotten heart from here with my eyes closed.
Keep your hands just as they are on the table. Don't move them an inch,
you dirty blighter!"




CHAPTER TWELVE

_Westward To War_


As Freddy Farmer hurled the words at the pilot, he reached down with
his other hand and fumbled with the ropes tied about his ankles. In
less than a minute he had them free. Still keeping his eye on the
pilot, who now was practically green with terror, he went over and
around in back of the man. In less time than it takes to tell about it,
he had his gun. Then he jerked him from his chair and spun him around.

"Sorry, old thing," he said, tight-lipped. "But you shouldn't say
things like that about America. Next to England, it's the grandest
country on earth."

The pilot blinked stupidly. Then he closed his eyes for good. He did
so because Freddy Farmer slugged him on the jaw, putting every ounce
of his one hundred and fifty-five pounds behind the blow. The pilot
turned slowly around twice, then fell flat on his face alongside his
unconscious pal. And it was then Dave realized he was not dreaming, and
was able to find his tongue.

"Holy jumping jellyfish!" he gasped. "I--I thought you'd blown your
top, Freddy. But it was a gag, huh? Boy, oh boy! Me for you, pal, every
day in the week, and twice on Sundays. Gee, Freddy! I'm a no good bum
for thinking--"

"Quite!" the English youth said with a wide grin. "But I'll forgive you
this once. But speaking of gags. I'll free the Colonel, and then see
about you. Just cool your heels a bit, my little man."

Moving over to the Colonel, Freddy took the gag away and freed the
senior officer's hands and feet. It wasn't until he was completely free
that the Intelligence chief was able to speak.

"I'll never forget this, Farmer, never!" he exclaimed in a rush of
words. "One of the finest things I ever saw in my life. I can hardly
believe it even now. It--well, it was like magic. It must have been.
How in blue blazes did you manage to free your hands? Mine were tied so
tight they still feel broken in a dozen places."

As the Colonel spoke he rubbed his hands and wrists vigorously. Freddy
blushed to the roots of his hair, but there was a pleased grin on his
lips.

"They tied me pretty tight, too, sir," he said. "But a chap in England
once showed me a trick of holding your hands so that there's still a
little slack no matter how tight they're tied. It doesn't work with
most people. I mean you have to have thin hands, and be able to sort
of fold them up so's they're no thicker than your wrists. Then you can
slide the ropes off, if you work at it long enough. I--well, I was able
to do it. The moaning and the request for a drink was just to get one
of them close enough. I hope you don't think I meant the things I said,
sir."

"Don't worry," the Colonel said, and slapped Freddy on the shoulder.
"You can say anything you want, at any time, and it will always be
okay with me, after this. I mean it! You make me feel like an amateur,
Farmer. It was wonderful. But let's get these two tied up while they're
still listening to the birdies. What a sweet punch you've got, Farmer.
And at your weight, too! You'd keep Joe Louis busy any time. But let's
get at these two, and get going."

Freddy and the Colonel bent over the two prostrate forms and started
roping them up hand and foot. Dave watched for a moment, then made
sounds in his throat.

"Hey!" he shouted. "I'm here, you know!"

Freddy turned his head and looked at him. Bright lights danced in the
English youth's eyes.

"Why, so you are," he murmured, and gave the Colonel a quick wink.
"Just who are you? And when did you come in?"

"Cut the comedy!" Dawson howled. "Get these confounded ropes off me, or
I'll fan your breeches plenty next time I get my hands on you, young
fellow!"

Freddy shrugged, pursed his lips and cocked an eyebrow at the Colonel.

"Bit violent, isn't he?" he grunted. "Think we should let him loose, or
wait a bit until he cools down?"

"I don't know," the Colonel said with a chuckle. "You're the boss. Do
as you think best. Maybe, if he said 'pretty please,' or something."

"Quite," Freddy said, and turned to Dave. "Say 'pretty please,' and
I'll consider it," he grinned.

Dave looked daggers, and pressed his lips tightly together. Freddy
sighed, stood up and started brushing dust off his uniform.

"What do we do now, sir?" he asked, and deliberately turned his back
on Dawson. "Want me to fly you to San Diego, and have somebody come
back for these three? Or--"

"Okay, okay, you win, you sawed off made in England little runt!" Dave
roared. "Pretty please, confound you. Now untie me, for cat's sake."

Freddy walked over to him and leveled a reprimanding finger.

"Such a tone of voice!" he admonished sternly. "Say it nicely, just as
you were taught in school, now."

Dave turned forty different colors of the rainbow, but he finally
managed to swallow his wrath.

"Pretty please," he said. "I will remember this moment always. And I
mean _always_, you cluck!"

Freddy laughed, and in half a minute had Dave free. As he pulled the
last rope loose, he stepped quickly backward and set himself for the
expected rush. But Dave simply rubbed his hands and wrists and glared
at him.

"Relax!" he growled. "I'm going to save this one up, you betcha! And
when the right time comes, will you sing a song and dance a dance for
me! Kidding aside, though, Freddy, that was something. I really mean
it. Boy! Can you always come up with something new! But don't think
that means I'm going to forget, you little bum. My turn will come."

Freddy grinned at him impishly, and then both stopped their horse play
and turned serious eyes toward the Colonel.

"We can still make San Diego with time to spare, sir," Dave said with a
glance at his watch. "Are we going to take those two along with us?"

"We certainly are," the Colonel said, and pointed a finger at the
pilot. "That one is just ripe to be cracked wide open. He'll blab
everything he knows to save his own neck. I've met his type often. Hard
as nails on the surface, but completely yellow underneath."

"It's pretty hard to believe that a couple of Americans would stoop
this low," Dave said, tight-lipped. "But I suppose the Axis has a fifth
column working here in the States just as they had in every other
country they tackled."

"True enough," the Colonel replied with a nod. "And as the saying
goes, some men will sell their souls for gold. Those two are the type.
Country and flag don't mean a thing to them. Something twisted inside
of them. They weren't put together right in the first place. But this
is a big thing for my bureau, boys! And for the F.B.I., too. I have
a hunch I know who their big boss is--a man the F.B.I.'s been after
for weeks. There'll be a welcoming committee waiting for him tonight.
Have no fear of that. Before we get going, however, I want to have a
quick look around here. Give me a hand. Maybe we'll find something of
importance. We've got an hour or so, haven't we?"

"Easy," Dave replied. "Shall we hunt for something special?"

"Hunt for anything!" the Colonel said grimly. "And pray for a miracle
find."

Exactly one hour and six minutes later they had finished going over
the room with fine tooth comb thoroughness. The net result was a batch
of papers that the Colonel clutched in his hand. A couple of them had
lists of names and addresses. The others were covered with messages
that were all in code, and couldn't be broken down right at the moment.
The Colonel was pleased with the results, but there was just the
slightest gleam of disappointment in his eyes. Dave saw the gleam and
wondered.

"We didn't find the miracle, sir?" he asked. "What was it?"

The Colonel tapped the papers and shook his head.

"It could be in this stuff, but I doubt it," he said. "I mean a clue
that would help us with the Carrier Indian business. However, I don't
think--"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence suddenly stopped, and a cold hard
glint came into his eyes. He turned around and stared down at the two
trussed up men on the floor. Both had recovered consciousness and were
watching him out of eyes brimming with terror. The Colonel eyed them
for a moment, then stepped forward and deliberately picked up one of
the two automatics Freddy had placed on the table. Turning, he sighted
the gun and pulled the trigger. The gun roared sound and flame. A hole
appeared in the floor a half inch from the redhead's left ear, and the
man screamed like a stuck pig. Colonel Welsh leveled the gun again and
drilled a hole in the floor a half inch from the redhead's other ear.

"See?" he barked. "I know a little about trick shooting, myself. Okay.
How's this for a bull's-eye? Right between those two. Right on the end
of your nose!"

The man screamed and writhed about on the floor.

"Don't, don't!" he gasped. "Oh, please don't, Colonel! Don't let me
have it."

"Then what about your brother rat aboard the Carrier Indian?" Colonel
Welsh thundered. "Who is he? What name is he using? What's his rank?
Speak up, you! I've got an itchy trigger finger, too!"

The redhead gasped, and gurgled, and choked, and sobbed in a desperate
effort to get the words out of his mouth in a hurry.

"I don't know, I don't know!" he cried. "We don't know anything about
the Carrier Indian. Honestly, we don't, Colonel. We just got orders
to stop you and these two kids from getting to San Diego. We only got
orders to stop them from going aboard the Indian. We don't know nothing
about her, honest to Pete. We don't even know why our boss didn't want
them two kids to go aboard. That's the truth, on my word of honor."

"You have no honor!" the Colonel told him coldly. Then he slowly
sighted the gun on a point between the pilot's eyes. "Well?" he
demanded. "You tell me then!"

The pilot turned white as a sheet under his beard, and looked as if he
were going to faint. His eyes popped way out, and spittle drooled out
the corners of his mouth.

"I don't know either!" he cried hoarsely. "So help me, Colonel, I'm
willing to spill everything I know. But I don't know a thing about the
Indian business. Go on, shoot me right between the eyes if I'm telling
you any lie. We just manned this station. And like he said, we got
orders to stop those two from going aboard the Indian. So help me!
That's the truth!"

Colonel Welsh hesitated, then shrugged and stuck the gun in his pocket.

"It was too much to hope for, anyway," he muttered more to himself.
"Let's get going. You lads get the plane started while I lug these two
outside. A mighty big day for America so far. Now, if only you two
can--"

The senior officer sighed and let the rest hang in the air. Then he
bent over, caught each man by the heels, and hauled them out into the
brilliant sunshine like a couple of logs. They yelped and babbled with
pain, but the Colonel had deaf ears. Twenty minutes later the two fifth
column prisoners were stowed aboard the Stinson, and the plane's props
were ticking over. Dave and Freddy had refilled the tanks from tins of
gas they found in the second shack. The shiny thing that Dave had seen
under the trees from the air proved to be a high speed Waco fitted with
two machine guns. For a moment they debated whether or not one of them
should fly it back. On second thought, though, they decided it was best
for them all to stick together in the same ship, and let somebody else
pick up the Waco later.

"Okay, all aboard!" Dave finally announced, and gave Freddy a friendly
slap on the back. "Go on and fly her, pal. You've sure earned the
honor. And, heck, my nerves can stand anything, now."

"I knew the compliment would have a nasty ending to it!" the English
youth growled, and shook his head. "No, fly her yourself. I've done my
share of work today. Besides, you know this neck of the world. I don't."

"Well, somebody fly it!" Colonel Welsh shouted from inside the cabin.
"We've still got to get to San Diego, you know. Come on, snap it up,
you two!"

"Okay!" Dave growled, and shouldered Freddy Farmer out of the way. "If
I must I must. Who was your slave last year, Mister?"

"Same chap," Freddy said with a chuckle. "And his good manners haven't
improved a bit. San Diego, my good man! And in a bit of a hurry,
please!"

"Very good, sir!" Dave grunted and made a face. "And you can guess what
I'm _thinking_!"




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

_Death Strikes Often_


A huge ball of gold and red hung balanced on the western lip of
the world. Shafts of shimmering fire radiated out from it in all
directions. They filled the sky with a mixture of shades that ranged
from a delicate pink to blood red. They bathed the earth with the same
hues, and seemed actually to creep into every nook and corner. The line
of planes on the San Diego field looked like the work of an imaginative
artist on nature's canvas rather than the real thing. It was a sight
to hold the eye and catch the breath--but Dave Dawson stared at it and
wasn't even conscious of what he was looking at.

He and Freddy Farmer were in the field Commandant's office, waiting for
Colonel Welsh to show up. But that was just the trouble. They had been
waiting for three solid hours for the Intelligence chief to return from
wherever he had gone. Three hours before Dave had put the Stinson down
on the field. At Colonel Welsh's order he had taxied it straight into
an empty hangar and cut the engines. The Colonel had jumped out and
disappeared for five minutes. He had returned with the field's C.O. and
a half dozen mechanics, and a closed car. The two fifth columnists had
been dumped in the car, and driven away. After hasty introductions to
the field Commandant, the Colonel had led them over to the field office
and told them to wait for him to return.

That had been three hours ago, and they were still waiting.

"Stop worrying, and come finish this food they sent over," Freddy
Farmer presently broke the silence. "Good grief, Dave, it doesn't do
any good to wear out the floor like that. Come on and have some more to
eat. Eggs, mind you! I haven't had an egg since I don't know when."

"You and your stomach!" Dave grated, and half turned from the window.
"You should choke on them. Look out there. The Indian! If they're
not getting ready to weigh anchor, then I'm nuts! Where is that guy,
anyway? He should have told us that--Jeepers!"

Freddy stopped some egg halfway to his mouth and looked up.

"What?" he demanded. "What's the matter?"

"The Colonel," Dave said with an effort. "I mean--I sure hope nothing's
happened to him."

Freddy Farmer considered that for a moment, then shrugged and carried
the egg the rest of the way to his mouth.

"Not likely, I think," he finally said. "Probably got those two chaps
to talk. Maybe it's made a difference. I mean, maybe he's decided to
call off this Indian show. Wouldn't mind that at all. They might post
us here at this field. Wonderful food, you know."

"It certainly _sounds_ good!" Dave cracked. Then, glancing out the
window again: "I sure hope they don't call off the show. That Indian
looks pretty nice to me out there. I could go for a trip on her.
Besides, I'm itching to take a whack or six at those dirty Japs. I
think I hate them worse than the Nazis, Freddy."

"Me, too, if that's possible," the English youth replied. "But I was
really talking just to hear myself. I'd like a trip on the Indian,
too. She's the latest of her class, and should have everything. Also,
according to the Colonel, she's steaming out to do battle. I could
fancy a little combat work. Doesn't pay to get rusty. My, but that meal
was good!"

"What a man!" Dave sighed at the window. "On an empty stomach he's not
worth a dime. Fill him up and he's a one man air force, and raring to
go. He's--"

Dave stopped short and wheeled quickly as the door opened and Colonel
Welsh came inside. The man's face was grim, and there was the look of
angry defeat in his eyes.

"Sorry I took so long, fellows," he said, and dropped into a chair. "I
had to check up on a few things, and get a few things underway. Took
longer than I figured."

"Those rats told the truth, eh?" Dave grunted. "They still don't know a
thing about the Indian?"

The Colonel shook his head and clenched his two fists in a helpless
gesture.

"Not a thing!" he got out savagely. "But they seem to be the only two
who don't."

"What do you mean by that, sir?" Freddy asked.

"Well, I don't mean it exactly the way I put it," the Colonel said with
a shake of his head. "But it seems the entire Axis organization in this
country has found out that their agent aboard the Indian has stolen the
battle plans of the carrier, and that I was to put four men aboard to
try and trap him and nail him to the mast. Those two agents of mine,
and you two."

"Your two agents got aboard last night, sir?" Dave prompted as the
senior officer stopped talking abruptly.

"No," was the bitter reply. "They were shot and killed as they stepped
into the waiting tender at the Navy pier."

"Shot?" Dave gasped. "Gee! That was tough. I hope the killers were
caught."

"They were, and captured dead," the Colonel said bluntly. "Two
waterfront rats. Looked that, anyway. One a Jap, obviously. The other
looked like a German. No papers or anything on him, though. So he could
have been almost any nationality. But the important thing is, that I
found the leak in my own organization. I put through a call to Captain
Lamb and he told me. He'd sent word to our San Diego office last night
for me to contact him at once. I called him, and--"

"The bloke reading the book in your outer office!" Freddy Farmer cried.

"The man who ran the elevator!" Dave exclaimed.

Colonel Welsh caught his breath and shot a hard look at Dawson.

"How did you know?" he demanded.

"I didn't," Dave replied. "But I had a hunch it might be one of those
two. It had to be somebody close to you, and--well, Freddy had already
picked the one in the outer office."

"It was the one who brought you up in the elevator," Colonel Welsh
said with an effort. "It's--it's things like this that almost make me
lose faith. That man had been in the bureau for six years. For four
years before that he was connected with Secret Service. His record was
spotless. And the amazing part is that he had performed some valuable
services for me. But that goes to show you the finesse of the Gestapo
and Nazi agent technique. Shows you how long ago Hitler laid plans for
America. I would have staked my life on Babson, but--"

The officer paused and gestured despairingly.

"But of course I would have lost my life!" he suddenly bit off. "But
for an accident I'd never have found out, perhaps. And who knows what
else that would have cost us? He was taking Lamb down late last night.
As he opened the doors a slip of paper fell out of his pocket. Lamb
caught it in mid-air, and was starting to hand it back when he saw
what was on the paper. It was a bit of code, obviously jotted down in
a hurry. But it was a code that only Lamb and I knew, not another
soul in the world. For years he and I have been working on a code that
can't possibly be broken down by any of the experts. We thought we had
found it. Kept our papers on it in a safe. Only Lamb and I knew the
combination--we thought."

"What happened, sir?" Freddy asked eagerly as Colonel Welsh let his
voice trail off into silence. "Did Captain Lamb make the dirty beggar
confess?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence shook his head.

"He didn't have time," he said. "Babson realized instantly that he'd
never in the world be able to explain his possession of that bit of
copied code. His only hope was quick action, and flight. He went for
his gun. Lamb didn't give me the details of the fight. He won, and
Babson is dead. Then Lamb got busy. He began with the little office
Babson used on the ground floor. He--It seems incredible! I thought
that Lamb was crazy, or blind drunk, and making it up. But he wasn't,
of course. Babson had actually installed a dictograph in our working
room. The other end was in his office. The wire led out behind the
files, under the corridor boards and down the elevator shaft, and
under the lobby floor to his office. He could hear every word we said
up there. How he learned that safe combination, we'll probably never
find out. In his Washington hotel room Lamb found enough stuff to hang
the man a dozen times over. Too bad we won't be able to do it. I feel
like going out and shooting myself. I'm the one responsible, of course.
One of my own trusted men! That's the worst of it!"

The Colonel gave a bewildered shake of his head, and groaned heavily.

"That's war, I guess," Dave murmured sympathetically. "And the same
thing has happened in other countries, sir. It isn't going to help any
to take it too hard, you know. Anyway, the rat is dead, and the leak is
plugged up. That's something, at least."

"But mighty little!" the Colonel said bitterly. Then, stabbing a
finger at the window facing the harbor, he grated, "There's the Indian
out there. In an hour she weighs anchor. Aboard her is the most
dangerous rat of all. He possesses information that could well mean the
difference between victory and defeat if it falls into Jap hands. We
can't hold the Indian. She's got to sail. Without her the whole battle
plan is mixed up. Yet if she sails and we don't catch that scoundrel,
who knows what will happen? I had hoped, but--well, now that's all
shot, too."

"What's all shot, sir?" Dave asked quickly.

"The job I had planned for you and Farmer aboard the Indian," the
Colonel replied. "It was a wild hope even at best, but now it isn't
even that. The rats know why I wanted you two aboard her. True, maybe
the man you're after doesn't know. I've a feeling, though, he does.
The way things have gone, I feel certain they got word to him somehow.
If they did, he'd know exactly why you were there the moment you came
over the side. And--well, to put it bluntly, he's killed twice already.
Twice more wouldn't bother him if he suspected you were getting close
to him. He'd--"

"We can watch our step," Dave cut in grimly.

"Too great a risk," the Colonel replied. "You see, it wouldn't be a
matter of your actually getting close, but the matter of his _thinking_
that you _were_ close. He'd know who you were, and why you were aboard.
The advantage would be all his. It would be unfair to ask any man to
tackle a job like that."

"I don't fancy so, sir," Freddy Farmer spoke up quietly. "After all,
rats usually do have all the advantage until you get them cornered.
Supposing he does know why we're there? Let him, I say. It's a job to
be done, and somebody's got to tackle it, sir. Good grief! If somebody
doesn't go after the blighter, it's like letting the Indian sail with a
lighted fuse leading to her powder magazine."

"I check on that, too, sir!" Dave cried eagerly. "Freddy and I aren't
trying to toot our horns, Colonel. Maybe we'll fall flat on our faces.
But maybe we won't. However, at least we'll be aboard in case something
does turn up that gives us a clue."

"Yes, of course," the Colonel grunted, and frowned. "That's quite true.
But you could be throwing your lives away--and uselessly, too. You two
helped accomplish something almost as big today, perhaps even bigger. I
can't say yet. But capturing those two American born rats was a mighty
big step toward smashing a lot of the Fifth Column business in this
country. I mean that, too. That place was one of their arsenals where
they've cached guns to be used when Berlin sends the order to strike
at the United States from within. It's one of several arsenals located
about the country. Those papers contained names and addresses of key
men in their organization. And right now some of my agents, and F.B.I.
agents, are waiting in that shack for the so-called big boss. His
capture alone will be something mighty big. Yes, you two played a major
part today in nipping something big in the bud. So it isn't fair to ask
you to--"

"Okay, okay!" Dave suddenly snapped. "If you don't think we rate a
crack at it, then have the Indian sail without us. I'm willing to take
the chance. So's Freddy. But if you think we'd mess up things, then
skip it. Let it slide."

The Colonel blinked and gave Dave a startled look. It wasn't every datian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of J
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
002:046 It happened after three days they found him in the temple,
        sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them,
        and asking them questions.
002:047 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
002:048 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother
        said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way?prophet.
013:021 Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son
        of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty yearf heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond treshall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
        or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken
        at the cistern,
012:007 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
        returns to God who gave it.
012:008 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
012:009 Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge.  Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set
        in order many proverbs.

No, mortals blended by terror! The friend of nature is not your enemy;
its interpreter is not the minister of falsehood; the destroyer of your
vain phantoms is not the devastator of those truths necessary to your
happiness; the disciple of reason is not an irrational being, who either
seeks to poison you, or to infect you with a dangerous delirium. If
he is desirous to wrest the thunder from those terrible theories that
affright ye, it is that ye way discontinue your march, in the midst
of storms, over roads that ye can only distinguish by the sudden, but
evanescent glimmerings of the electric fluid. If he breaks those idols,
which fear has served with myrrh and frankencense--which superstition
has surrounded by gloomy despondency--which fanaticism has imbrued with
blood; it is to substitute in their place those consoling truths that
are calculated to heal the desperate wounds ye have received; that are
suitable to inspire you with courage, sturdily to oppose yourselves
to such dangerous errors; that have power to enable you to resist such
formidable enemies. If he throws down the temples, overturns the altars,
so frequently bathed with the bitter tears of the unfortunate, blackened
by the most cruel sacrifices, smoked with servile incense, it is that he
may erect a fane sacred to peace; a hall dedicated to reason; a durable
monument to virtue, in which ye may at all times find an asylum against
your own phrenzy; a refuge from your own ungovernable passions; a
sanctuary against those powerful dogmatists, by whom ye are oppressed.
If he attacks the haughty pretensions of deified tyrants, who crush ye
with an iron sceptre, it is that ye may enjoy the rights of your nature;
it is to the end that ye may be substantively freemen, in mind as well
as in body; that ye may not be slaves, eternally chained to the oar of
misery; it is that ye may at length be governed by men who are citizens,
who may cherish their own semblances, who way protect mortals like
themselves, who may actually consult the interests of those from
whom they hold their power. If he battles with imposture, it is to
re-establish truth in those rights which have been so long usurped by
fiction. If he undermines the base of that unsteady, fanatical morality,
which has hitherto done nothing more than perplex your minds, without
correcting your hearts; it is to give to ethics an immovable basis, a
solid foundation, secured upon your own nature; upon the reciprocity of
those wants which are continually regenerating in sensible beings: dare,
then, to listen to his voice; you will find it much more intelligible
than those ambiguous oracles, which are announced to you as the
offspring of capricious theories; as imperious decrees that are
unceasingly at variance with themselves. Listen then to nature, she
never contradicts her own eternal laws.

"O thou!" cries this nature to man, "who, following the impulse I
have given you, during your whole existence, incessantly tend towards
happiness, do not strive to resist my sovereign law. Labour to your own
felicity; partake without fear of the banquet which is spread before
you, with the most hearty welcome; you will find the means legibly
written on your own heart. Vainly dost thou, O superstitious being! seek
after thine happiness beyond the limits of the universe, in which my
hand hath placed thee: vainly shalt thou search it in those inexorable
theories, which thine imagination, ever prone to wander, would establish
upon my eternal throne: vainly dost thou expect it in those fanciful
regions, to which thine own delirium hath given a locality and a shame:
vainly dost thou reckon upon capricious systems, with whose advantages
thou art in such ecstasies; whilst they only fill thine abode with
calamity--thine heart with dread--thy mind with illusions--thy bosom
with groans. Know that when thou neglectest my counsels, the gods will
refuse their aid. Dare, then, to affranchise thyself from the trammels
of superstition, my self-conceited, pragmatic rival, who mistakes
my rights; renounce those empty theories, which are usurpers of my
privileges; return under the dominion of my laws, which, however severe,
are mild in comparison with those of bigotry. It is in my empire
alone that true liberty reigns. Tyranny is unknown to its soil; equity
unceasingly watches over the rights of all my subjects, maintains
them in the possession of their just claims; benevolence, grafted upon
humanity, connects them by amicable bonds; truth enlightens them; never
can imposture blind them with his obscuring mists. Return, then,
my child, to thy fostering mother's arms! Deserter, trace back thy
wandering steps to nature! She will console thee for thine evils; she
will drive from thine heart those appalling fears which overwhelm thee;
those inquietudes that distract thee; those transports which agitate
thee; those hatreds that separate thee from thy fellow man, whom thou
shouldst love as thyself. Return to nature, to humanity, to thyself!
Strew flowers over the road of life: cease to contemplate the future;
live to thine own happiness; exist for thy fellow creatures; retire into
thyself, examine thine own heart, then consider the sensitive beings by
whom thou art surrounded: leave to their inventors those systems which
can effect nothing towards thy felicity. Enjoy thyself, and cause others
also to enjoy, those comforts which I have placed with a liberal hand,
for all the children of the earth; who all equally emanate from my
bosom: assist them to support the sorrows to which necessity has
submitted them in common with thyself. Know, that I approve thy
pleasures, when without injuring thyself, they are not fatal to thy
brethren, whom I have rendered indispensably necessary to thine own
individual happiness. These pleasures are freely permitted thee, if thou
indulgest them with moderation; with that discretion which I myself have
fixed. Be happy, then, O man! Nature invites thee to participate in it;
but always remember, thou canst not be so alone; because I invite all
mortals to happiness as well as thyself; thou will find it is only in
securing their felicity that thou canst consolidate thine own. Such is
the decree of thy destiny: if thou shalt attempt to withdraw thyself
from its operation, recollect that hatred will pursue thee; vengeance
overtake thy steps; and remorse be ever ready at hand to punish the
infractions of its irrevocable mandates.

"Follow then, O man! in whatever station thou findest thyself, the
routine I have described for thee, to obtain that happiness to which
thou hast an indispensable right to challenge pretension. Let the
sensations of humanity interest thee for the condition of other men, who
are thy fellow creatures; let thine heart have commisseration for their
misfortunes: let thy generous hand spontaneously stretch forth to lend
succour to the unhappy mortal who is overwhelmed by his destiny; always
bearing in thy recollection, that it may fall heavy upon thyself, as
it now does upon him. Acknowledge, then, without guile, that every
unfortunate has an inalienable right to thy kindness. Above all, wipe
from the eyes of oppressed innocence the trickling crystals of agonized
feeling; let the tears of virtue in distress, fall upon thy sympathizing
bosom; let the genial glow of sincere friendship animate thine honest
heart; let the fond attachment of a mate, cherished by thy warmest
affection, make thee forget the sorrows of life: be faithful to her
love, responsible to her tenderness, that she may reward thee by
a reciprocity of feeling; that under the eyes of parents united in
virtuous esteem, thy offspring may learn to set a proper value on
practical virtue; that after having occupied thy riper years, they may
comfort thy declining age, gild with content thy setting sun, cheer the
evening of thine existence, by a dutiful return of that care which thou
shalt have bestowed on their imbecile infancy.

"Be just, because equity is the support of human society! Be good,
because goodness connects all hearts in adamantine bonds! Be indulgent,
because feeble thyself, thou livest with beings who partake of thy
weakness! Be gentle, because mildness attracts attention! Be thankful,
because gratitude feeds benevolence, nourishes generosity! Be modest,
because haughtiness is disgusting to beings at all times well with
themselves. Forgive injuries, because revenge perpetuates hatred! Do
good to him who injureth thee, in order to shew thyself more noble than
he is; to make a friend of him, who was once thine enemy! Be reserved
in thy demeanor, temperate in thine enjoyment, chaste in thy pleasures,
because voluptuousness begets weariness, intemperance engenders disease;
forward manners are revolting: excess at all times relaxes the springs
of thy machine, will ultimately destroy thy being, and render thee
hateful to thyself, contemptible to others.

"Be a faithful citizen; because the community is necessary to thine own
security; to the enjoyment of thine own existence; to the furtherance
of thine own happiness. Be loyal, but be brave; submit to legitimate
authority; because it is requisite to the maintenance of that society
which is necessary to thyself. Be obedient to the laws; because they
_are_, or _ought to be_, the expression of the public will, to which
thine own particular will ought ever to be subordinate. Defend thy
country with zeal; because it is that which renders thee happy, which
contains thy property, as well as those beings dearest to thine heart:
do not permit this common parent of thyself, as well as of thy fellow
citizens, to fall under the shackles of tyranny; because from thence
it will be no more than thy common prison. If thy country, deaf to the
equity of thy claims, refuses thee happiness--if, submitted to an unjust
power, it suffers thee to be oppressed, withdraw thyself from its bosom
in silence, but never disturb its peace.

"In short, be a man; be a sensible, rational being; be a faithful
husband; a tender father; an equitable master; a zealous citizen; labour
to serve thy country by thy prowess; by thy talents; by thine industry;
above all, by thy virtues. Participate with thine associates those gifts
which nature has bestowed upon thee; diffuse happiness, among thy fellow
mortals; inspire thy fellow citizens with content; spread joy over all
those who approach thee, that the sphere of thine actions, enlivened by
thy kindness, illumined by thy benevolence, may re-act upon thyself; be
assured that the man who makes others happy cannot himself be miserable.
In thus conducting thyself, whatever may be the injustice of others,
whatever may be the blindness of those beings with whom it is thy
destiny to live, thou wilt never be totally bereft of the recompense
which is thy due; no power on earth be able to ravish from thee that
never failing source of the purest felicity, inward content; at each
moment thou wilt fall back with pleasure upon thyself; thou wilt neither
feel the rankling of shame, the terror of internal alarm, nor find
thy heart corroded by remorse. Thou wilt esteem thyself; thou wilt be
cherished by the virtuous, applauded and loved by all good men, whose
suffrages are much more valuable than those of the bewildered
multitude. Nevertheless, if externals occupy thy contemplation, smiling
countenances will greet thy presence; happy faces will express the
interest they have in thy welfare; jocund beings will make thee
participate in their placid feelings. A life so spent, will each moment
be marked by the serenity of thine own soul, by the affection of the
beings who environ thee; will be made cheerful by the friendship of thy
fellows; will enable thee to rise a contented, satisfied guest from the
general feast; conduct thee gently down the declivity of life, lead thee
peaceably to the period of thy days; for die thou must: but already
thou wilt survive thyself in thought; thou wilt always live in the
remembrance of thy friends; in the grateful recollection of those beings
whose comforts have been augmented by thy friendly attentions; thy
virtues will, beforehand have erected to thy fame an imperishable
monument: if heaven occupies itself with thee, it will feel satisfied
with thy conduct, when it shall thus have contented the earth.

"Beware, then, how thou complainest of thy condition; be just, be kind,
be virtuous, and thou canst never be wholly destitute of felicity. Take
heed how thou enviest the transient pleasure of seductive crime; the
deceitful power of victorious tyranny; the specious tranquillity of
interested imposture; the plausible manners of venal justice; the shewy,
ostentatious parade of hardened opulence. Never be tempted to increase
the number of sycophants to an ambitious despot; to swell the catalogue
of slaves to an unjust tyrant; never suffer thyself to be allured to
infamy, to the practice of extortion, to the commission of outrage, by
the fatal privilege of oppressing thy fellows; always recollect it will
be at the expence of the most bitter remorse thou wilt acquire this
baneful advantage. Never be the mercenary accomplice of the spoilers of
thy country; they are obliged to blush secretly whenever they meet the
public eye.

"For, do not deceive thyself, it is I who punish, with an unerring hand,
all the crimes of the earth; the wicked may escape the laws of man, but
they never escape mine. It is I who have formed the hearts, as well
an the bodies of mortals; it is I who have fixed the laws which govern
them. If thou deliverest thyself up to voluptuous enjoyment, the
companions of thy debaucheries may applaud thee; but I shall punish thee
with the most cruel infirmities; these will terminate a life of shame
with deserved contempt. If thou givest, thyself up to intemperate
indulgences, human laws may not correct thee, but I shall castigate thee
severely by abridging thy days. If thou art vicious, thy fatal habits
will recoil on thine own head. Princes, those terrestrial divinities,
whose power places them above the laws of mankind, are nevertheless
obliged to tremble under the silent operation of my decrees. It is I who
chastise them; it is I who fill their breasts with suspicion; it is
I who inspire them with terror; it is I who make them writhe under
inquietude; it is I who make them shudder with horror, at the very name
of august truth; it is I who, amidst the crowd of nobles who surround
them, make them feel the inward workings of shame; the keen anguish of
guilt; the poisoned arrows of regret; the cruel stings of remorse; it is
I who, when they abuse my bounty, diffuse weariness over their benumbed
souls; it is I who follow uncreated, eternal justice; it is I who,
without distinction of persons, know how to make the balance even; to
adjust the chastisement to the fault; to make the misery bear its due
proportion to the depravity; to inflict punishment commensurate with the
crime. The laws of man are just, only when they are in conformity with
mine; his judgements are rational, only when I have dictated them: my
laws alone are immutable, universal, irrefragable; formed to regulate
the condition of the human race, in all ages, in all places, under all
circumstances.

"If thou doubtest mine authority, if thou questionest the irresistible
power I possess over mortals, contemplate the vengeance I wreak on all
those who resist my decrees. Dive into the recesses of the hearts of
those various criminals, whose countenances, assuming a forced smile,
cover souls torn with anguish. Dost thou not behold ambition tormented
day and night, with an ardour which nothing can extinguish? Dost not
thou see the mighty conquerer become the lord of devastated solitudes;
his victorious career, marked by a blasted cultivation, reign
sorrowfully over smoking ruins; govern unhappy wretches who curse him in
their hearts; while his soul, gnawed by remorse, sickens at the gloomy
aspect of his own triumphs? Dost thou believe that the tyrant, encircled
with his flatterers, who stun him with their praise, is unconscious of
the hatred which his oppression excites; of the contempt which his vices
draw upon him; of the sneers which his inutility call forth; of the
scorn which his debaucheries entail upon his name? Dost thou think that
the haughty courtier does not inwardly blush at the galling insults he
brooks; despise, from the bottom of his soul, those meannesses by
which he is compelled to purchase favours; feel at his heart's core the
wretched dependence in which his cupidity places him.

"Contemplate the indolent child of wealth, behold him a prey to the
lassitude of unmeasured enjoyment, corroded by the satiety which always
follows his exhausted pleasures. View the miser with an emaciated
countenance, the consequence of his own penurious disposition, whose
callous heart is inaccessible to the calls of misery, groaning over the
accumulating load of useless treasure, which at the expense of himself,
he has laboured to amass. Behold the gay voluptuary, the smiling
debaucheé, secretly lament the health they have so inconsiderately
damaged so prodigally thrown away: see disdain, joined to hatred, reign
between those adulterous married couples, who have reciprocally violated
the sacred vows they mutually pledged at the altar of Hymen; whose
appetencies have rendered them the scorn of the world; the jest of their
acquaintance; polluted tributaries to the surgeon. See the liar
deprived of all confidence; the knave stript of all trust; the hypocrite
fearfully avoiding the penetrating looks of his inquisitive neighbour;
the impostor trembling at the very name of formidable truth. Bring under
your review the heart of the envious, uselessly dishonored; that withers
at the sight of his neighbour's prosperity. Cast your eyes on the frozen
soul of the ungrateful wretch, whom no kindness can warm, no benevolence
thaw, no beneficence convert into a genial fluid. Survey the iron
feelings of that monster whom the sighs of the unfortunate cannot
mollify. Behold the revengeful being nourished with venemous gall, whose
very thoughts are serpents; who in his rage consumes himself. Envy, if
thou canst, the waking slumbers of the homicide; the startings of the
iniquitous judge; the restlessness of the oppressor of innocence; the
fearful visions of the extortioner; whose couches are infested with the
torches of the furies. Thou tremblest without doubt at the sight of
that distraction which, amidst their splendid luxuries, agitates those
farmers of the revenue, who fatten upon public calamnity--who devour the
substance of the orphan--who consume the means of the widow--who grind
the hard earnings of the poor: thou shudderest at witnessing the remorse
which rends the souls of those reverend criminals, whom the uninformed
believe to be happy, whilst the contempt which they have for themselves,
the unerring shafts of secret upbraidings, are incessantly revenging
an outraged nation. Thou seest, that content is for ever banished the
heart; quiet for ever driven from the habitations of those miserable
wretches on whose minds I have indelibly engraved the scorn, the infamy,
the chastisement which they deserve. But, no! thine eyes cannot sustain
the tragic spectacle of my vengeance. Humanity obliges thee to partake
of their merited sufferings; thou art moved to pity for these unhappy
people, to whom consecrated errors renders vice necessary; whose fatal
habits make them familiar with crime. Yes; thou shunnest them without
hating them; thou wouldst succour them, if their contumacious perversity
had left thee the means. When thou comparest thine own condition, when
thou examinest thine own soul, thou wilt have just cause to felicitate
thyself, if thou shalt find that peace has taken up her abode with thee;
that contentment dwells at the bottom of thine own heart. In short, thou
seest accomplished upon them, as well as, upon thyself, the unalterable
decrees of destiny, which imperiously demand, that crime shall punish
itself, that virtue never shall be destitute Of remuneration."

Such is the sum of those truths which are contained in the _Code of
Nature_; such are the doctrines, which its disciples can announce. They
are unquestionably preferable to that supernatural superstition which
never does any thing but mischief to the human species. Such is the
worship that is taught by that sacred reason, which is the object of
contempt with the theologian; which meets the insult of the fanatic;
who only estimates that which man can neither conceive nor practise; who
make his morality consist in fictitious duties; his virtue in actions
generally useless, frequently pernicious to the welfare of society; who
for want of being acquainted with nature, which is before their eyes,
believe themselves obliged to seek in ideal worlds imaginary motives, of
which every thing proves the inefficacy. The motive which the morality
of nature employs, is the self-evident interest of each individual,
of each community, of the whole human species, in all times, in every
country, under all circumstances. Its worship is the sacrifice of vice,
the practise of real virtues; its object is the conservation of the
human race, the happiness of the individual, the peace of mankind;
its recompences are affection, esteem, and glory; or in their default,
contentment of mind, with merited self-esteem, of which no power will
ever be able to deprive virtuous mortals; its punishments, are hatred,
contempt, and indignation; which society always reserves for those
who outrage its interests; from which even the most powerful can never
effectually shield themselves.

Those nations who shall be disposed to practise a morality so wise, who
shall inculcate it in infancy, whose laws shall unceasingly confirm it,
will neither have occasion for superstition, nor for chimeras. Those
who shall obstinately prefer figments to their dearest interests, will
certainly march forward to ruin. If they maintain themselves for a
season, it is because the power of nature sometimes drives them back to
reason, in despite of those prejudices which appear to lead them on to
certain destruction. Superstition, leagued with tyranny, for the waste
of the human species, are themselves frequently obliged to implore
the assistance of a reason which they contemn; of a nature which they
disdain; which they debase; which they endeavour to crush under the
ponderous bulk of artificial theories. Superstition, in all times so
fatal to mortals, when attacked by reason, assumes the sacred mantle of
public utility; rests its importance on false grounds, founds its
rights upon the indissoluble alliance which it pretends subsists between
morality and itself; notwithstanding it never ceases for a single
instant to wage against it the most cruel hostility. It is,
unquestionably, by this artifice, that it has seduced so many sages.
In the honesty of their hearts, they believe it useful to politics;
necessary to restrain the ungovernable fury of the passions; thus
hypocritical superstition, in order to mask to superficial observers,
its own hideous character, like the ass with the lion's skin, always
knows how to cover itself with the sacred armour of utility; to buckle
on the invulnerable shield of virtue; it has therefore, been believed
imperative to respect it, notwithstanding it felt awkward under these
incumbrances; it consequently has become a duty to favor imposture,
because it has artfully entrenched itself behind the altars of truth;
its ears, however, discover its worthlessness; its natural cowardice
betrays itself; it is from this intrenchment we ought to drive it; it
should be dragged forth to public view; stripped of its surreptitious
panoply; exposed in its native deformity; in order that the human race
may become acquainted with its dissimulation; that mankind may have a
knowledge of its crimes; that the universe may behold its sacrilegious
hands, armed with homicidal poniards, stained with the blood of nations,
whom it either intoxicates with its fury, or immolates without pity to
the violence of its passions.

The MORALITY OF NATURE is the only creed which her interpreter offers to
his fellow citizens; to nations; to the human species; to future races,
weaned from those prejudices which have so frequently disturbed the
felicity of their ancestors. The friend of mankind cannot be the friend
of delusion, which at all times has been a real scourge to the earth.
The APOSTLE OF NATURE will not be the instrument of deceitful chimeras,
by which this world is made only an abode of illusions; the adorer of
truth will not compromise with falsehood; he will make no covenant with
error; conscious it must always be fatal to mortals. He knows that the
happiness of the human race imperiously exacts that the dark unsteady
edifice of superstition should be razed to its foundations; in order
to elevate on its ruins a temple suitable to peace--a fane sacred to
virtue. He feels it is only by extirpating, even to the most slender
fibres, the poisonous tree, that during so many ages has overshadowed
the universe, that the inhabitants of this world will be able to use
their own optics--to bear with steadiness that light which is competent
to illumine their understanding--to guide their wayward steps--to give
the necessary ardency to their souls. If his efforts should be vain; if
he cannot inspire with courage, beings too much accustomed to tremble;
he will, at least, applaud himself for having dared the attempt.
Nevertheless, he will not judge his exertions fruitless, if he has
only been enabled to make a single mortal happy: if his principles have
calmed the conflicting transports of one honest soul; if his reasonings
have cheered up some few virtuous hearts. At least he will have the
advantage of having banished from his own mind the importunate terror
of superstition; of having expelled from his own heart the gall which
exasperates zeal; of having trodden under foot those chimeras with which
the uninformed are tormented. Thus, escaped from the peril of the storm,
he will calmly contemplate from the summit of his rock, those tremendous
hurricanes which superstition excites; he will hold forth a succouring
hand to those who shall be willing to accept it; he will encourage them
with his voice; he will second them with his best exertions, and in the
warmth of his own compassionate heart, he will exclaim:

O NATURE; sovereign of all beings! and ye, her adorable daughters,
VIRTUE, REASON, and TRUTH! remain for ever our revered protectors: it is
to you that belong the praises of the human race; to you appertains the
homage of the earth. Shew, us then, O NATURE! that which man ought
to do, in order to obtain the happiness which thou makest him desire.
VIRTUE! Animate him with thy beneficent fire. REASON! Conduct his
uncertain steps through the paths of life. TRUTH! Let thy torch illumine
his intellect, dissipate the darkness of his road. Unite, O assisting
deities! your powers, in order to submit the hearts of mankind to
your dominion. Banish error from our mind; wickedness from our hearts;
confusion from our footsteps; cause knowledge to extend its salubrious
reign; goodness to occupy our souls; serenity to dwell in our bosoms.
Let imposture, confounded, never again dare to shew its head. Let our
eyes, so long, either dazzled or blindfolded, be at length fixed
upon those objects we ought to seek. Dispel for ever those mists
of ignorance, those hideous phantoms, together with those seducing
chimeras, which only serve to lead us astray. Extricate us from that
dark abyss into which we are plunged by superstition; overthrow the
fatal empire of delusion; crumble the throne of falsehood; wrest from
their polluted hands the power they have usurped. Command men, without
sharing your authority with mortals: break the chains that bind them
down in slavery: tear away the bandeau by which they are hoodwinked;
allay the fury that intoxicates them; break in the hands of sanguinary,
lawless tyrants, that iron sceptre with which they are crushed to
exile; the imaginary regions, from whence fear has imported them, those
theories by which they are afflicted. Inspire the intelligent being with
courage; infuse energy into his system, that, at length, he may feel his
own dignity; that he may dare to love himself; to esteem his own actions
when they are worthy; that a slave only to your eternal laws, he may no
longer fear to enfranchise himself from all other trammels; that blest
with freedom, he may have the wisdom to cherish his fellow creature; and
become happy by learning to perfection his own condition; instruct him
in the great lesson, that the high road to felicity, is prudently to
partake himself, and also to cause others to enjoy, the rich banquet
which thou, O Nature! hast so bountifully set before him. Console thy
children for those sorrows to which their destiny submits them, by
those pleasures which wisdom allows them to partake; teach them to be
contented with their condition; to banish envy from their mind; to yield
silently to necessity. Conduct them without alarm to that period which
all beings must find; _let them learn that time changes all things, that
consequently they are made neither to avoid its scythe nor to fear its
arrival._





[TRANSLATOR'S APPENDIX]

A BRIEF SKETCH

OF THE

LIFE AND WRITINGS

OF

M. DE. MIRABAUD.


At a time when we are on the eve of an important change in our
political affairs, which must evidently lead either to the recovery and
re-establishment of our liberties, or to a military despotism, those who
are connected with the press ought to use every exertion to enlighten
their fellow-citizens, and to assert their right of canvassing, in the
most free and unrestrained manner, every subject connected with the
happiness of man.

The priesthood have ever been convenient tools in the hands of
tyrants, to keep the bulk of the people in a degraded servility. By the
superstitious and slavish doctrines which they infuse into their minds,
they prevent them from thinking for themselves and asserting their own
independence. At a moment when national schools are erecting in every
quarter of the country, not with a sincere desire of enlightening the
rising generation, but with the insidious design of instilling into
their minds the doctrines of "Church and King," in order to bolster up
a little longer the present rotten, tottering, and corrupt system: at
a moment, too, when thousands of fanatic preachers are traversing the
country, with a view to subjugate the human mind to the baleful empire
of visonary enthusiasm and sectarian bigotry to the utter extinction
of every noble, manly, liberal, and pilanthropic principle;--at such a
moment as this, we thought that the "SYSTEM OF NATURE" could not fail
to render essential service to the cause both of civil and religious
liberty. No work, ancient or modern, has surpassed it, in the eloquence
and sublimity of its language, or in the facility with which it treats
the most abtruse and difficult subjects. It is, without exception, the
boldest effort the human mind has yet produced, in the investigation
of morals and theology--in the destruction of priestcraft and
superstition--and in developing the sources of all those passions and
prejudices which have proved so fatal to the tranquillity of the world.

The republic of letters has never produced an author whose pen was so
well calculated to emancipate mankind from all those trammels with which
the nurse, the schoolmaster and the priest have successively locked
up their noblest faculties, before they were capable of reasoning and
judging for themselves. The frightful apprehensions of the gloomy
bigot, and all the appalling terrors of superstition, are here utterly
annihilated, to the complete satisfaction of every unbiassed and
impartial person.--These we considered as necessary observations to
make, previous to any attempt at the biography of the author.

Biography may be reckoned among the most interesting of literary
productions. Its intrinsic value is such, that, though capable of
extraordinary embellishment from the hand of genius, yet no inferiority
of execution can so degrade it, as to deprive it of utility. Whatever
relates even to man in general, considered only as an aggregate of
active and intelligent beings, has a strong claim upon our notice; but
that which relates to our author, as distinguished from the rest of his
species, moving in a more exalted sphere, and towering above them by
the resplendent excellencies of his mind, seems to me to be peculiarly
calculated for our contemplation, and ought to form the highest pleasure
of our lives. There is a principle of curiosity implanted in us, which
leads us, in an especial manner, to investigate our fellow creatures;
the eager inquisitiveness with which the mechanic seeks to know the
history of his fellow-workmen and the ardour with which the philosopher,
the poet, or the historian hunts for details that may familiarize
him with, a Descartes or a Newton, with a Milton, a Hume, or a
Gibbon--spring from the same source. Their object, however, may
perhaps vary; for, in the former, it may be for the sake of detraction,
invidious cavil, or malice; in the latter, it is a sweet homage paid by
the human heart to the memory of departed genius.

It has been repeatedly observed that the life of a scholar affords few
materials for biography. This is only negatively true;--could every
scholar have a Boswell, the remark would vanish; or were every scholar
a Rousseau, a Gibbon, or a Cumberland it would be equally nugatory.
What can present higher objects of contemplation--what can claim
more forcibly our attention--where can we seek for subjects of a more
precious nature, than in the elucidation of the operations of mind,
the acquisition of knowledge, the gradual expansion of genius; its
application, its felicities, its sorrows, its wreaths of fame, its cold,
undeserved neglect? Such scenes, painted by, the artist himself, are a
rich bequest to mankind: even when traced by the hand of friendship
or the pencil of admiration, they possess a permanent interest in our
hearts. I cannot conceive a life more worthy of public notice, more
important, more interesting to human nature, than the life of a literary
man, were it executed according to the ideas I have formed of it: did
it exhibit a faithful delineation of the progress of intellect, from the
cradle upwards; did it portray, in accurate colors, the production of
what we call genius: by what accident it was first awakened; what were
its first tendencies; how directed to a particular object; by what means
it was nourished and unfolded; the gradual progress of its operation
in the production of a work; its hopes and fears; its delights; its
miseries; its inspirations; and all the thousand fleeting joys that so
often invest its path but for a moment, and then fade like the dews
of the morning. Let it contain too a transcript of the many nameless
transports that float round the heart, that dance in the gay circle
before the ardent gazing eye, when the first conception of some future
effort strikes the mind; how it pictures undefined delights of fame and
popular applause; how it anticipates the bright moments of invention,
and dwells with prophetic ecstasy on the felicitous execution of
particular parts, that already start into existence by the magic touch
of a heated imagination. Let it depict the tender feelings of solitude,
the breathings of midnight silence, the scenes of mimic life, of imaged
trial, that often occupy the musing mind; let it be such a work, so
drawn, so coloured, and who shall pronounce it inferior? Who rather
will not confess that it presents a picture of human nature, where every
heart may find some corresponding harmony? When, therefore, it is said,
that the life of a scholar is barren, it is so only because it has never
been properly delineated; because those parts only have been selected
which are common, and fail to distinguish him from the common man;
because we have never penetrated into his closet, or into his heart;
because we have drawn him only as an outward figure, and left unnoticed
that internal structure that would delight, astonish, and improve. And
then, when we compare the life of such a man with the more active one
of a soldier, a statesman, or a lawyer, we pronounce it insipid,
uninteresting. True;--the man of study has not fought for hire--he has
not slaughtered at the command of a master: he would disdain to do
so. Though unaccompanied with the glaring actions of public men, which
confound and dazzle by their publicity, but shrink from the estimation
of moral truth, it would present a far nobler picture; yes, and a more
instructive one:--the calm disciple of reason meditates in silence; he
walks his road with innoxious humility; he is poor, but his mind is his
treasure; he cultivates his reason, and she lifts him to the pinnacle of
truth; he learns to tear away the veil of self-love, folly, pride, and
prejudice, and bares the human heart to his inspection; he corrects and
amends; he repairs the breaches made by passion; the proud man passes
him by, and looks upon him with scorn; but he feels his own worth, that
ennobling consciousness which swells in every vein, and inspires him
with true pride--with manly independence: to such a man I could sooner
bow in reverence, than to the haughtiest, most successful candidate for
the world's ambition. But of such men, for the reason I have already
mentioned, our information is scanty. While of others, who have
commanded a greater share of public notoriety, venal or mistaken
admiration has given more than we wished to know. Among these respected
individuals of human nature, may be placed Mirabaud. Had Mirabaud been
an Englishman, who doubts but that we should have possessed at least
ample details of the usual subjects of biographical notice; while all
that has been collected among his own countrymen, is a scanty memoir in
a common dictionary. That we are doomed to remain ignorant of the life
of such men, speaks a loud disgrace.--I lament it.

JOHN BAPTISTE MIRABAUD, was born at Paris in the year 1674. He
prosecuted his infantile studies under the direction of his parents, and
was afterwards entered a member of the _Congregation of the Priests of
the Oratory_, where he passed several years, and produced some very bold
writings, which were never intended for publication.

He was subsequently appointed tutor to the princesses of the House of
Orleans, and then took the resolution of destroying the greater part of
the manuscripts that he produced while a member of the _Congregation_;
but the treachery of some of his friends, to whom he had confided his
manuscripts, rendered this precaution useless, for some of his works
were published during the time he remained the preceptor to his royal
pupils; among which number may be reckoned his "New Liberties of
Thought," a work but little calculated for gaining him friends in the
purlieus of the Court of Orleans. The "Origin and Antiquity of the
World," in three parts, was also published at this period, and from the
publication of this work, may be dated the resolution of M. de Mirabaud
to quit his office of preceptor, which he relinquished, having become
more independent; he now gave himself up entirely to his philosophical
studies, and produced the "System of Nature," with which he was assisted
by Diderot, D'Alembert, Baron D'Olbac, and others.

The profound metaphysical knowledge displayed throughout the System
of Nature, and the doctrines which are therein advanced, warrants the
conclusion, that it is at once the most decisive, boldest, and most
extraordinary work, that the human understanding ever had the courage to
produce. The study of metaphysics his generally been considered the most
terrific to the indolent mind; but the clear and perspicuous reasoning
of a Mirabaud, who has united the most profound argument, with the most
fascinating eloquence, charm and instruct us at the same time. But it
was not, to be expected that such doctrines as are contained in the
System of Nature, would be advanced without meeting with some opposition
from the superficial and bigoted metaphysicians, who feel an interest
in upholding a system of delusion and superstition. No! certainly not,
Their interest was threatened, and their _craft_ in danger, and the
consequence was, that the _Atheist_ or _Disciple of Nature_, has
been abused with every scurrilous epithet, "full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

Atheism is stigmatized with having "opened a wide door for libertinism,
destroying the social and moral compact; and striking a deadly blow
at religion. It is asserted that the atheist, who by his opinions has
deprived himself of the hope and consolation of a future life, has no
motive for the practise of virtue, or to contribute to the well being of
society. Deprived of a chimera which religion every where presents him,
he wanders through the cheerless gloom of scepticism, regardless of the
consequences of an abandoned life. Without a God, he acknowledges no
benefactor; without divine laws, he knows no rule for the conduct of
life, and submits to no law but his passions. An enemy to all social
order, he spurns at human laws, and breaks through every barrier opposed
to his wickedness." Under such colours is an atheist painted: a short
digression must be suffered to examine this picture, and to disprove the
assertions so sweepingly made.

I admit that atheism strikes a deadly blow at religion; because under
the cloak of religion, mankind have been oppressed in all ages; but that
it encourages libertinism, or destroys the "social and moral compact," I
have yet to learn. In all organized governments, men are restrained from
crime and compelled to submission by laws supposed to be made for the
general benefit. These laws are the effect of the first formation of
society for mutual preservation. Here then is a sufficient motive
for the one as well as the other, to contribute to the well-being of
society. The laws of Nature are the same in effect on the atheist
and the religionist. If man be led captive by his passions, and gives
himself to debauchery and voluptuousness, nature will punish him with
bodily infirmities and a debilitated mind. If he be intemperate, she
will shorten his days and bring him to the grave with the most poignant
remorse. The fatal effects of his vicious propensities will fall upon
his own head. A disturber of social order will live in continual fear
of the vengeance of society, and that very fear is a more dreadful
punishment than the just vengeance which perhaps he escapes. It renders
life burdensome, and makes a man hateful to himself. Can men have
stronger motives for the practise of virtue? The atheist is in full
possession of these motives, and the religionist is most completely
swayed by them, whatever may be his pretensions to others derived
from religion. But we are assured he has other motives; more powerful
incentives, in the promise of future rewards and punishments. This, like
all other chimerical doctrines, cannot be maintained if we look at the
general practise of mankind. Let us trace the effects of this doctrine,
or rather let us examine the actions, conduct, and character of men
professing it, and we shall see how little influence it has over them.
The bulk of society believe they shall answer in a future life for the
deeds done in the present. Nay, I hardly think one in a hundred thousand
will say they doubt it. What then is its effect? With this dreadful
sentence, _"Thou shalt go into everlasting punishment,"_ continually
sounded in their ears, do we not daily see the greatest enormities
committed? Are not the most horrid crimes perpetrated in all parts
of the world? The most vicious propensities and the most extravagant
follies are almost indiscriminately gratified. Is not vice frequently
triumphant, and virtue compelled to seek her own reward in retirement?
The laws of society are broken by the most flagrant injustice, and the
laws of nature outraged by the most shocking depravity. All this evil
exists in nations believing themselves to be accountable beings after
death. Where then are the beneficial effects arising, to mankind from
the promulgation of this doctrine? Men who cannot be restrained from
doing evil by human laws, have no dread of any other. Their whole lives
and conduct confirm this. Others who live in submission to the laws of
society, give themselves up to those vicious habits, (without fear of
divine laws) which the law does not take cognizance of. Men, not wholly
depraved, or not without the pale of society, generally respect the
laws, and fear the bad opinion of others. Hence we observe, when
interest or passion leads them into secret vices, they invariably play
the hypocrite; and although they are aware of the denunciations of their
God, whom they acknowledge is a witness to all their actions, while they
preserve their fair fame they still persevere. In fact, they live as if
they disbelieved in his existence; and yet the greatest criminal, the
most depraved wretch, would shudder at being told there is no God. The
atheist, as a man, is liable to commit the same crimes, and fall into
the same vices as the believer; but because he is an atheist, is he a
worse criminal than the other? In one respect, I conceive he is not so
bad. He only acts in defiance of _human_ laws,--he only offends men; the
other infringes _both divine_ and _human_;--he defies both God and man.
Both are injurious to society and themselves, and both are actuated by
the came motives.

Again we are told, that the well disposed part of mankind are rendered
more virtuous, and the vicious less vicious by this doctrine. How are
we to know that? If the virtuous man acts uprightly, does good to his
fellow creatures, restrains his passions, and returns good for evil,
experience teaches him it is his interest so to do. Those who are
viciously disposed are only deterred from crime by penal laws. Societies
cannot long exist, where evil has the ascendency. Without social
laws, this would really be the case, notwithstanding the threats of an
avenging God. If men were told they would not be answerable for the evil
committed in this life to human laws, but that God would punish them
after death, it is evident the human race would soon be exterminated.
On the other hand, tell them their crimes will never be punished by God,
or, in other words, there is no other God than NATURE, but that the laws
of men will avenge the offences against society; so long as those
laws are administered with justice and impartiality, so long will such
society continue to improve. Hence it is evident that the system which
will maintain order in society by itself, must be the best and most
rational. A good government without religion would be more solid and
lasting, and tend more to the preservation of mankind, than all the
theocratical or ecclesiastical governments that ever the world was
subject to.--Thus much for the opponents of atheism.

It has been asserted with a perverse obstinacy, by the advocates for the
existence of a deity, that the SYSTEM OF NATURE was never written by
the author whose name it bears.--It is granted that it was not published
during his life: but that circumstance forms no reason why such a
conclusion should be drawn. The persecutions which the atheists have
endured, were a sufficient excuse for the work not appearing in any form
during the life time of its venerable author. The Athenians sought to
try Diagoras the Melian, for atheism; but he fled from Athens, and a
price was offered for his head. Protagoras was banished from Athens, and
his books burnt, because he ventured to assert, that he knew nothing of
the gods. Stephen Dolet was burnt at Paris for atheism. Giordano Bruno
was burnt by the Inquisitors in Italy. Lucilio Vanini was burnt at
Thoulouse, through the kind offices of an Attorney-General. Bayle
was under the necessity of fleeing to Holland. Casimio Liszynski was
executed at Grodno;--and Akenhead at Edinborough. And the body of the
eloquent and erudite Hume, was obliged to be watched many nights by his
friends, lest it should be taken up by the fanatics, who considered him
one of the greatest monsters of iniquity, because he did not happen to
believe as they believed.--With these pictures of Christian persecution
before his eyes, is it surprising that M. de Mirabaud should adopt the
resolution of suffering the SYSTEM OF NATURE to appear as a posthumous
work? That the same fate would have attended him, the most devout
Christian will not undertake to deny.

However the sentiments of M. de Mirabaud may be condemned by the
fanatics, all those who knew him bear the most brilliant testimony of
his integrity, candour, and the soundness of his understanding; in a
word, to his social virtues, and the innocence of his manners. He died
universally regretted, at Paris, the twenty-fourth of June, 1760, in the
eighty-sixth year of his age.

The following works, written by him at different periods, were never
published:--_The Life of Jesus Christ. Impartial Reflections on the
Gospel. The Morality of Nature. An Abridged History of the Priesthood;
Ancient and Modern. The Opinions of the Ancients concerning the Jews._ A
wretched mutilated edition of this last work was published at Amsterdam,
in 1740, in two small volumes, under the title of _Miscellaneous
Dissertations_.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
