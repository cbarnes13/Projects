three of them simply strained their eyes at the vast array of night
shadows in the heavens. But all that it got them was aching eyes.

"Nothing there evidently," Colonel Welsh eventually broke the silence.
"Perhaps it was just a falling star, but I never saw a star fall _up_."

"Maybe it was some of that Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said with a
chuckle. "I never heard of it being seen in this part of the country,
though."

"Saint _what_?" Freddy Farmer echoed. "What in the world are you
talking about? And what is it?"

"Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said. "Didn't you ever hear of it, Freddy?"

"Would I be asking, if I had?" the English youth snapped. "Go on. Stop
waiting to be encouraged to show all your knowledge. Just what is Saint
Elmo's Fire?"

"Well, I can't give you a scientific answer to that one," Dave said.

And of recent years it has been seen on the wing tips of airplanes
flying through electrically charged air. Frankly, I've never seen any
of the stuff in my life. But I knew a pilot once who used to fly over
the Andes in South America, and he said they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed aid they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed toew a pilot once who used to fly over
the Andes in South America, and he said they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed to roll right along the leading
edges of the wing, and then disappear just when you thought they were
going to bump into the gas tanks, or something. The first few times he
witnessed such a display he lost a dozen years off his life. He said,
though, that after a while he got used to it--even looked forward to
it every time he took off."

"You're pulling my leg!" Freddy snorted.

"No, Farmer, that's true," Colonel Welsh said. "I've seen some Saint
Elmo's Fire myself. And I can tell you that it scares the pants off you
the first time you see it. Ever fly through a thunder storm, and see
lightning playing around your wing tips?"

"Yes, I've seen that," Freddy admitted. "And I was sure I'd never live
to land safely on the ground again."

"Well, then, you know how it feels to see Saint Elmo's Fire," the
Colonel chuckled. "Only I think the Saint Elmo stuff gives you a worse
scare when you see it actually come rolling along the wing toward you.
But that light I saw just now wasn't shaped like a ball. More like a
streak, or like the powdered tail of a comet. It was strung out in a--"

If Colonel Welsh finished the sentence, nobody heard it. At that moment
the night skies shook and trembled with the savage yammer of aerial
machine gun fire. And the cabin window not eighteen inches in front of
Dave's eyes seemed to crack in a trillion places and then melt away
into oblivion.

"My word!" Colonel Welsh cried. "What was that?"

Dave didn't bother to answer for a second or so. His heart had zoomed
up his throat to jam hard against his back teeth, and his eyes had
bulged out of their sockets like marbles on sticks. Instinct took split
second charge of his movements, however, and almost before he realized
what he was doing he had booted the Lockheed up over on left wing tip
and was slicing down through the air. At practically the same instant
he whipped out his free hand and switched off the navigation lights.
Then as the craft went slicing down through the night sky, he dragged
air into his aching lungs.

"Those were aerial machine guns!" he cried. "And whoever was working
them was in earnest. Look at that window! Just a shade improvement on
his aim and it would have been curtains for the three of us."

As the last left Dave's lips, he pulled the plane out of its wild
sideslip and went curving up and around to the left.

"Aerial machine guns?" Colonel Welsh echoed in blank amazement. "You're
crazy, Dawson!"

"Could be, and maybe!" Dave snapped. "But I've heard those sky
choppers often enough to recognize them every time. And do you think an
eagle or something flew into that window, sir?"

"No, of course not," the Intelligence chief grunted. "Sorry I sounded
off. You're right, of course. But it doesn't make sense. Who the devil
would want to take a crack at us?"

Dave shrugged in the darkness, and for a moment or so as the plane
roared heavenward he strained his eyes for a glimpse of some other
shadow cutting about in the air. He saw nothing, however, and then
turned his head and spoke back over his shoulder.

"Maybe not _us_, sir," he said, "but I guess the Axis would be pretty
tickled to see _you_ put out of circulation. If you want my guess, some
rat saw you take off with us. Maybe he used a hidden radio and sent
word ahead. This mountainous country is a swell place to hide a plane,
you know, sir."

"And those _were_ exhaust plumes you saw!" Freddy Farmer cried. "The
lad was probably climbing up to get around in back when you saw his
exhaust plumes. Well, let the beggar come again. We'll--Good grief!
This plane isn't armed!"

"No," Colonel Welsh said in a slightly hollow voice. "Guess they never
figured it was necessary to arm these utility planes used to transport
personnel about the country."

"If only the chaps in high places would stop _figuring_ so much in this
war!" Dave groaned.

"Quite!" Freddy Farmer echoed the truth bitterly. "But bemoaning the
lack of common sense in the average High Command won't help us now. If
the blighter comes back for another fling, Dave, you'll just have to--"

"Don't bother telling me!" Dave shouted. "Here he comes--from the left
and up! Hang onto your seats!"

The last had hardly left Dave's lips before he was hauling the Lockheed
straight up on its tail. Before the plane reached stalling speed,
however, he kicked it over on wing and then sent it dropping nose first
toward the black carpet below that was the ground. No sooner had he
kicked the plane over on wing than he switched off both engines, and
shoved the compensator throttle open wide, so that no carbon sparks or
exhaust light of any kind would etch their path downward through the
night.

Meanwhile the mysterious attacker had opened fire again, but Dave's
quick action at the controls caused the unknown killer to miss by a
wide margin. The flickering ribbon of tracers didn't even come close.
And at the end of another three or four seconds the Lockheed was well
on its way earthward and out of sight.

"See that bird as he banged on by us?" Dave cried, when he was able to
talk again. "It looked to me like a small Beechcraft. Or maybe it was a
Waco. But he's carrying two guns--and he wants us mighty badly. Heck,
if there were only guns aboard this crate. I had a beautiful broadside
bead on him."

"Yes, I saw his silhouette as he tore by," Freddy said through clenched
teeth. "But I didn't recognize his type. I don't know the Yank planes
very well, though. But I say, Dave! Watch our altitude, you know!"

"You're telling me!" Dave grunted. "I'm watching it plenty, and
praying, too. There must be some of those mountains under us by now.
I think we've got a couple of thousand feet to play around in, but no
more than that. I'm flat gliding her as much as I can, but keep those
eagle X-ray eyes of yours on the job, Freddy. And yell if you see a
mountain peak looming up."

"Mountain peak!" Colonel Welsh cried excitedly. "For pity's sake, keep
above them, Dawson. Start those engines and get us some altitude!"

"That would be risking more than this glide, sir," Dave told him.
"That bird up there has been spotting us by our exhaust plumes, and
aiming blindly. So long as we show no light at all he stands to lose us
completely. But if we open up the engines and show exhaust light he's
going to be able to take another crack. And--well, third time never
fails, you know, and stuff. Our best bet is to try and lose him before
we get too low. He has a ship that can travel, but if we get a little
lead on him we'll be all right."

"But remember all those mountain peaks down there!" the Intelligence
chief persisted. "One thing this plane has got is parachutes. Perhaps
we'd better bail out and let the blasted ship crash. At least we'd save
our own necks."

"Not me!" Dave barked without thinking. "Go ahead and bail out if
you want to. You, too, Freddy. But I'm sticking with this ship if
I possibly can. I don't want to see her bust up, if I can help it.
Anyway, I'm going to give her all the breaks she's got coming."

"And of course I'm staying with you," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "I'm
a blasted fool to put my precious neck in your hands. But there you
are, anyway."

"No wonder you two are famous for pulling miracles out of a hat!"
Colonel Welsh growled. Then after a short pause: "Very well! If Farmer
trusts you that much, I suppose I might as well. But if you have to hit
a mountain, for pity's sake try and pick out a soft one. I bruise very
easily!"




CHAPTER SEVEN

_Pilot's Luck_


Dave chuckled as the Colonel's remark came to his ears, but his heart
pounded a little harder and the warm glow of pride rippled through his
veins.

"Thanks, sir," he said. "And sorry that I exploded that way. But don't
worry, I'll get us out of this little jam if it's the last thing I do."

"Well, see that it _isn't_, my good man!" Freddy Farmer grunted.

For the next few moments nobody said a word. All three of them leaned
forward in their seats and strained their eyes at the darkness ahead
and below. Dave's hands felt cold and clammy, and he could feel the
little drops of sweat ooze out on his forehead and trickle down his
face. For the last fifteen seconds or so he had spotted what he
believed to be a mountain peak just ahead, and not more than a hundred
feet below. He didn't say a word to the others. He kept his mouth shut
and eased the plane a little to the left so as to be able to pass on
by the peak with enough free air to spare between his right wing tip
and the unseen trees or jagged rocks he knew must dot all sides of
that peak. Once past it, he could start the engines again and climb
for altitude. It was a cinch that the unknown attacker was cutting
about in the black sky somewhere far behind him. But once he got beyond
that peak he felt that his lead would be great enough for him to risk
showing his exhaust plumes. As a matter of fact, though, it was quite
possible that the unknown attacker was miles and miles behind. It was
possible that the man had cut around to the east, believing that Dave
wouldn't dare chance holding his westerly course with the mountains so
close.

"Yeah, maybe!" he murmured. "But I'm going to make sure just the same!"

"What did you say, Dave?" Freddy Farmer cried out in a voice of alarm.

"I didn't say a thing," Dave grunted, and tightened his hold on the
controls. "Just thinking a little out loud. Shut up, little man, or
you'll make me rock the boat."

Freddy Farmer caught his breath as though he were about to speak.
Instead, though, he said nothing. He simply leaned farther forward
in his seat. Dave caught the movement out the corner of his eye,
and grinned, tight-lipped. Freddy had sighted the mountain peak, but
realized that he had seen it and was trying to slide by on the left. So
the English youth had snapped his lips shut so as not to give Colonel
Welsh a slight case of heart failure. Good old Freddy. Always knew when
to open his mouth, and when to keep mum.

Perhaps it was six seconds, but it seemed like six thousand years to
Dave before the slightly darker shadow that was the mountain peak slid
past the tip of the right wing and disappeared behind. The instant it
was gone from view he whipped on the switches, caught both engines,
and fed them high test gas at full throttle. The roar of the engines
breaking into life was a sound akin to worlds crashing into each other.
Yet at the same time it was a welcome sound to Dave's ears, and to
Freddy Farmer's too. But what filled their hearts with an even greater
happiness was the Lockheed climbing upward to a safe altitude above the
mountain range. The instant he was well clear, Dave swung the plane
onto its westerly course again, and relaxed in the seat.

"Top-hole, Dave," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "A very pukka bit of
flying, that."

"Thanks," Dave replied. "We got away with it okay. But I'd hate like
heck to have to do it every day. You spotted that mountain peak, didn't
you?"

"Quite," the English youth murmured. "But I thought it best to keep my
mouth shut. Realized that you knew what you were doing. And besides, no
sense in--"

"No sense in giving this old dodo grey hairs, eh?" Colonel Welsh spoke
up with a chuckle. "Well, it was nice of both of you, but I saw it,
too. The only reason _I_ didn't speak, though, was because my tongue
was frozen stiff. As you say, Dawson, I'd hate to have that sort of
thing for a daily diet. Very sweet flying, though, very sweet."

"We could have made it sweeter if this plane had been armed," Dave
grunted, and stared at the black sky ahead. "That tramp certainly had
his nerve jumping on us. Wonder who the heck he could be. Sure you
haven't any ideas, Colonel?"

There was a long minute of silence while the senior officer seemed to
make up his mind.

"No, I'm afraid I haven't," he finally said slowly. "As you mentioned
awhile back, there are probably plenty of birds who would like to see
me out of the way. Somehow, though, I can't see them going about it in
this manner. Their style is more along the line of pot shots from dark
doorways. Or a bomb in my car, or tossed through my window. Frankly, I
can't make head nor tail of this business tonight."

"Many chaps know you were headed west, sir?" Freddy Farmer asked
quietly.

"What do you mean, many?" the Colonel replied sharply. "Did I broadcast
it, you mean?"

"Hardly that, sir," Freddy chuckled. "I mean, did you tell many people
that you were making this trip? Not that any of them are in the pay
of Tokio or Berlin, sir, but it's possible that one of them might
innocently enough mention the fact to somebody who was. You understand
what I mean, sir?"

There was another moment of silence while the chief of U. S.
Intelligence thought things over.

"I see what you mean, Farmer," he grunted presently. "No, I didn't tell
anybody who didn't have the right to know. Fact is, the only ones I
told were those three officers you met in my office. And if those three
aren't one hundred per cent Americans, then I'm Adolf Hitler in the
flesh."

"What about the other end?" Dawson asked.

"What other end?"

"San Diego," Dave said. "Is your man in charge there expecting you? Or
are you just dropping in on a surprise visit?"

"No wonder you chaps always come out on top," Colonel Welsh said in a
frank tone. "Once you get your teeth in something you keep at it until
there's nothing left. Yes, I did wire my head agent in San Diego that I
was coming west tonight. And--"

"And my first month's pay as a U. S. Naval Aviation Lieutenant says
somebody read that wire!" Dawson cut in quickly.

"Hold it!" Colonel Welsh cried, and laughed shortly. "You're flying one
wing low this time. I said in the wire that I was coming out, but I
didn't say _how_, or _what_ time I'd arrive. Afraid you're off on the
wrong scent there, Dawson."

"Maybe, maybe not," Dave said doggedly. "But that chap didn't have a
crack at us tonight just for gunnery practice. He was shooting for
keeps. He knew darn well who was in this plane--and he was out to get
us. He--"

Dave didn't finish. At that moment the right outboard engine of the
Lockheed lost revs fast and began to sputter and clatter. Dave snapped
his eyes at the dash dials, and sucked in his breath sharply as he saw
the oil pressure needle sliding around the face of the dial toward
the zero peg. However, even as he glanced at the needle, it stopped
swinging back and promptly climbed upward again. The engine stopped
sputtering and clattering, and once again sang its full throated song
of power.

The tiny lump of ice remained in Dave's chest, however. He glanced
sidewise at Freddy Farmer and saw the corners of the English youth's
mouth tighten a bit.

"What the devil was that?" Colonel Welsh demanded in a sharp tone.
"Something wrong with the engine?"

"Not now," Dave said with an easiness he didn't feel. "Guess it picked
up a bit of ice but got rid of it in time. Anyway, she's back where
she should be. As I was saying, that lad tonight was out for blood. So
it must follow that somebody knew where you were going, when, and how.
Don't you think so, sir?"

Dave spoke the words, but it was really just an effort to keep the
conversation going. The lump of ice in his chest was hurting him
again, and he was feeling far from calm and collected. The way the
oil pressure of the right outboard engine had dropped told him that
there was trouble ahead. Many people claim that the carburetor is the
heart of an engine, and probably it is, if you want to look at it that
way. However, countless hours in the air had proved to Dave that your
real danger signal is when oil pressure starts dancing around. Engines
can run, often for a long, long time, when the carburetor is out of
whack and the engine is getting a bad feed. But let oil pressure go
screwy and you'll have real trouble on your hands. There are no halfway
measures about oil. It has to be right or your engine is worth no more
than its weight in junk. Gasoline is food for an engine, but oil is its
life blood. If it hasn't got the proper amount it dies, but definitely!

And so Dave spoke the words just to keep the conversation going and
fixed his eyes on the instruments pertaining to the functioning of the
right outboard engine. He hoped and prayed that the skipping had simply
been just one of those things. But in his heart there was gnawing
fear and dread. He feared that bullets from the guns of that unknown
attacker had nicked one of the oil feed lines, and that continued
vibration of the engine was slowly but surely shaking the feed line
connection loose, or at least causing it to crack and buckle slowly, so
that eventually the pressure set up in the line would be reduced to nil.

If it had been daylight, or if he had been sure of the terrain below,
he would have landed and made sure what had happened. But a landing was
too great a risk right now. His best bet was to keep going, nursing the
right outboard engine as much as he could, and hoping and praying that
it would continue to tick over and produce power.

"Yes, I guess your reasoning is sound enough," he heard the Colonel
say. "It's rather hard to believe, though. I mean, why go about it in
such a--well, in such a story book thriller style, you might say? I'm
not going to San Diego on any vital mission. Fact is, I could make this
trip tonight or next week, and it wouldn't make much difference. That's
what makes it seem so--so utterly crazy."

There was a moment of silence, and then Dave laughed a trifle
flat-toned.

"I don't mean to be conceited," he said. "But what you've just said,
sir, doesn't make me feel so good. Or maybe it should make me feel
important as heck. How about you, Freddy? Catch on?"

"I think so," the English youth replied. "But it's a bit--er,
fantastic, you know. However, I would feel a bit better if we had been
able to shoot the beggar down. Always did say night attacks weren't
quite the sporting thing, you know."

"Not the sporting thing, huh?" Dave echoed with a snort. "Pal, that's
only putting it by half. In my book they're plain murder."

"Of course, I'm only the passenger," Colonel Welsh spoke up sharply.
"So don't mind me. However, I would like very much to know what the
devil you two are jabbering about. What's it all about, anyway?"

"You tell him, Freddy," Dave said. "I--I feel too modest."

"Rubbish!" the English youth snapped. "You couldn't be if you tried.
Besides, you brought it up."

"Listen, you lads!" the chief of U. S. Intelligence boomed in
exasperation. "Have I got to use my authority as a Colonel? What in
blue blazes are you two talking about?"

"The fantastic, sir," Dave said with a chuckle. "Yet, on the other
hand, possibly the truth. Maybe the pilot of that plane didn't want
_Farmer and me to go aboard the Carrier Indian_."

Colonel Welsh made a hissing sound as he sucked in his breath sharply.

"Great guns!" he gasped. And then in the same breath: "But that _is_
impossible. Not even my three closest assistants knew that was to
happen until I informed you. And we went from my office straight to
Alexandria Field. No, you must be wrong, Dawson. Captains Lamb and
Stacey, and Lieutenant Caldwell, wouldn't breath a word of that even
though a gun were held at their hearts. That _is_ fantastic!"

The two boys looked crestfallen.

"See, Freddy?" Dave cried, and jabbed an elbow in his pal's ribs. "You
get the screwiest ideas. I never--!"

"None of that, funny boy!" the English youth barked back at him. "No,
you don't, not by a jugful. You brought it up. I simply agreed with
you, to be polite. You're quite right, Colonel. It's ridiculous. But
when you get to know Dawson better, you'll understand how he's--"

The rest of what Freddy Farmer would have said to the Colonel stuck
fast when only halfway up his throat. The right outboard engine
had started kicking up again, but this time it was really doing it
in earnest. The oil pressure needle went around to the zero peg in
a single jump. And even as Dave grabbed for the throttle, the right
outboard engine let out a grinding scream as though it were actually
something human, and in mortal pain. It had run dry and was seizing
up. Almost at the same instant, and as though in sympathy for its
mechanical brother, the left outboard engine started falling off in
revs at an alarming rate. Dave killed the right engine completely,
shoved hard on the left rudder to check the plane yawing, and
concentrated on keeping the left outboard engines alive as long as
possible.

"That tears it!" he said between clenched teeth. "I was afraid that
right engine had been nicked. Getting ready to drop a couple of those
landing flares, Freddy. At least we can take a look at what it's like
below."

"Take a look?" Colonel Welsh cried sharply. "You don't have to, boy!
There are mountains down there. Get us as high as you can, and then
we'll all bail out."

A hot wave of anger swept through Dawson, but he was able to choke the
words back in time. Instead he turned to Freddy Farmer and nodded.

"Let a couple go, Freddy," he said quietly. "We're only losing a foot
or two of altitude. We'll take a look _first_!"




CHAPTER EIGHT

_Nobody's Airport_


Freddy Farmer didn't bother acknowledging the request by word of mouth.
He simply nodded, and reached out his hand and jerked the little handle
that released landing flares fitted into the wing tips. There were a
few seconds more of silence; then a great silver-white light came into
being below, and spread swiftly outward toward the four points of the
compass.

Fighting the tendency of the Lockheed to yaw toward the dead engine
side, and struggling to keep the left outboard engine turning over,
Dave leaned over close to the shattered window and peered down into the
sea of silver-white light below. For a couple of seconds he couldn't
see anything but eye-dazzling light. Then as the flares dropped astern,
he was able to get a good look at the type of terrain below.

What he saw didn't exactly cause his chilled heart to warm up and loop
over with joy. True, they had safely crossed over the highest peaks of
that part of the mountain range. Below, though, were the tree-covered
foothills, cut by deep jagged stone sided ravines, and narrow plateau
formations of ground that would be hard for even a crow to alight on.

"It's no go, Dawson!" Colonel Welsh's voice suddenly broke the tingling
silence that had settled over the trio. "I know what's in your mind,
but our safest bet is for all three of us to jump. We've still got
three or four thousand feet of clearance. I think we should jump."

"I don't, not yet," Dave said bluntly, and raked the terrain below with
his eyes. "I think we should hang on a bit longer, and try to pick out
some spot big enough to slip into. This is wild country here, Colonel.
If we bail out we'll lose contact with each other, and all three of us
get lost. Let's look hard, first. I can keep her up a big longer. That
left outboard hasn't quit cold yet. And we're not losing altitude too
fast."

"All right," Colonel Welsh said grimly, and leaned forward the better
to study the flare-lighted ground below. "Confound that rat! I'd give a
lot to have his neck between my two hands right now!"

"I can think of things to do to him, myself," Dave grunted. Then, out
of the corner of his mouth: "Work those eagle eyes hard, Freddy. This
is where you should star. You always do see things first. Hurry up and
find Papa a place big enough to set us down in."

"Shut up and tend to your flying!" the English youth growled. "You
dropped our nose two feet while you were talking. Want to power dive
us in, or something? You--hold it, Dave! Bear right a bit. What's that
down there? It looks like--oh, blast it! They would, wouldn't they!"

The last was caused by the two flares finally touching ground and being
snuffed out. Quick as a flash Freddy Farmer shot out his hand and
released two more flares. The instant his eyes were again accustomed
to the bright light, Dave looked in the direction of the English
youth's pointed finger. His heart did loop with joy this time, and
he gulped with relief. What at first looked like the rock studded
side of a foothill was actually a strip of barren and seemingly level
ground between two foothills. It wasn't very big, but it seemed big
enough--unless Lady Luck deliberately turned her face the other way.

"Yeah, check, Freddy!" Dave murmured, and eased the laboring Lockheed
around and down. "That's us, that spot. Just hang on, everybody. It
won't be long now!"

"I don't like the way you say that!" Colonel Welsh said with a
mirthless laugh. "But I guess you don't mean it. Go ahead, though. I
was wrong again. We'll keep the parachutes in their packs. What a fine
night this has turned out to be!"

"Me, I'm thinking of tomorrow and next week," Dave muttered grimly as
he eased the Lockheed lower and lower, and around toward the near end
of the narrow landing space. "This is wild country here. It's plenty
wild. Right in the middle of nowhere. And this baby isn't going to do
any more flying until she has a couple of new engines stuck in her. Oh
well--"

Dave let the rest go with a shrug and hunched forward slightly over the
controls. The time for talking had passed. Now was the time for action,
and prayer. The Lockheed was down low now, too low to correct any
mistakes. The first swipe at that narrow landing space had to be good.
It had to be perfect. The jagged rocks and trees on all four sides
would make a second try impossible.

Dave's whole body felt dry as a chip, yet at the same time sweat poured
off his forehead, and the palms of his hands were clammy and cold. He
could almost feel Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh hold their breath.
As far as that went, he could almost feel the whole world stand still
and hold its breath. The dropped flares were throwing off less and less
light, but he refrained from telling Freddy to drop a couple of new
ones. Their first moment of brilliance might blind him just enough to
misjudge things by a hair. And misjudging by a hair would be more than
enough to pile them up in a heap among the trees and jagged rocks.

"Now!" he whispered softly. "Now, baby! Easy does it, now. Down you go.
Down you go. Ah-h-h...! That's the stuff!"

The Lockheed's wheels touched, touched hard, and the plane tried to
push itself off and up into the air again. But Dave had killed the
forward speed as much as he could. And after a short run forward,
and gentle but firm application of the wheel brakes by Dawson, the
twin-engined craft finally bumped to a halt not ten feet from the lip
of a sharp drop-off in the ground.

"Now I've seen everything!" Colonel Welsh fairly exploded the words.
"I've seen two miracles come to pass in the same night. It couldn't
be done, but you did it, Dawson. Congratulations from the bottom of my
heart. Good work! We really are on the ground, aren't we?"

Dave didn't bother to answer. As a matter of fact he couldn't have
said a single word at that moment even though it would have gained him
a million dollars. His heart was stuck halfway between his chest and
his throat, and refused to go up or down. It was the same with Freddy
Farmer, too. The English youth sat stiff and straight in his seat,
working his lips but making no sound. Eventually, though, he did manage
to get control of his tongue and of his frozen muscles. He reached
across and pressed Dave's arm.

"Top-hole, Dave!" he got out in a husky voice. "A bit of the very, very
best, and I mean it, really. As a pilot bloke myself, I know how good
you have to be to get away with that sort of thing. It was absolutely
perfect."

"What else?" Dave cracked back with a shaky laugh. "Look who did it!
But skip it. Is my hair grey, Freddy? Do I look very much older? I know
doggone well I gained forty years in those last couple of seconds.
Jeepers! Take a look at that drop-off ahead. Another ten feet and you
_wouldn't_ be thinking I was so hot. And I'm not, really. If Lady Luck
ever landed a plane, she did it that time, and I'm not kidding."

"Well, we're down, anyway," said Freddy. Then, getting practical: "What
do we do now? Do you know this area very well, sir? Have we got far to
go to the next village?"

Both Dave and the Colonel laughed in spite of the seriousness of the
situation. And Freddy made angry sounds in his throat.

"What's so blasted funny about that?" he demanded. "Do you plan to stay
here all night?"

"Sorry, Freddy," Dave said, and patted his pal's knee. "But this isn't
England, where you can throw a rock from one town and have it land in
the next one. This is our wild and woolly west. I don't know exactly
where we are, but I'd make a rough guess that we're a good two hundred
miles from the nearest town. And that's as the crow flies. Going over
and down these mountains and hills, you could add another two hundred
miles. What do you think, Colonel?"

"Well, not quite that far, Dawson," the senior officer said with a
laugh that was just a little too tight. "You're stretching it a little,
I'd say. Call it a hundred by air and two-fifty by foot, I guess.
We're just over the Arizona line and south of Holbrook. I'm afraid,
though, Farmer, that we will have to sit here for the rest of the
night, worse luck. To try and get out of here in the dark is just about
like deciding to step off some cliff and smash yourself to bits on the
bottom of a ravine. No. We've got to sit here until they find us."

"Hey!" Dave cried. "Aren't you forgetting something, Colonel? I mean,
who knows we're on our way? We--Oh, I see! You planned to send word
back to your office, eh? When they don't hear, they'll send planes
hunting for us, huh?"

The Colonel groaned heavily and clapped a hand to his forehead.

"You spoiled it that time, Dawson!" he muttered. "But you hit the
nail on the head. I did forget. I mean, I didn't say anything about
letting Lamb or Stacey know when I arrived at San Diego. They simply
expect to hear from me, when they hear. And my man at San Diego doesn't
actually know when I expect to arrive. This _is_ a sweet mess. I should
be demoted and kicked back into the ranks for not thinking of this
possibility. We're stuck, and no two ways about it."

"But we took this plane from the Alexandria Field," Dave said. "What
about their flight board there? Don't they list every take-off, the
pilot, and where he's heading?"

"Usually, but not in a case like this," the Colonel replied unhappily.
"When I borrow a plane, I don't tell them where I'm going. And
naturally, they don't ask me. But do we have to sit here in this
darkness, Dawson? The lights don't run off the engine, do they? How
about some light, eh?"

"Sure, sir," Dave said, and flipped up a couple of switches.

The interior of the compartment glowed with light, and the three looked
at each other. They grinned in a friendly sort of way, but neither of
them was particularly happy looking. Freddy Farmer twisted around in
his seat and looked at the Colonel.

"Then we might be here for some time, sir?" he asked.

"For several hours, at least, Farmer," the senior officer replied
gravely. "Nothing to worry about, though. As soon as it's light, we'll
build a fire and get a smoke signal in the air. A passing transport
plane may see it and come down to investigate. We're a bit south of
their regular run, though. Still, one of them may see it and get some
rescue parties sent out. Nothing to worry about."

"Not even your constant worry, pal," Dave laughed, and stuck a hand in
his tunic pocket. "Your constant worry about starving, I mean. Here's a
flock of chocolate bars I picked up at Alexandria Field before we left.
One thing I didn't tell you about Farmer, Colonel. If he can't eat
forty times a day he gets as weak as a kitten. And where he puts it,
I'll never know. Doesn't weigh more than a hundred and fifty soaking
wet. He's--"

"Some other time, my funny little man!" Freddy cut in harshly. "I
wasn't thinking about eating, if you must know the truth. Something
more serious. Or at least it will be serious if we're stuck here for a
considerable length of time."

Dave's smile faded immediately. He stared at the English youth. Colonel
Welsh also regarded him keenly.

"Okay, what?" Dave finally asked.

"The Carrier Indian," Freddy replied. Then, looking at the Colonel,
he asked, "Didn't you say that she weighs anchor sometime tomorrow
afternoon--this afternoon, really? If we're stuck here, will she sail
without us? Or has her skipper orders to wait for word from you?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence swallowed hard and made a wry face.

"That close-shave landing!" he muttered savagely. "It still has my
brains all scrambled up. You're quite right, Farmer. What you say makes
it more of a mess than ever. The Indian is to sail whether her skipper
hears from me or not. Those two men of mine serving as machinists'
mates are already aboard. At least they were to go aboard last evening.
But she won't wait for you two. The skipper has his sailing orders, and
he'll sail whether he's shy two pilot lieutenants or not. Blast and
double blast it all! What you say, Farmer, gives me a very disquieting
thought. Perhaps I _wasn't_ the one that unknown killer was interested
in. It's quite possible that it _was_ you two. The attempt was made
to stop you from reaching the Indian before she sailed. Confound it!
If I've fumbled this thing all up, I'll go out somewhere and cut my
throat. But--but I still can't see how anybody else could possibly have
found out about this flight, let alone the real reason!"

Dave didn't say anything, but he was thinking of a case he had heard
about in England not so long ago. A bad leak had been found in the Air
Ministry Intelligence, and when it was eventually tracked to its source
it was discovered that a high official's own secretary--a supposedly
loyal Englishman who had held his post since long before the outbreak
of war--was actually in the pay of the Nazis.

"I'm wondering something, myself," he said presently. "Not to toss more
cold water on things, Colonel, but--well, you don't know for sure if
your two men went aboard the Indian last evening, do you?"

"No, not for sure," the senior officer replied with a shake of his
head. "But it's--Oh, I see what you mean. Maybe they were--er--delayed,
too, eh? You think of the nicest things, Dawson! But keep on thinking.
Don't stop. Maybe you'll think of a way to get us out of this jam in a
hurry."

"I sure wish I could!" Dave said fervently. Then, reaching out and
taking a flashlight from the instrument panel clamps, he said,
"Meantime I'm going to have a look at the engines. I could be wrong
about an oil line being nicked. It wouldn't be the first time. Maybe
it's something that we can patch up with some gum and a piece of our
shirts, and we can get ourselves out of here come daylight. That's a
hope, anyway."

Half an hour later, though, it wasn't a hope. The oil feed lines of the
right outboard engine were split and parted in three different spots.
Besides that, she was seized up tighter than a drum, and couldn't be
made to move short of using dynamite. The left outboard engine wasn't
in a much better condition. Bullets from the unknown attacker's guns
had started a bad leak in the gas line that couldn't be repaired
without the proper tools. And so at the end of the half hour Dave wiped
oil and grease from his hands and climbed down off the wing onto the
ground where Freddy Farmer and the chief of Intelligence waited.

"No soap," he said bitterly. "If that bird's job was to delay us, he
did it up brown. The only way you'll get this plane out of here is to
fly in a couple of new engines. Nothing to do but wait for daylight."

"Why wait?" Freddy Farmer protested. "Let's get a fire going now. No
telling but what it might be seen by somebody. It--I say, though! What
about your Indians? They'd give us a bit of trouble, wouldn't they?
I've heard--"

"Hold everything, pal!" Dave chuckled, while Colonel Welsh struggled
to keep a straight face. "Nowadays you only find that kind of Indians
in books, or in the movies. Let's get the fire started. It's a good
idea. And if Indians do show up I'll welcome them as the flowers in
May."

Freddy Farmer hesitated and looked hard at Dawson. After a moment or so
he shrugged.

"Very well, then," he murmured. "But I swear I don't know when to
believe you, and when not to. If I get scalped--"

"You won't!" Dave stopped him, and backed away. "Head's too hard!"

Freddy took a quick half step forward, but gave it up. Then the three
of them started collecting deadwood, and stuff from the plane that
could be used to make a good fire.




CHAPTER NINE

_Rescue Wings_


Dawn came roaring up over the mountains to the east to touch off
their peaks with fire, and send rainbows of color arcing off in all
directions. It was a sight to make a man catch his breath and stand in
awe of the glorious majesty of nature. But for Dave Dawson and Freddy
Farmer and Colonel Welsh, the coming of the new day was more than just
something beautiful to watch and admire. It was like being released
from a prison of darkness.

As soon as there was enough light to allow vision at any great
distance, they eagerly and hopefully scrutinized their immediate
surroundings. But what they saw dashed their hopes even lower.
Heart-chilling wilderness met their gaze on all sides. It was as though
they had landed at the very end of the world; landed in a little pocket
of level ground completely lost in the depths of jagged rock sided
hills and towering snow-capped mountains.

For several minutes they looked about them in silence. Then, as though
at an unspoken signal, they turned and looked at each other, each man
reading the message of utter helplessness reflected in the next man's
eyes. It was Dave who finally broke the silence, and spoke the thought
that was in the minds of the other two.

"Our smoke signal won't be seen by any plane unless it passes directly
over this spot," he said. "These hills and mountains are such that
it's as if we were at the bottom of a well. And it's going to be even
tougher getting out of here on foot."

Neither Freddy Farmer or Colonel Welsh said anything. There wasn't
anything they could say. Dave had spoken the truth. And that was that.
Eventually Colonel Welsh knocked the ashes from his dead pipe and stuck
it back in his pocket.

"We'd better not try going out on foot for a while," he said, "at least
not until tomorrow. Better to stick here today and see if anything
happens. I'm mighty sorry this happened, you fellows. It's all my
fault, and I could kick myself right up the side of that mountain."

"I wouldn't say that, sir," Freddy Farmer said with a smile. "You had
no idea that chap was going to attack us last night."

"No," the chief of U. S. Intelligence growled. "Just the same,
ignorance is no excuse. I should have made sure, just in case the
unexpected did happen. I certainly should have taken a plane fitted
with a radio, instead of this one that hasn't got any. At least we
could have let the world know that we were going down for a forced
landing. But as it turned out--"

The Colonel sighed heavily and let the rest slide. Dave and Freddy
looked at each other and shrugged. It was no use crying over spilled
milk, but as a matter of cold hard fact both of them had been just
a little surprised when they had boarded the plane and seen that it
carried no radio. Neither, though, had said anything about it.

"Why wasn't it fitted with a radio, sir?" Dave finally blurted out the
question. "I mean--well, a radio is standard equipment on any ship. Is
there no radio on this for some particular reason?"

"Yes," the senior officer replied with a wry smile, and tapped his
chest. "I'm the reason. On a couple of occasions when the plane I
was in did have a radio, I was contacted about this and that every
half hour or so. Once I even turned back because of a message I had
received, only to find I'd wasted my time. Ever since then I've flown
without a radio. Been able to get more done, too. But I certainly
struck out this time. I'm sorry."

"Well, those things happen," Dave said politely, and let the subject
drop. "How about a short scouting trip about here? Or better yet, what
say I to make the top of that mountain, there? I guess I could do it in
a couple of hours. Maybe we're not buried as deep as we think we are.
Maybe I'll see a town, or a Ranger camp from there. Also, I may find
some berries and stuff, and a spring. The chocolate we have aboard, and
the drinking water, isn't going to last us for very long. What do you
think, Colonel? Think you can keep Freddy cheered up while I'm gone?
See that the Indians don't get him?"

The Colonel grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but what he was
about to say never left his lips. At that moment all three of them
heard the faint drone of a plane somewhere up in the sky, but out of
sight behind the towering mountains north of them. As one man they spun
around and stared hard at the dawn light bouncing off the snow-capped
peaks. Nobody said a word. Nobody could. They were all too busy
holding their breath, and praying as they had never prayed before.

After a few seconds Dave snapped out of his trance, ran over to the
pile of deadwood they had collected, grabbed up an armful, ran back to
the fire and dumped his load. Then he picked up a can of oil drained
from the engine and poured it on the licking flames. A second more and
a column of oily black smoke went towering up into the dawn sky.

"He can't miss that, unless he's blind!" Dave muttered through clenched
teeth as the black smoke mounted higher and higher. "Come on, whoever
you are, take a look, take a look!"

"Steady, Dawson," Colonel Welsh cautioned gently as Dave's voice rose
to a wild shout. "We've got to steel ourselves in case he doesn't see
it. Then it won't be so tough. This thing might happen several times,
you know. No telling. Save your strength, son. Take it easy."

Dave hardly heard the words of wisdom. His eyes were glued to the
north, his ears strained to catch every beat of the plane's engine
which was still out of sight, and his two fists clenched tight as
though he were actually pulling the unseen plane closer and closer.
Then, suddenly, the drone of the engine grew louder. It rose to a
mighty roar. And then the plane came sailing into view above the
mountain peaks. It was a five-place Stinson cabin plane, a commercial
plane probably owned by some rancher. There were no markings on the
craft other than the usual Bureau of Aeronautics license letter and
number. A wild cry of joyous relief struggled up Dave's throat but was
unable to pass his lips. A riot of emotions boiled up within him, and
his lips and his tongue were suddenly too dry to form sounds. So he
simply stood stock still and grinned from ear to ear as the cabin plane
cleared the peak and then came nosing down toward them; circling down
like some giant bird seeking a spot to light on.

When it was less than five hundred feet over their heads, the three men
shook themselves loose from their paralytic spell and started jumping
around and waving their arms wildly as though the pilot of the plane
hadn't seen them yet. The pilot waggled his wings as a signal that he
had, and then leveled off and went coasting toward the eastern end
of the landing strip. There he circled back, suddenly fed hop to his
engine and started to climb. For one horrible moment Dave was afraid
the pilot had decided that he couldn't put his plane down on the small
strip. But he was wrong. The pilot had simply goosed his engine to add
enough to his speed to clear the tops of some tall trees. He slipped
over them, went up on left wing a bit, and slid down to level off in a
perfect landing.

Even as the plane was braking to a stop, Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel
rushed back to it. They pulled up to a halt, waited for the plane to
roll the last few feet, then ducked under the left wing and around to
the cabin door. They had already seen that there were two men aboard
the plane, the pilot and a passenger. As Dave watched them come back
from the pilot's nook to the cabin door, he was faintly surprised by
their looks. Why, he didn't know, but somehow he had expected to see
a couple of youngsters climb down from the plane. But they weren't
young. They were both well along in years. They had hard, rugged faces,
covered by at least a two week's growth of whiskers. They wore rough
clothing, and each man carried a gun slung at his hip. The guns were
not pistols, though. They were automatics, and Dave suddenly had the
hunch that their rescuers were a couple of fire rangers, or at least
some kind of government men. The way they leaped cat-like out the cabin
door and down onto the ground seemed somehow to suggest the military
to Dave. But what they were didn't matter in the slightest. They had
arrived to rescue them, and that was all that counted.

"Stuck, huh?" the older one of the pair grunted, and grinned. "Lucky we
happened to see your smoke signal. You might have camped here for quite
a spell. Army and Navy, huh?"

"And in a hurry," Colonel Welsh said. Then, after introducing himself:
"We had a forced landing. Er--engine trouble. Can you fly us to the
nearest Air Corps Base where we can pick up another plane? I'll see
that you're paid for it, of course."

"Guess so," the man grunted after a look at his partner. "But where're
you headed? Maybe we could hop you all the way, and save time, if
you're in such a hurry."

"San Diego," Colonel Welsh said. "I have to get there as soon as
possible. But maybe you haven't the gas."

"San Diego, huh?" the older one, who was the pilot, murmured, and
arched his brows. "Yeah. I guess we can make it there from here. Had
engine trouble, huh? Not much fun in this neck of the woods. Okay. Get
aboard."

A hidden thought was tugging at Dave's brain, but he couldn't seem to
get it out in the open. Something was just a wee bit wrong with the
picture, but after a moment of deep thought he decided it was worry
about a take-off from the narrow space of level ground.

"Think you've got a long enough run?" he asked, and jerked a thumb at
the crippled Lockheed. "Maybe the five of us should haul that out of
the way. But even then you wouldn't have much extra. There's a sharp
drop-off just ahead of it."

"Don't get in a sweat, kid," the man mouthed, and gave him a hard
stare. "I wouldn't have come down if I'd thought I couldn't get off
again. Just get aboard and keep your seat. We'll get you places, and
with no trouble at all. Okay, Colonel, let's get going."

With a curt nod the pilot and his passenger turned and climbed back
into the plane. Colonel Welsh followed at their heels, but for an
instant Dave and Freddy hung back. They looked at each other and
frowned slightly.

"Queer couple of blokes, aren't they?" the English youth murmured.
"Can't say I like their looks much."

"I've seen better," Dave replied with a nod. "But so long as they
get us out of here, I don't care what they look like. But--is there
something on your mind?"

"Not a thing," Freddy replied. Then, with a puzzled scowl: "Just sort
of feel funny, though. One of your confounded hunches, I guess. Oh
well! No doubt it's your American climate. I'm sure I should have
stayed in England."

"Hop in, or do you two kids want to stay and play boy scout?"

The Stinson's passenger stood framed in the cabin doorway. His blue
green eyes stabbed down at Dave and Freddy, and the mop of coarse red
hair on his head actually did look like fire in the glow of the dawn
sun. Dave stared at him, felt that elusive thought tug at his brain for
the last time, and then climbed into the plane with Freddy right behind.

The pilot at the controls glanced back just long enough to see that
everybody was aboard, and then he goosed the engine and taxied around
on one wheel, and went trundling back toward the far end of the landing
strip. His friend, the redhead, sat in the co-pilot's seat, but he was
twisted around so that he faced Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel, who
were sitting in the three passenger seats. A grin parted his lips, but
he seemed to be grinning over their heads rather than at them.

For a brief instant a clammy chill rippled through Dave. He shook it
off, angrily told himself that he was letting his imagination run wild,
and concentrated on watching the pilot take the plane off. It was a
beautiful bit of flying, and Dave nodded his head in silent approval
and admiration as the pilot held the Stinson on the ground until he had
plenty of forward speed, then gently eased it off and up as nice as
could be.

Holding the nose up, the pilot circled the Stinson upwards until the
mountain peaks were almost on a level with the wings. Flattening off
the climb, he banked around for the last time and went roaring between
two mountain peaks to the north. For a couple of minutes Dave was too
thrilled by the wild, heart stopping beauty of the mountain scenery
below to pay much attention to the course of the plane. Eventually,
though, when the sun continued to stay on the right wing side, he
stopped gaping at the terrain below, and glanced sharply ahead. The
redhead was still grinning, very comfortably relaxed in his seat. And
the pilot was still holding the nose pointed north as though he planned
to keep going in that direction for quite some time to come.

Dave held his peace for a moment or so longer. Then curiosity and an
eerie tingling sensation at the back of his neck forced the words off
his lips.

"We're heading north!" he called out. "San Diego isn't north of us!"

Both Colonel Welsh and Freddy Farmer jumped as though they had been
shot. They turned and stared at him, wide-eyed. The redhead stared at
him, too. But his eyes were slightly narrowed, and his perpetual grin
stiffened slightly. He didn't say anything.

"Well, what is the idea, anyway?" Colonel Welsh finally boomed angrily.
"San Diego is west and south of here!"

The redhead shrugged and nodded, but the pilot didn't even turn his
head.

"That's right, isn't it?" he called out. "Well, what do you know about
that? I guess we ain't heading for San Diego, Colonel. Kind of looks
that way, don't it, huh?"

Colonel Welsh blinked and looked blank for a moment. Then his face
reddened and he started up out of his seat.

"See here!" he thundered. "What in--?"

The redhead made a quick motion, and the chief of U. S. Intelligence
choked off the rest. But it was the automatic that suddenly seemed to
jump right into the redhead's hand that really stopped him. He froze
motionless half up out of his seat. The redhead waved the gun a little.

"Relax, and sit, Colonel!" he said in a voice that sounded like small
stones on a tin roof. "I couldn't let you have it down there, but up
here it's easy. Relax and get smart. And that goes for you two kids,
too!"




CHAPTER TEN

_Vulture's Nest_


For a long minute there was no sound inside the cabin save the faint
drone of the plane's engine. Like three men suddenly struck dumb, Dave,
Freddy, and the Colonel stared at the redhead. Rather, they stared at
the automatic he held in his right hand; held so that at the bat of
an eyelash he could send a bullet into either of them, or into all
three of them, for that matter. Then, finally, Colonel Welsh broke the
silence.

"What in thunder _is_ this?" he demanded. "Who are you two? What's the
idea?"

The redhead hunched his shoulders and half nodded his head toward the
pilot.

"That's Ike, and I'm Mike," he said with a chuckle. "But it isn't any
act. We're just keeping you on ice for a while, Colonel. Be nice and
you'll get back into circulation again in time. Be dumb, and you'll be
dead."

As the Colonel struggled for words, Dave leaned forward a little, arms
resting on his knees.

"This isn't the plane you flew last night," he said.

The redhead grinned all the more and shook his head.

"Nope," he said. "And that makes you a bright little boy--Flight
Lieutenant Dawson. And that was nice flying last night. I thought that
second time I had you cold. I guess you're as good at the controls as
I've heard tell you were. Or was this English kid, Farmer, doing the
flying?"

Dave didn't reply. He suddenly felt as though his seat had been
jerked out from under him, and as if his brain were tumbling down
through space. This redhead knew his name, and Freddy's, too? An eerie
chill swept through him, and he impulsively looked at Colonel Welsh.
The chief of U. S. Intelligence's face was bright with dumfounded
amazement. He in turn was staring speechlessly at the redhead. The man
with the gun dragged down a corner of his mouth in a scornful gesture.

"Why so surprised, Colonel?" he asked. "Did you think you were the only
smart one in this war?"

"You won't feel so smart when you're facing a firing squad!" the
Colonel clipped out. "And that's where you're headed. Both of you!"

"Well, what do you know!" the pilot cried out, and turned around just
long enough to give the Colonel a horse laugh. "Maybe you ain't got it
yet, Colonel, who's holding the gun. Snap out of it. I know it's tough,
but there's nothing you can do about it. Don't be a sap and make us let
you have it. We just want to keep you on ice for a while. That's all."

The Colonel seemed to swallow his wrath, because when he spoke again
his voice was normal, and almost friendly.

"All right, we'll be smart," he said. "But where are we heading? And
why are you keeping us on ice, as you call it? What good is it going to
do you?"

"What good?" the redhead echoed with a laugh. "Well, about ten thousand
dollars' worth, for one thing. For another--well, I guess we just don't
like you."

A hard, glittering look leaped into the Colonel's eyes, and Dave could
tell that the man was employing every ounce of his will power to stop
from leaping from his seat and hurling himself at the redhead, gun or
no gun.

"A couple of bought and paid for American traitors, eh?" the chief of
U. S. Intelligence suddenly grated. "American by birth only. Actually
lower than the rats in Berlin and Tokio are--the ones who are paying
you your blood money. Well, paste this in your hats. You'll never live
to spend that money. And that's a promise!"

The redhead simply continued to grin. Then suddenly the gun in his hand
spat flame and sound, and Dave saw the Colonel's left shoulder strap
fly off as though cut by a knife. The bullet tore on out through the
side of the cabin. Colonel Welsh didn't so much as flinch, or even bat
an eye. He held the redhead with a steady agate-eyed stare.

"Put the next right between my eyes!" he grated. "You'll still not
be able to spend that blood money. You'll be run to earth like the
anti-American vermin you are. And you'll be wiped out, along with the
rest of your fifth column brood."

The redhead didn't say anything. Dave wasn't sure, but he thought he
saw a look of fear flash across the man's unshaven face. However, it
came and went in a flash. The pilot turned from his controls again, and
gave the Colonel a long look.

"Maybe!" he finally said harshly. "That's the chance we take. But let's
not kid each other, Colonel. The point is that the Carrier Indian won't
be sailing with these two little heroes of yours aboard. Yeah! So don't
look like you're going to faint. We know all about it. The boys we work
for are smart. And your whole country is going to find that out in
short order, too.

"You guys in Washington have got a New Deal. Well, another guy has a
_New Deal_, too. I like his better. So don't waste breath trying to
unsell me. It can't be done. I've been kicked around too much by your
cops and F.B.I.

"I'm looking out for my own good, see? I found out how my pal and me
can make dough easy, and we're making it. No more working my life away
for nothing. I'm sold on _my_ New Deal.

"Now shut up, and relax. My pal and me have dough to earn."

"Aw, let 'em talk!" the redhead said with a hoarse laugh. "Maybe
they'll try selling us some of them Defense Bonds."

"And you shut up, too!" the pilot snarled. "I don't feel like hearing
anybody talk, see?"

The redhead looked both surprised and angry.

"Okay, okay!" he said. "So nobody talks."

Silence once more settled over the interior of the cabin, but it was
the kind of a silence that feels charged with high voltage electricity,
and apt to strike all over the place at an instant's notice. Turning
his head, Dave snapped a quick glance out the window, but what he saw
didn't help his spirits any. The plane was grinding northward over wild
mountainous country that looked every bit as uninviting as that narrow
strip of ground where they had force landed. Whether or not they had
reached the Utah line, or were still in Arizona, Dave couldn't tell
with that one quick glance. And he didn't bother taking a second look.

Fact was, it didn't matter where they were. Through a crazy twist of
fate they were helpless prisoners in the hands of two men who would
shoot them dead at the slightest provocation. The single warning shot
that the redhead had snapped across Colonel Welsh's shoulder had been
proof enough that he wasn't afraid to use his gun.

Yes, they were helpless prisoners. And their captors knew all about
them: who they were, where they had been heading, and why. As those
three truths came home to Dave, again he swallowed hard and shivered
slightly. It was like a crazy nightmare, only it wasn't. It was stark
reality; nothing out of a story book. The pilot and his redheaded
companion had received orders to make sure that Freddy Farmer and he
did not sail on the Aircraft Carrier Indian. They had tried the first
time last night by attacking them with machine guns in a plane.

They had failed, yet in a way they had succeeded. They had drilled the
Lockheed's engines and forced Dave to sit down on that narrow strip
of smooth ground deep in a valley. Not knowing the exact results of
their efforts, the two men had cruised about over the area as soon as
it became light, and--by another crazy twist of fate--they had seen
the smoke signal that had been sent up to attract _help_. Seeing that
the plane had not crashed, the two men had done the logical thing,
from their point of view. They had landed and picked up their prey.
Kidnapped them, yes, but for a very good reason. Some other plane
passing over might have landed and given them a quick lift to their
destination. So the redhead and the pilot had picked them up to make
sure somebody else wouldn't do it.

And the reason they hadn't been killed on the spot was simple to
figure. Death in the dark during that air attack last night would
have been different. The plane would have crashed and burned up, and
when its charred ruins were found no one would ever had dreamed that
bullets had sent it hurtling down to its doom. But three dead men lying
beside a force landed plane was something else again. A scene like
that naturally screamed murder all over the place. And so the redhead
and his pilot had kidnapped them so that if another plane landed to
investigate, it would look as though the occupants of the Lockheed had
tried to find their way back to civilization on foot, and had become
hopelessly lost in the mountains.

"But they know all about us! How?"

Dave didn't speak the words aloud. He spoke them only in his brain,
but as he glanced at Colonel Welsh and met the man's eyes he knew that
the senior officer understood what was in his mind, just as though he
had heard the words spoken. Even as Dave met his eyes, Colonel Welsh
bit his lower lip and gave a sharp little puzzled shake of his head. A
hundred and one answers to the question leaped into Dave's brain, but
every one of them seemed too fantastic even to bother considering.

However, fantastic or not, one thought kept hammering away until he was
forced to admit that it at least must be true. It was that somebody
close to Colonel Welsh--very close--was unquestionably in the pay of
Berlin, or Tokio. Somebody in the drab, unpretentious building where
Colonel Welsh maintained his real head-quarters was a traitor to the
American flag, a paid rat of the lowest form who gnawed at the very
heart of America.

But who? Dave thought of Captain Lamb, and Captain Stacey, and
Lieutenant Caldwell--and shook his head vigorously. He thought of the
man who had taken them up in the elevator--and wondered. He thought
of the man reading the book in that room with the mops and pails--and
wondered some more. In fact, he wondered until his head ached and his
brain rang. It just didn't seem possible that any spy could get close
enough to learn all that somebody had learned. That, however, was one
of the many cockeyed things about war. The impossible was constantly
popping up to prove to be a cinch. There were over two years of proof
of that. Poland for one. The Maginot Line for another. And Crete, and
Malaya, and Singapore--and Pearl Harbor, too, for that matter. All that
had happened at those various places just couldn't happen. Only it
_had_!

"So maybe Lamb, or Stacey, or--"

Dave cut short the unspoken thought. The pilot up forward had throttled
his engine and was nosing the Stinson downward. Leaning over close
to the window, Dave peered down and ahead. He saw a stretch of wild
wasteland that seemed to extend to the four horizons. Scrub growth,
a few patches of towering trees, and all the rocks in the world, it
seemed, met his scrutiny. The plane seemed to be nosing down toward an
area of tableland. And as Dave squinted his eyes he suddenly was able
to make out a couple of weatherbeaten shacks built close to a patch of
woods. He thought he saw something glistening just under the branches
of the trees, but he was too high and too far away to tell what it was.

"Okay!" the redhead suddenly called out. "We're getting near the end
of the line. Remember what I told you, you three. Be nice and nothing
will happen. Get funny and I'll drill you and think nothing of it, so
help me. I ain't a killer often, but when I am, I'm good. So watch your
step."




CHAPTER ELEVEN

_A Little Bit Of England!_


Dave didn't bother looking at the redhead as the man pushed words off
the tip of his tongue. He kept his nose pressed against the cabin
window and watched with beating heart as the area of tableland came
sweeping up closer and closer to the plane. The nearer the plane got to
the ground, the more weatherbeaten and deserted the two shacks looked.
In fact, Dave knew that if he should be flying over them at even a
thousand feet or so, he would instantly take them for a couple of
prospectors' shacks abandoned to the wind and the rain years and years
before.

Another couple of minutes and the Stinson went up on wing, cut around
in a dime turn, and then leveled off and settled to earth between two
rows of sun-bleached rocks. Hardly had the plane braked to a halt than
the redhead was at the cabin door, pushing it open with one hand behind
him, and backing out. Every second of the time, though, he kept his
blue green eyes fastened on his prisoners.

"I'll take them inside while you put the job away," he said to the
pilot. "Stick her way under the trees with that Waco, just in case some
nosy guys come flying over. Nuts to take chances, you know. We'll--"

"Can it!" the pilot snarled. "Who are you, giving orders? Take them
inside. I'll be along in a minute, and help tie them up. But keep that
gun ready, and use it if you have to. We can't risk anything, see?"

"I see, sure I see!" the redhead snarled back. "What's eating you,
anyway?"

"Nothing, and shut up!" the pilot said in a brittle voice.

The redhead nodded, and motioned with his gun to Dave and the other two.

"Out!" he snapped. "And watch it. And keep your hands in sight, too."

Dave obeyed to the letter, but his heart was thumping against his ribs.
He had a sneaky feeling that Colonel Welsh's words had had a profound
effect on the pilot. Sure, he had snarled, and boasted, and cursed the
United States, the land of his birth. But like all rats of his ilk,
deep down in his black heart he was scared stiff of the Old Man With
the Whiskers. Deep down in his heart he knew that he might get by with
this back stabbing for a little while--just like the Japs--but not for
long. In the end he would be caught in the wheels of right and justice
and be ground to a pulp.

With the pilot feeling as he obviously did, snapping and snarling at
his own partner in this dirty work, perhaps something could be made of
it. Perhaps--

Dave didn't finish the rest. Without realizing it he had sort of
stopped to mull things over as he climbed down from the plane. He had
unconsciously started to push one hand into his tunic pocket. He didn't
even realize he was making the movement, but the redhead saw it, took
it for the wrong thing, and moved with the speed of light. The barrel
of the automatic was slapped against the left side of Dave's jaw just
hard enough for him to see stars and stumble. He ended up by falling
the rest of the way out of the cabin doorway and landing flat on his
face on hard dirt.

"And stay there!" he heard the redhead growl. "I'll take that gun just
as soon as your two pals are down. Okay, you two. Out, and keep your
hands where I can see them. Okay! Now, flat on your bellies and hands
outstretched. Either of you move, and you get it."

A moment later Dave felt the muzzle of the automatic pressed against
the back of his head, and felt the redhead's other hand going through
his pockets. He didn't move a muscle, and presently an angry curse told
him that the redhead realized he was wrong. Then the gun tapped him
lightly on the head.

"Stay put, with your hands out!" the redhead said. "I'll just make sure
about your pals."

Dave kept his throbbing face buried in the dirt until he heard the
redhead's voice again.

"Okay, on your feet, and inside! And no more kidding moves like that
last one, Dawson. My trigger finger's getting plenty itchy. Okay, move!"

Dave got slowly to his feet, blinked from his eyes water caused by
smacking the ground with his face, and walked stiff-legged in through
the door of the nearest shack. He expected to step into a room heavy
with age, and dust, and dirt, and all the countless smells of the
years. But he didn't. He stepped into a large sized room that was
comfortably furnished and fitted out like a hunting lodge. No, not
exactly a hunting lodge. Rather, it looked more like an arsenal.
There were guns all over the place, of all types: pistols, automatics,
rifles, and machine guns. Along the entire right wall were heavy wood
boxes that obviously contained thousands and thousands of rounds of
ammunition.

But what caught Dave's eyes and held them was the powerful gas engine
operated short-wave radio receiving set and transmitter that took up
most of the space at the rear of the room. One glance told him that
every part of it was of the finest equipment, and that its operator
could contact points thousands and thousands of miles away. One look at
the set and he guessed instantly that one of its chief uses was to send
weather data to listening Axis ears. This was probably one of several
such stations hidden in the vastness of the United States. In time they
would be smoked out and destroyed. Meantime, though, they were serving
the Axis powers well, and, unquestionably, in a dozen different ways.

"Not bad, huh?" he heard the redhead's voice with its taunting note.
"We have lots of fun here, Mike and Ike. See what I mean, Colonel? We
got it all doped out. You Army and Navy guys are suckers. You don't
stand a chance, what I mean. When the time's right, we'll move in.
And that's all there'll be to it, see? Steady, Colonel! Steady, pal.
Rushing me will just get you a bullet in that belly of yours. Take it
easy, and relax. Back up, and sit down on that case. You two kids, too."

As the redhead grinned and made motions with the gun, Dave, Freddy,
and the Colonel slowly backed up until they were sitting on a couple
of gun cases. Once they were settled, with their hands carefully kept
in sight, the redhead hooked one leg over a nearby table and absently
stroked the palm of his other hand with the barrel of his automatic.
Dave heard Colonel Welsh's tight, rasping breathing beside him, but he
didn't look at the man. Nor did he glance at Freddy Farmer, who hadn't
spoken a word since they had entered the Stinson. Instead, Dave kept
his eyes fixed on the redhead--and waited, and hoped, and prayed.

"Yeah, we have us some fun here," the redhead went on, and looked
straight at Colonel Welsh. "But soon we're going to have some real fun.
See all these guns, Colonel? Lots of people are going to hear them pop
off, soon. People east in Washington, too. The boys running this show
have it all doped out. It'll be a cinch."

"Do you know what you are?" the Colonel suddenly asked with an effort.

"No, you tell me, Colonel," the redhead said with a chuckle. Then,
before Colonel Welsh could get a word in edgewise: "You know, I'd
never tab you for head of the Intelligence, Colonel. You don't look
the part to me at all. But maybe that's what's made you the great man
of mystery, eh? Well, the mystery is over as far as I'm concerned. And
to tell you the truth, I'm kind of disappointed. When we got the radio
flash that you were aboard a plane heading west with these two kids,
I got kind of all excited. I got kind of sorry, too, that I'd have to
shoot you down without having a look at you. But--well, I did get that
look after all. And I'm disappointed."

"And you are a complete and utter fool!" Colonel Welsh said,
tight-lipped. "I told you once, and I tell you again! You'll never get
away with this. You'll be caught and either strung up, or shot. You'll
get--"

"Didn't I tell you to shut up? Well, do it. We can't be bothered
listening to your junk. Shut up! _Do you hear me!_"

It was the voice of the pilot, who had suddenly appeared in the
doorway. He stood glaring at Colonel Welsh out of eyes that held a
wild, glassy glitter. Two white spots appeared on either cheek, and as
the last left his lips they came together to form a thin cruel line.
Then before Colonel Welsh, or Dave, or Freddy Farmer could so much as
move a muscle, the man leaped forward and slammed his upholstered gun
against the Colonel's left temple. The chief of U. S. Intelligence
slumped over, but caught himself and straightened up slowly. A trickle
of blood ran down from the cut on his temple, but he made no effort to
raise his hand to it. He looked at the pilot and smiled grimly. Dave
marveled silently at the man's courage and ability to take it. The blow
he had received was enough to knock over a horse.

"Swing again, you rat traitor!" the Colonel got out evenly. "You know
in your heart that you're sunk. And it's making you lose your grip."

For an instant Dave thought the pilot was going to go stark raving
mad with rage and hurl himself at the Colonel. But he didn't. With a
visibly tremendous effort he regained control of himself and forced a
harsh laugh off his lips.

"That's what you think!" he snapped. Then out of the corner of his
mouth to his partner: "Get that rope, and we'll tie them up. We'll gag
this big slob. I'm sick of hearing his yapping."

Less than five minutes later Dave and Freddy were bound hand and foot.
Colonel Welsh was bound hand and foot, too, but he was also gagged. The
pilot made sure that the ropes were tied right, then turned his back
on them and walked over to a table on the other side of the room. He
picked up a whiskey bottle there, took a long drink and choked on it.
He coughed so hard he almost dropped the bottle. He would have if the
redhead hadn't jumped quickly forward and grabbed it.

"Hey, what's the matter with you?" the redhead demanded angrily. "You
getting the jim-jams? This is no time to fall apart. Snap out of it.
Get hold of yourself. Boy! Wouldn't the big boss like to see you, now.
I knew he should have put me in charge of this station."

The pilot suddenly went white about the corners of his mouth, and there
was cold murder in the eyes he fixed on the redhead. He reached out and
tapped the redhead on the chest with the barrel of his automatic.

"Just say that again, lug," he grated. "Go on! Just say it again!"

The redhead seemed to wilt like a flower tossed into a blast furnace.
He gulped and swallowed hard, and backed away a couple of steps.

"Okay, okay!" he got out hastily. "I was only kidding. But I only
thought--"

"Nobody wants you to think!" the pilot snarled, and took a step
forward. "Get it? Cut out the thinking. Now, get on that key and
contact Frisco. Tell them we've got them on ice, and what do we do now?
Tell them this place is cooked, if either of these three should get
away. Find out where he wants them delivered, or what. He was nuts to
have us go hunting them, and bring them back here. They'd have been
stuck there a week, anyway. And that's more time than we need to fly
these guns and stuff to the other places. But skip that last. Don't
tell them that, understand. The big boy wouldn't like it."

"I'll say he wouldn't!" the redhead said with a tight laugh, and went
through the motions of slitting his throat from ear to ear. "Okay. I'll
find out what we do now. Fun, I hope."

The redhead flung the trio of prisoners a leering look, then went to
the back of the room and sat down at the radio equipment. A moment or
so later the crackling of the spark gap of a wireless set filled the
room. Dave closed his eyes and strained his ears. He caught the signal
being sent out. It was S-T. It was repeated a dozen times or more.
Then the man stopped sending, and there was silence as he listened to
whatever was coming through his earphones. After twenty seconds or so
he started sending again. Dave caught all the signals, but that's all
the good it did him. He glanced at Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh, and
knew that they were catching the signals, too, and that the code going
out over the air was just as meaningless to them as it was to him.

For five minutes the redhead "talked" with the man at the other end of
the wave length. Then he switched off his set, got up and turned around
with a grin on his face that stretched from ear to ear.

"He thinks we're great guys," he said to his partner. "He thinks we're
the nuts."

"Horses to what he thinks!" the pilot growled, and ran a nervous tongue
tip along his lower lip. "What do we do now? What are his orders?"

"To sit tight," the redhead said. Then, after flashing Colonel Welsh a
smirking look, he went on, "He's coming up here sometime tonight. He
didn't say, but I've got a hunch he wants to work on our three friends
here. But he's tickled silly about it all. What a break for us we were
bum shots last night. This little job puts us in good, I'm telling you.
Boy! You can't top the big boss, can you? He knows his onions right
down the line. Yeah! Old blabber mouth, there, is going to have plenty
of chance to work his yap. And I mean, but plenty! Maybe he won't want
to, but I've seen the big boss's way of getting guys to talk. He's got
a technique, he has!"

"Coming up tonight, huh?" the pilot echoed with a happy smile. "Swell!
That means you and me will be shifted to some other station. And
that'll suit me okay. This neck of the woods is giving me the creeps.
Thirty days here. It's been like thirty years. Let's have a drink on
getting out of here soon."

"Yeah!" the redhead said, and licked his lips. "Let's have a couple of
them. I'm dry as a bone."

With that moment began an hour and a half that was just about the
toughest ninety minutes Dave Dawson had ever spent in his life. The
two unshaven men went over to the table and dropped into chairs and
proceeded to ignore their prisoners. That didn't bother Dave in the
slightest, though. He was quite content to have the two ignore him,
for he was too busy with his thoughts--thoughts that tumbled and
spilled around in his brain like little red hot stones. A hundred times
at least he strained at the ropes that held his wrists bound behind
his back. And a hundred times circles of white pain about his wrists
convinced him that he didn't stand a chance in the world of freeing his
hands, to say nothing of his ankles. A hundred times he cursed himself
bitterly for not getting away from that attacker last night--and
without damage to the Lockheed's engines. A hundred times he thought of
the Aircraft Carrier Indian and the unknown doom that hovered over her;
the unknown doom that was aboard her in the form of some rat Axis spy
who had killed and obtained vital information that could easily spell
disaster for many of Uncle Sam's fighting men of the sea if it reached
Japanese hands soon enough.

A hundred times he thought of many things, and each time his utter
helplessness to do anything about them was like a hot knife twisting
in his heart. But the most torturing thing of all was the realization
that he and Freddy had been stopped cold before they had even been able
to get started. The Carrier Indian was over three hundred miles away,
riding at anchor in San Diego harbor. Who knew when they would see it?
Who knew if they would _ever_ see it? Caught cold before they had even
got started on the very first of the special assignments they were to
carry out for Uncle Sam. What a sweet beginning! Yes! What a sweet
beginning that could well be the end, too. And that end might come when
the man referred to as the big boss arrived.

Thoughts, thoughts, and more thoughts that walked, raced, cut and
slashed their way through Dave's brain. Seconds dragged on into
minutes, and the minutes seemed to drag on into an eternity of time.
Then suddenly sound forced its way through Dave's thoughts and brought
him back to the present. The sound was soft moaning and groaning. And
it came from Freddy Farmer's lips.

The English youth was sitting on a gun case just beyond where Colonel
Welsh sat, but out in front of him so that Dave could see his pal.
And the look on Freddy's face was one of great pain, and not a little
of terror, and fear. His eyes were half closed, and he seemed to be
staring at nothing at all as he rocked jerkily back and forth like some
African savage praying to his idol gods. For a brief instant Dave
could hardly believe his eyes or his ears. Then a wave of sympathy
mingled with just a little annoyance swept through him.

"Pull up your socks, Freddy!" he said in a low voice. "Show these rats
you can take it. Come on, Freddy. Chin up, pal!"

The English youth groaned louder and opened his eyes a little. The look
he flung Dave burned with scorn.

"Blast you and your chin-up rot!" he grated. "I've had enough of this.
Gangster stuff, this is, not war. I know now I should never have left
England. This is a madman's country. I tell you I've had enough of it!"

Freddy fairly screamed the last, and had Dave not been tied hand and
foot he would have leaped over and slapped his pal's jaw. Something had
happened to Freddy Farmer. Something had snapped inside of him. Dave
had seen his pal in a hundred tight corners, every bit as tight as this
one. He knew full well that Freddy was red-blooded courage from his
head to his feet. But something had happened, and the English youth was
ready to crack up like an hysterical old woman.

"Freddy, cut it out!" he snapped. "Buck up, old man. Show them. Come
on, Freddy. The old R.A.F. stuff. We're not licked yet, and we won't
be. You know that!"

The English youth didn't answer at once. He sat swaying and groaning,
and staring at Dave out of half closed eyes. Then suddenly he began to
laugh softly. The laugh grew and grew until it was almost a scream.
The pilot and the redhead had put down their whiskey glasses and were
staring at him in wide-eyed amazement.

"R.A.F., my hat!" Freddy suddenly shouted. "This isn't war. This is
gangster business, like I've seen in your American movies. Well, I've
had enough of it. I can't stand it, do you understand. _I can't stand
it!_ These ropes are killing me. I feel as if I were all on fire!"

Freddy stopped short, looked over at the unshaven pair and spoke again
before Dave had time to open his mouth.

"I say, a drink of water, please!" he gasped. "I must have a drink of
water. I'm dying, really. I can't stand the pain. A drink of water,
please!"

The pair stared for a moment longer; then the redhead burst out with
laughter.

"The tough English, huh?" he jeered aloud. "Look at the brave R.A.F.
pilot, I don't think! Well, what do you know? The English can't take
it. I always said they couldn't. Mama! Mama! Sonny boy wants a drink of
water. Here! Pour a slug of this whiskey down his throat and make a man
of him. Okay, I'll do it!"

The redhead laughed some more and splashed whiskey from the bottle into
his glass. He pushed up from the table and came swaggering over to
Freddy Farmer.

"Here you are, sonny boy," he said, and leaned over to put the glass to
the English youth's lips. "Be Papa's great big man. Have a drink. Go
on, take some!"

Freddy Farmer groaned just once more, then leaned forward as though he
were going to drink. But he didn't drink. He became an exploding ball
of chain lightning, instead. Almost before Dave Dawson's startled eyes
could register what was taking place, Freddy Farmer whipped his right
hand around from behind his back and plucked the redhead's automatic
from its holster. In what was practically the same motion, the English
youth stood up and clubbed the gun down on the redhead's ear. At the
same time Freddy brought up his left clenched fist and landed solidly
on the man's jaw. The man closed his eyes, and folded up like an old
army cot to the floor.

The English youth didn't so much as watch the redhead crumple. Instead
he brought the automatic down into line with the pilot sitting stunned
at the table on the other side of the room.

"Don't even wink an eye!" Freddy barked, and slowly sat down again. "I
can put a bullet in your rotten heart from here with my eyes closed.
Keep your hands just as they are on the table. Don't move them an inch,
you dirty blighter!"




CHAPTER TWELVE

_Westward To War_


As Freddy Farmer hurled the words at the pilot, he reached down with
his other hand and fumbled with the ropes tied about his ankles. In
less than a minute he had them free. Still keeping his eye on the
pilot, who now was practically green with terror, he went over and
around in back of the man. In less time than it takes to tell about it,
he had his gun. Then he jerked him from his chair and spun him around.

"Sorry, old thing," he said, tight-lipped. "But you shouldn't say
things like that about America. Next to England, it's the grandest
country on earth."

The pilot blinked stupidly. Then he closed his eyes for good. He did
so because Freddy Farmer slugged him on the jaw, putting every ounce
of his one hundred and fifty-five pounds behind the blow. The pilot
turned slowly around twice, then fell flat on his face alongside his
unconscious pal. And it was then Dave realized he was not dreaming, and
was able to find his tongue.

"Holy jumping jellyfish!" he gasped. "I--I thought you'd blown your
top, Freddy. But it was a gag, huh? Boy, oh boy! Me for you, pal, every
day in the week, and twice on Sundays. Gee, Freddy! I'm a no good bum
for thinking--"

"Quite!" the English youth said with a wide grin. "But I'll forgive you
this once. But speaking of gags. I'll free the Colonel, and then see
about you. Just cool your heels a bit, my little man."

Moving over to the Colonel, Freddy took the gag away and freed the
senior officer's hands and feet. It wasn't until he was completely free
that the Intelligence chief was able to speak.

"I'll never forget this, Farmer, never!" he exclaimed in a rush of
words. "One of the finest things I ever saw in my life. I can hardly
believe it even now. It--well, it was like magic. It must have been.
How in blue blazes did you manage to free your hands? Mine were tied so
tight they still feel broken in a dozen places."

As the Colonel spoke he rubbed his hands and wrists vigorously. Freddy
blushed to the roots of his hair, but there was a pleased grin on his
lips.

"They tied me pretty tight, too, sir," he said. "But a chap in England
once showed me a trick of holding your hands so that there's still a
little slack no matter how tight they're tied. It doesn't work with
most people. I mean you have to have thin hands, and be able to sort
of fold them up so's they're no thicker than your wrists. Then you can
slide the ropes off, if you work at it long enough. I--well, I was able
to do it. The moaning and the request for a drink was just to get one
of them close enough. I hope you don't think I meant the things I said,
sir."

"Don't worry," the Colonel said, and slapped Freddy on the shoulder.
"You can say anything you want, at any time, and it will always be
okay with me, after this. I mean it! You make me feel like an amateur,
Farmer. It was wonderful. But let's get these two tied up while they're
still listening to the birdies. What a sweet punch you've got, Farmer.
And at your weight, too! You'd keep Joe Louis busy any time. But let's
get at these two, and get going."

Freddy and the Colonel bent over the two prostrate forms and started
roping them up hand and foot. Dave watched for a moment, then made
sounds in his throat.

"Hey!" he shouted. "I'm here, you know!"

Freddy turned his head and looked at him. Bright lights danced in the
English youth's eyes.

"Why, so you are," he murmured, and gave the Colonel a quick wink.
"Just who are you? And when did you come in?"

"Cut the comedy!" Dawson howled. "Get these confounded ropes off me, or
I'll fan your breeches plenty next time I get my hands on you, young
fellow!"

Freddy shrugged, pursed his lips and cocked an eyebrow at the Colonel.

"Bit violent, isn't he?" he grunted. "Think we should let him loose, or
wait a bit until he cools down?"

"I don't know," the Colonel said with a chuckle. "You're the boss. Do
as you think best. Maybe, if he said 'pretty please,' or something."

"Quite," Freddy said, and turned to Dave. "Say 'pretty please,' and
I'll consider it," he grinned.

Dave looked daggers, and pressed his lips tightly together. Freddy
sighed, stood up and started brushing dust off his uniform.

"What do we do now, sir?" he asked, and deliberately turned his back
on Dawson. "Want me to fly you to San Diego, and have somebody come
back for these three? Or--"

"Okay, okay, you win, you sawed off made in England little runt!" Dave
roared. "Pretty please, confound you. Now untie me, for cat's sake."

Freddy walked over to him and leveled a reprimanding finger.

"Such a tone of voice!" he admonished sternly. "Say it nicely, just as
you were taught in school, now."

Dave turned forty different colors of the rainbow, but he finally
managed to swallow his wrath.

"Pretty please," he said. "I will remember this moment always. And I
mean _always_, you cluck!"

Freddy laughed, and in half a minute had Dave free. As he pulled the
last rope loose, he stepped quickly backward and set himself for the
expected rush. But Dave simply rubbed his hands and wrists and glared
at him.

"Relax!" he growled. "I'm going to save this one up, you betcha! And
when the right time comes, will you sing a song and dance a dance for
me! Kidding aside, though, Freddy, that was something. I really mean
it. Boy! Can you always come up with something new! But don't think
that means I'm going to forget, you little bum. My turn will come."

Freddy grinned at him impishly, and then both stopped their horse play
and turned serious eyes toward the Colonel.

"We can still make San Diego with time to spare, sir," Dave said with a
glance at his watch. "Are we going to take those two along with us?"

"We certainly are," the Colonel said, and pointed a finger at the
pilot. "That one is just ripe to be cracked wide open. He'll blab
everything he knows to save his own neck. I've met his type often. Hard
as nails on the surface, but completely yellow underneath."

"It's pretty hard to believe that a couple of Americans would stoop
this low," Dave said, tight-lipped. "But I suppose the Axis has a fifth
column working here in the States just as they had in every other
country they tackled."

"True enough," the Colonel replied with a nod. "And as the saying
goes, some men will sell their souls for gold. Those two are the type.
Country and flag don't mean a thing to them. Something twisted inside
of them. They weren't put together right in the first place. But this
is a big thing for my bureau, boys! And for the F.B.I., too. I have
a hunch I know who their big boss is--a man the F.B.I.'s been after
for weeks. There'll be a welcoming committee waiting for him tonight.
Have no fear of that. Before we get going, however, I want to have a
quick look around here. Give me a hand. Maybe we'll find something of
importance. We've got an hour or so, haven't we?"

"Easy," Dave replied. "Shall we hunt for something special?"

"Hunt for anything!" the Colonel said grimly. "And pray for a miracle
find."

Exactly one hour and six minutes later they had finished going over
the room with fine tooth comb thoroughness. The net result was a batch
of papers that the Colonel clutched in his hand. A couple of them had
lists of names and addresses. The others were covered with messages
that were all in code, and couldn't be broken down right at the moment.
The Colonel was pleased with the results, but there was just the
slightest gleam of disappointment in his eyes. Dave saw the gleam and
wondered.

"We didn't find the miracle, sir?" he asked. "What was it?"

The Colonel tapped the papers and shook his head.

"It could be in this stuff, but I doubt it," he said. "I mean a clue
that would help us with the Carrier Indian business. However, I don't
think--"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence suddenly stopped, and a cold hard
glint came into his eyes. He turned around and stared down at the two
trussed up men on the floor. Both had recovered consciousness and were
watching him out of eyes brimming with terror. The Colonel eyed them
for a moment, then stepped forward and deliberately picked up one of
the two automatics Freddy had placed on the table. Turning, he sighted
the gun and pulled the trigger. The gun roared sound and flame. A hole
appeared in the floor a half inch from the redhead's left ear, and the
man screamed like a stuck pig. Colonel Welsh leveled the gun again and
drilled a hole in the floor a half inch from the redhead's other ear.

"See?" he barked. "I know a little about trick shooting, myself. Okay.
How's this for a bull's-eye? Right between those two. Right on the end
of your nose!"

The man screamed and writhed about on the floor.

"Don't, don't!" he gasped. "Oh, please don't, Colonel! Don't let me
have it."

"Then what about your brother rat aboard the Carrier Indian?" Colonel
Welsh thundered. "Who is he? What name is he using? What's his rank?
Speak up, you! I've got an itchy trigger finger, too!"

The redhead gasped, and gurgled, and choked, and sobbed in a desperate
effort to get the words out of his mouth in a hurry.

"I don't know, I don't know!" he cried. "We don't know anything about
the Carrier Indian. Honestly, we don't, Colonel. We just got orders
to stop you and these two kids from getting to San Diego. We only got
orders to stop them from going aboard the Indian. We don't know nothing
about her, honest to Pete. We don't even know why our boss didn't want
them two kids to go aboard. That's the truth, on my word of honor."

"You have no honor!" the Colonel told him coldly. Then he slowly
sighted the gun on a point between the pilot's eyes. "Well?" he
demanded. "You tell me then!"

The pilot turned white as a sheet under his beard, and looked as if he
were going to faint. His eyes popped way out, and spittle drooled out
the corners of his mouth.

"I don't know either!" he cried hoarsely. "So help me, Colonel, I'm
willing to spill everything I know. But I don't know a thing about the
Indian business. Go on, shoot me right between the eyes if I'm telling
you any lie. We just manned this station. And like he said, we got
orders to stop those two from going aboard the Indian. So help me!
That's the truth!"

Colonel Welsh hesitated, then shrugged and stuck the gun in his pocket.

"It was too much to hope for, anyway," he muttered more to himself.
"Let's get going. You lads get the plane started while I lug these two
outside. A mighty big day for America so far. Now, if only you two
can--"

The senior officer sighed and let the rest hang in the air. Then he
bent over, caught each man by the heels, and hauled them out into the
brilliant sunshine like a couple of logs. They yelped and babbled with
pain, but the Colonel had deaf ears. Twenty minutes later the two fifth
column prisoners were stowed aboard the Stinson, and the plane's props
were ticking over. Dave and Freddy had refilled the tanks from tins of
gas they found in the second shack. The shiny thing that Dave had seen
under the trees from the air proved to be a high speed Waco fitted with
two machine guns. For a moment they debated whether or not one of them
should fly it back. On second thought, though, they decided it was best
for them all to stick together in the same ship, and let somebody else
pick up the Waco later.

"Okay, all aboard!" Dave finally announced, and gave Freddy a friendly
slap on the back. "Go on and fly her, pal. You've sure earned the
honor. And, heck, my nerves can stand anything, now."

"I knew the compliment would have a nasty ending to it!" the English
youth growled, and shook his head. "No, fly her yourself. I've done my
share of work today. Besides, you know this neck of the world. I don't."

"Well, somebody fly it!" Colonel Welsh shouted from inside the cabin.
"We've still got to get to San Diego, you know. Come on, snap it up,
you two!"

"Okay!" Dave growled, and shouldered Freddy Farmer out of the way. "If
I must I must. Who was your slave last year, Mister?"

"Same chap," Freddy said with a chuckle. "And his good manners haven't
improved a bit. San Diego, my good man! And in a bit of a hurry,
please!"

"Very good, sir!" Dave grunted and made a face. "And you can guess what
I'm _thinking_!"




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

_Death Strikes Often_


A huge ball of gold and red hung balanced on the western lip of
the world. Shafts of shimmering fire radiated out from it in all
directions. They filled the sky with a mixture of shades that ranged
from a delicate pink to blood red. They bathed the earth with the same
hues, and seemed actually to creep into every nook and corner. The line
of planes on the San Diego field looked like the work of an imaginative
artist on nature's canvas rather than the real thing. It was a sight
to hold the eye and catch the breath--but Dave Dawson stared at it and
wasn't even conscious of what he was looking at.

He and Freddy Farmer were in the field Commandant's office, waiting for
Colonel Welsh to show up. But that was just the trouble. They had been
waiting for three solid hours for the Intelligence chief to return from
wherever he had gone. Three hours before Dave had put the Stinson down
on the field. At Colonel Welsh's order he had taxied it straight into
an empty hangar and cut the engines. The Colonel had jumped out and
disappeared for five minutes. He had returned with the field's C.O. and
a half dozen mechanics, and a closed car. The two fifth columnists had
been dumped in the car, and driven away. After hasty introductions to
the field Commandant, the Colonel had led them over to the field office
and told them to wait for him to return.

That had been three hours ago, and they were still waiting.

"Stop worrying, and come finish this food they sent over," Freddy
Farmer presently broke the silence. "Good grief, Dave, it doesn't do
any good to wear out the floor like that. Come on and have some more to
eat. Eggs, mind you! I haven't had an egg since I don't know when."

"You and your stomach!" Dave grated, and half turned from the window.
"You should choke on them. Look out there. The Indian! If they're
not getting ready to weigh anchor, then I'm nuts! Where is that guy,
anyway? He should have told us that--Jeepers!"

Freddy stopped some egg halfway to his mouth and looked up.

"What?" he demanded. "What's the matter?"

"The Colonel," Dave said with an effort. "I mean--I sure hope nothing's
happened to him."

Freddy Farmer considered that for a moment, then shrugged and carried
the egg the rest of the way to his mouth.

"Not likely, I think," he finally said. "Probably got those two chaps
to talk. Maybe it's made a difference. I mean, maybe he's decided to
call off this Indian show. Wouldn't mind that at all. They might post
us here at this field. Wonderful food, you know."

"It certainly _sounds_ good!" Dave cracked. Then, glancing out the
window again: "I sure hope they don't call off the show. That Indian
looks pretty nice to me out there. I could go for a trip on her.
Besides, I'm itching to take a whack or six at those dirty Japs. I
think I hate them worse than the Nazis, Freddy."

"Me, too, if that's possible," the English youth replied. "But I was
really talking just to hear myself. I'd like a trip on the Indian,
too. She's the latest of her class, and should have everything. Also,
according to the Colonel, she's steaming out to do battle. I could
fancy a little combat work. Doesn't pay to get rusty. My, but that meal
was good!"

"What a man!" Dave sighed at the window. "On an empty stomach he's not
worth a dime. Fill him up and he's a one man air force, and raring to
go. He's--"

Dave stopped short and wheeled quickly as the door opened and Colonel
Welsh came inside. The man's face was grim, and there was the look of
angry defeat in his eyes.

"Sorry I took so long, fellows," he said, and dropped into a chair. "I
had to check up on a few things, and get a few things underway. Took
longer than I figured."

"Those rats told the truth, eh?" Dave grunted. "They still don't know a
thing about the Indian?"

The Colonel shook his head and clenched his two fists in a helpless
gesture.

"Not a thing!" he got out savagely. "But they seem to be the only two
who don't."

"What do you mean by that, sir?" Freddy asked.

"Well, I don't mean it exactly the way I put it," the Colonel said with
a shake of his head. "But it seems the entire Axis organization in this
country has found out that their agent aboard the Indian has stolen the
battle plans of the carrier, and that I was to put four men aboard to
try and trap him and nail him to the mast. Those two agents of mine,
and you two."

"Your two agents got aboard last night, sir?" Dave prompted as the
senior officer stopped talking abruptly.

"No," was the bitter reply. "They were shot and killed as they stepped
into the waiting tender at the Navy pier."

"Shot?" Dave gasped. "Gee! That was tough. I hope the killers were
caught."

"They were, and captured dead," the Colonel said bluntly. "Two
waterfront rats. Looked that, anyway. One a Jap, obviously. The other
looked like a German. No papers or anything on him, though. So he could
have been almost any nationality. But the important thing is, that I
found the leak in my own organization. I put through a call to Captain
Lamb and he told me. He'd sent word to our San Diego office last night
for me to contact him at once. I called him, and--"

"The bloke reading the book in your outer office!" Freddy Farmer cried.

"The man who ran the elevator!" Dave exclaimed.

Colonel Welsh caught his breath and shot a hard look at Dawson.

"How did you know?" he demanded.

"I didn't," Dave replied. "But I had a hunch it might be one of those
two. It had to be somebody close to you, and--well, Freddy had already
picked the one in the outer office."

"It was the one who brought you up in the elevator," Colonel Welsh
said with an effort. "It's--it's things like this that almost make me
lose faith. That man had been in the bureau for six years. For four
years before that he was connected with Secret Service. His record was
spotless. And the amazing part is that he had performed some valuable
services for me. But that goes to show you the finesse of the Gestapo
and Nazi agent technique. Shows you how long ago Hitler laid plans for
America. I would have staked my life on Babson, but--"

The officer paused and gestured despairingly.

"But of course I would have lost my life!" he suddenly bit off. "But
for an accident I'd never have found out, perhaps. And who knows what
else that would have cost us? He was taking Lamb down late last night.
As he opened the doors a slip of paper fell out of his pocket. Lamb
caught it in mid-air, and was starting to hand it back when he saw
what was on the paper. It was a bit of code, obviously jotted down in
a hurry. But it was a code that only Lamb and I knew, not another
soul in the world. For years he and I have been working on a code that
can't possibly be broken down by any of the experts. We thought we had
found it. Kept our papers on it in a safe. Only Lamb and I knew the
combination--we thought."

"What happened, sir?" Freddy asked eagerly as Colonel Welsh let his
voice trail off into silence. "Did Captain Lamb make the dirty beggar
confess?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence shook his head.

"He didn't have time," he said. "Babson realized instantly that he'd
never in the world be able to explain his possession of that bit of
copied code. His only hope was quick action, and flight. He went for
his gun. Lamb didn't give me the details of the fight. He won, and
Babson is dead. Then Lamb got busy. He began with the little office
Babson used on the ground floor. He--It seems incredible! I thought
that Lamb was crazy, or blind drunk, and making it up. But he wasn't,
of course. Babson had actually installed a dictograph in our working
room. The other end was in his office. The wire led out behind the
files, under the corridor boards and down the elevator shaft, and
under the lobby floor to his office. He could hear every word we said
up there. How he learned that safe combination, we'll probably never
find out. In his Washington hotel room Lamb found enough stuff to hang
the man a dozen times over. Too bad we won't be able to do it. I feel
like going out and shooting myself. I'm the one responsible, of course.
One of my own trusted men! That's the worst of it!"

The Colonel gave a bewildered shake of his head, and groaned heavily.

"That's war, I guess," Dave murmured sympathetically. "And the same
thing has happened in other countries, sir. It isn't going to help any
to take it too hard, you know. Anyway, the rat is dead, and the leak is
plugged up. That's something, at least."

"But mighty little!" the Colonel said bitterly. Then, stabbing a
finger at the window facing the harbor, he grated, "There's the Indian
out there. In an hour she weighs anchor. Aboard her is the most
dangerous rat of all. He possesses information that could well mean the
difference between victory and defeat if it falls into Jap hands. We
can't hold the Indian. She's got to sail. Without her the whole battle
plan is mixed up. Yet if she sails and we don't catch that scoundrel,
who knows what will happen? I had hoped, but--well, now that's all
shot, too."

"What's all shot, sir?" Dave asked quickly.

"The job I had planned for you and Farmer aboard the Indian," the
Colonel replied. "It was a wild hope even at best, but now it isn't
even that. The rats know why I wanted you two aboard her. True, maybe
the man you're after doesn't know. I've a feeling, though, he does.
The way things have gone, I feel certain they got word to him somehow.
If they did, he'd know exactly why you were there the moment you came
over the side. And--well, to put it bluntly, he's killed twice already.
Twice more wouldn't bother him if he suspected you were getting close
to him. He'd--"

"We can watch our step," Dave cut in grimly.

"Too great a risk," the Colonel replied. "You see, it wouldn't be a
matter of your actually getting close, but the matter of his _thinking_
that you _were_ close. He'd know who you were, and why you were aboard.
The advantage would be all his. It would be unfair to ask any man to
tackle a job like that."

"I don't fancy so, sir," Freddy Farmer spoke up quietly. "After all,
rats usually do have all the advantage until you get them cornered.
Supposing he does know why we're there? Let him, I say. It's a job to
be done, and somebody's got to tackle it, sir. Good grief! If somebody
doesn't go after the blighter, it's like letting the Indian sail with a
lighted fuse leading to her powder magazine."

"I check on that, too, sir!" Dave cried eagerly. "Freddy and I aren't
trying to toot our horns, Colonel. Maybe we'll fall flat on our faces.
But maybe we won't. However, at least we'll be aboard in case something
does turn up that gives us a clue."

"Yes, of course," the Colonel grunted, and frowned. "That's quite true.
But you could be throwing your lives away--and uselessly, too. You two
helped accomplish something almost as big today, perhaps even bigger. I
can't say yet. But capturing those two American born rats was a mighty
big step toward smashing a lot of the Fifth Column business in this
country. I mean that, too. That place was one of their arsenals where
they've cached guns to be used when Berlin sends the order to strike
at the United States from within. It's one of several arsenals located
about the country. Those papers contained names and addresses of key
men in their organization. And right now some of my agents, and F.B.I.
agents, are waiting in that shack for the so-called big boss. His
capture alone will be something mighty big. Yes, you two played a major
part today in nipping something big in the bud. So it isn't fair to ask
you to--"

"Okay, okay!" Dave suddenly snapped. "If you don't think we rate a
crack at it, then have the Indian sail without us. I'm willing to take
the chance. So's Freddy. But if you think we'd mess up things, then
skip it. Let it slide."

The Colonel blinked and gave Dave a startled look. It wasn't every datian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of J
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
002:046 It happened after three days they found him in the temple,
        sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them,
        and asking them questions.
002:047 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
002:048 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother
        said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way?prophet.
013:021 Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son
        of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty yearf heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond treshall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
        or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken
        at the cistern,
012:007 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
        returns to God who gave it.
012:008 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
012:009 Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge.  Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set
        in order many proverbs.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

No, mortals blended by terror! The friend of nature is not your enemy;
its interpreter is not the minister of falsehood; the destroyer of your
vain phantoms is not the devastator of those truths necessary to your
happiness; the disciple of reason is not an irrational being, who either
seeks to poison you, or to infect you with a dangerous delirium. If
he is desirous to wrest the thunder from those terrible theories that
affright ye, it is that ye way discontinue your march, in the midst
of storms, over roads that ye can only distinguish by the sudden, but
evanescent glimmerings of the electric fluid. If he breaks those idols,
which fear has served with myrrh and frankencense--which superstition
has surrounded by gloomy despondency--which fanaticism has imbrued with
blood; it is to substitute in their place those consoling truths that
are calculated to heal the desperate wounds ye have received; that are
suitable to inspire you with courage, sturdily to oppose yourselves
to such dangerous errors; that have power to enable you to resist such
formidable enemies. If he throws down the temples, overturns the altars,
so frequently bathed with the bitter tears of the unfortunate, blackened
by the most cruel sacrifices, smoked with servile incense, it is that he
may erect a fane sacred to peace; a hall dedicated to reason; a durable
monument to virtue, in which ye may at all times find an asylum against
your own phrenzy; a refuge from your own ungovernable passions; a
sanctuary against those powerful dogmatists, by whom ye are oppressed.
If he attacks the haughty pretensions of deified tyrants, who crush ye
with an iron sceptre, it is that ye may enjoy the rights of your nature;
it is to the end that ye may be substantively freemen, in mind as well
as in body; that ye may not be slaves, eternally chained to the oar of
misery; it is that ye may at length be governed by men who are citizens,
who may cherish their own semblances, who way protect mortals like
themselves, who may actually consult the interests of those from
whom they hold their power. If he battles with imposture, it is to
re-establish truth in those rights which have been so long usurped by
fiction. If he undermines the base of that unsteady, fanatical morality,
which has hitherto done nothing more than perplex your minds, without
correcting your hearts; it is to give to ethics an immovable basis, a
solid foundation, secured upon your own nature; upon the reciprocity of
those wants which are continually regenerating in sensible beings: dare,
then, to listen to his voice; you will find it much more intelligible
than those ambiguous oracles, which are announced to you as the
offspring of capricious theories; as imperious decrees that are
unceasingly at variance with themselves. Listen then to nature, she
never contradicts her own eternal laws.

"O thou!" cries this nature to man, "who, following the impulse I
have given you, during your whole existence, incessantly tend towards
happiness, do not strive to resist my sovereign law. Labour to your own
felicity; partake without fear of the banquet which is spread before
you, with the most hearty welcome; you will find the means legibly
written on your own heart. Vainly dost thou, O superstitious being! seek
after thine happiness beyond the limits of the universe, in which my
hand hath placed thee: vainly shalt thou search it in those inexorable
theories, which thine imagination, ever prone to wander, would establish
upon my eternal throne: vainly dost thou expect it in those fanciful
regions, to which thine own delirium hath given a locality and a shame:
vainly dost thou reckon upon capricious systems, with whose advantages
thou art in such ecstasies; whilst they only fill thine abode with
calamity--thine heart with dread--thy mind with illusions--thy bosom
with groans. Know that when thou neglectest my counsels, the gods will
refuse their aid. Dare, then, to affranchise thyself from the trammels
of superstition, my self-conceited, pragmatic rival, who mistakes
my rights; renounce those empty theories, which are usurpers of my
privileges; return under the dominion of my laws, which, however severe,
are mild in comparison with those of bigotry. It is in my empire
alone that true liberty reigns. Tyranny is unknown to its soil; equity
unceasingly watches over the rights of all my subjects, maintains
them in the possession of their just claims; benevolence, grafted upon
humanity, connects them by amicable bonds; truth enlightens them; never
can imposture blind them with his obscuring mists. Return, then,
my child, to thy fostering mother's arms! Deserter, trace back thy
wandering steps to nature! She will console thee for thine evils; she
will drive from thine heart those appalling fears which overwhelm thee;
those inquietudes that distract thee; those transports which agitate
thee; those hatreds that separate thee from thy fellow man, whom thou
shouldst love as thyself. Return to nature, to humanity, to thyself!
Strew flowers over the road of life: cease to contemplate the future;
live to thine own happiness; exist for thy fellow creatures; retire into
thyself, examine thine own heart, then consider the sensitive beings by
whom thou art surrounded: leave to their inventors those systems which
can effect nothing towards thy felicity. Enjoy thyself, and cause others
also to enjoy, those comforts which I have placed with a liberal hand,
for all the children of the earth; who all equally emanate from my
bosom: assist them to support the sorrows to which necessity has
submitted them in common with thyself. Know, that I approve thy
pleasures, when without injuring thyself, they are not fatal to thy
brethren, whom I have rendered indispensably necessary to thine own
individual happiness. These pleasures are freely permitted thee, if thou
indulgest them with moderation; with that discretion which I myself have
fixed. Be happy, then, O man! Nature invites thee to participate in it;
but always remember, thou canst not be so alone; because I invite all
mortals to happiness as well as thyself; thou will find it is only in
securing their felicity that thou canst consolidate thine own. Such is
the decree of thy destiny: if thou shalt attempt to withdraw thyself
from its operation, recollect that hatred will pursue thee; vengeance
overtake thy steps; and remorse be ever ready at hand to punish the
infractions of its irrevocable mandates.

"Follow then, O man! in whatever station thou findest thyself, the
routine I have described for thee, to obtain that happiness to which
thou hast an indispensable right to challenge pretension. Let the
sensations of humanity interest thee for the condition of other men, who
are thy fellow creatures; let thine heart have commisseration for their
misfortunes: let thy generous hand spontaneously stretch forth to lend
succour to the unhappy mortal who is overwhelmed by his destiny; always
bearing in thy recollection, that it may fall heavy upon thyself, as
it now does upon him. Acknowledge, then, without guile, that every
unfortunate has an inalienable right to thy kindness. Above all, wipe
from the eyes of oppressed innocence the trickling crystals of agonized
feeling; let the tears of virtue in distress, fall upon thy sympathizing
bosom; let the genial glow of sincere friendship animate thine honest
heart; let the fond attachment of a mate, cherished by thy warmest
affection, make thee forget the sorrows of life: be faithful to her
love, responsible to her tenderness, that she may reward thee by
a reciprocity of feeling; that under the eyes of parents united in
virtuous esteem, thy offspring may learn to set a proper value on
practical virtue; that after having occupied thy riper years, they may
comfort thy declining age, gild with content thy setting sun, cheer the
evening of thine existence, by a dutiful return of that care which thou
shalt have bestowed on their imbecile infancy.

"Be just, because equity is the support of human society! Be good,
because goodness connects all hearts in adamantine bonds! Be indulgent,
because feeble thyself, thou livest with beings who partake of thy
weakness! Be gentle, because mildness attracts attention! Be thankful,
because gratitude feeds benevolence, nourishes generosity! Be modest,
because haughtiness is disgusting to beings at all times well with
themselves. Forgive injuries, because revenge perpetuates hatred! Do
good to him who injureth thee, in order to shew thyself more noble than
he is; to make a friend of him, who was once thine enemy! Be reserved
in thy demeanor, temperate in thine enjoyment, chaste in thy pleasures,
because voluptuousness begets weariness, intemperance engenders disease;
forward manners are revolting: excess at all times relaxes the springs
of thy machine, will ultimately destroy thy being, and render thee
hateful to thyself, contemptible to others.

"Be a faithful citizen; because the community is necessary to thine own
security; to the enjoyment of thine own existence; to the furtherance
of thine own happiness. Be loyal, but be brave; submit to legitimate
authority; because it is requisite to the maintenance of that society
which is necessary to thyself. Be obedient to the laws; because they
_are_, or _ought to be_, the expression of the public will, to which
thine own particular will ought ever to be subordinate. Defend thy
country with zeal; because it is that which renders thee happy, which
contains thy property, as well as those beings dearest to thine heart:
do not permit this common parent of thyself, as well as of thy fellow
citizens, to fall under the shackles of tyranny; because from thence
it will be no more than thy common prison. If thy country, deaf to the
equity of thy claims, refuses thee happiness--if, submitted to an unjust
power, it suffers thee to be oppressed, withdraw thyself from its bosom
in silence, but never disturb its peace.

"In short, be a man; be a sensible, rational being; be a faithful
husband; a tender father; an equitable master; a zealous citizen; labour
to serve thy country by thy prowess; by thy talents; by thine industry;
above all, by thy virtues. Participate with thine associates those gifts
which nature has bestowed upon thee; diffuse happiness, among thy fellow
mortals; inspire thy fellow citizens with content; spread joy over all
those who approach thee, that the sphere of thine actions, enlivened by
thy kindness, illumined by thy benevolence, may re-act upon thyself; be
assured that the man who makes others happy cannot himself be miserable.
In thus conducting thyself, whatever may be the injustice of others,
whatever may be the blindness of those beings with whom it is thy
destiny to live, thou wilt never be totally bereft of the recompense
which is thy due; no power on earth be able to ravish from thee that
never failing source of the purest felicity, inward content; at each
moment thou wilt fall back with pleasure upon thyself; thou wilt neither
feel the rankling of shame, the terror of internal alarm, nor find
thy heart corroded by remorse. Thou wilt esteem thyself; thou wilt be
cherished by the virtuous, applauded and loved by all good men, whose
suffrages are much more valuable than those of the bewildered
multitude. Nevertheless, if externals occupy thy contemplation, smiling
countenances will greet thy presence; happy faces will express the
interest they have in thy welfare; jocund beings will make thee
participate in their placid feelings. A life so spent, will each moment
be marked by the serenity of thine own soul, by the affection of the
beings who environ thee; will be made cheerful by the friendship of thy
fellows; will enable thee to rise a contented, satisfied guest from the
general feast; conduct thee gently down the declivity of life, lead thee
peaceably to the period of thy days; for die thou must: but already
thou wilt survive thyself in thought; thou wilt always live in the
remembrance of thy friends; in the grateful recollection of those beings
whose comforts have been augmented by thy friendly attentions; thy
virtues will, beforehand have erected to thy fame an imperishable
monument: if heaven occupies itself with thee, it will feel satisfied
with thy conduct, when it shall thus have contented the earth.

"Beware, then, how thou complainest of thy condition; be just, be kind,
be virtuous, and thou canst never be wholly destitute of felicity. Take
heed how thou enviest the transient pleasure of seductive crime; the
deceitful power of victorious tyranny; the specious tranquillity of
interested imposture; the plausible manners of venal justice; the shewy,
ostentatious parade of hardened opulence. Never be tempted to increase
the number of sycophants to an ambitious despot; to swell the catalogue
of slaves to an unjust tyrant; never suffer thyself to be allured to
infamy, to the practice of extortion, to the commission of outrage, by
the fatal privilege of oppressing thy fellows; always recollect it will
be at the expence of the most bitter remorse thou wilt acquire this
baneful advantage. Never be the mercenary accomplice of the spoilers of
thy country; they are obliged to blush secretly whenever they meet the
public eye.

"For, do not deceive thyself, it is I who punish, with an unerring hand,
all the crimes of the earth; the wicked may escape the laws of man, but
they never escape mine. It is I who have formed the hearts, as well
an the bodies of mortals; it is I who have fixed the laws which govern
them. If thou deliverest thyself up to voluptuous enjoyment, the
companions of thy debaucheries may applaud thee; but I shall punish thee
with the most cruel infirmities; these will terminate a life of shame
with deserved contempt. If thou givest, thyself up to intemperate
indulgences, human laws may not correct thee, but I shall castigate thee
severely by abridging thy days. If thou art vicious, thy fatal habits
will recoil on thine own head. Princes, those terrestrial divinities,
whose power places them above the laws of mankind, are nevertheless
obliged to tremble under the silent operation of my decrees. It is I who
chastise them; it is I who fill their breasts with suspicion; it is
I who inspire them with terror; it is I who make them writhe under
inquietude; it is I who make them shudder with horror, at the very name
of august truth; it is I who, amidst the crowd of nobles who surround
them, make them feel the inward workings of shame; the keen anguish of
guilt; the poisoned arrows of regret; the cruel stings of remorse; it is
I who, when they abuse my bounty, diffuse weariness over their benumbed
souls; it is I who follow uncreated, eternal justice; it is I who,
without distinction of persons, know how to make the balance even; to
adjust the chastisement to the fault; to make the misery bear its due
proportion to the depravity; to inflict punishment commensurate with the
crime. The laws of man are just, only when they are in conformity with
mine; his judgements are rational, only when I have dictated them: my
laws alone are immutable, universal, irrefragable; formed to regulate
the condition of the human race, in all ages, in all places, under all
circumstances.

"If thou doubtest mine authority, if thou questionest the irresistible
power I possess over mortals, contemplate the vengeance I wreak on all
those who resist my decrees. Dive into the recesses of the hearts of
those various criminals, whose countenances, assuming a forced smile,
cover souls torn with anguish. Dost thou not behold ambition tormented
day and night, with an ardour which nothing can extinguish? Dost not
thou see the mighty conquerer become the lord of devastated solitudes;
his victorious career, marked by a blasted cultivation, reign
sorrowfully over smoking ruins; govern unhappy wretches who curse him in
their hearts; while his soul, gnawed by remorse, sickens at the gloomy
aspect of his own triumphs? Dost thou believe that the tyrant, encircled
with his flatterers, who stun him with their praise, is unconscious of
the hatred which his oppression excites; of the contempt which his vices
draw upon him; of the sneers which his inutility call forth; of the
scorn which his debaucheries entail upon his name? Dost thou think that
the haughty courtier does not inwardly blush at the galling insults he
brooks; despise, from the bottom of his soul, those meannesses by
which he is compelled to purchase favours; feel at his heart's core the
wretched dependence in which his cupidity places him.

"Contemplate the indolent child of wealth, behold him a prey to the
lassitude of unmeasured enjoyment, corroded by the satiety which always
follows his exhausted pleasures. View the miser with an emaciated
countenance, the consequence of his own penurious disposition, whose
callous heart is inaccessible to the calls of misery, groaning over the
accumulating load of useless treasure, which at the expense of himself,
he has laboured to amass. Behold the gay voluptuary, the smiling
debaucheé, secretly lament the health they have so inconsiderately
damaged so prodigally thrown away: see disdain, joined to hatred, reign
between those adulterous married couples, who have reciprocally violated
the sacred vows they mutually pledged at the altar of Hymen; whose
appetencies have rendered them the scorn of the world; the jest of their
acquaintance; polluted tributaries to the surgeon. See the liar
deprived of all confidence; the knave stript of all trust; the hypocrite
fearfully avoiding the penetrating looks of his inquisitive neighbour;
the impostor trembling at the very name of formidable truth. Bring under
your review the heart of the envious, uselessly dishonored; that withers
at the sight of his neighbour's prosperity. Cast your eyes on the frozen
soul of the ungrateful wretch, whom no kindness can warm, no benevolence
thaw, no beneficence convert into a genial fluid. Survey the iron
feelings of that monster whom the sighs of the unfortunate cannot
mollify. Behold the revengeful being nourished with venemous gall, whose
very thoughts are serpents; who in his rage consumes himself. Envy, if
thou canst, the waking slumbers of the homicide; the startings of the
iniquitous judge; the restlessness of the oppressor of innocence; the
fearful visions of the extortioner; whose couches are infested with the
torches of the furies. Thou tremblest without doubt at the sight of
that distraction which, amidst their splendid luxuries, agitates those
farmers of the revenue, who fatten upon public calamnity--who devour the
substance of the orphan--who consume the means of the widow--who grind
the hard earnings of the poor: thou shudderest at witnessing the remorse
which rends the souls of those reverend criminals, whom the uninformed
believe to be happy, whilst the contempt which they have for themselves,
the unerring shafts of secret upbraidings, are incessantly revenging
an outraged nation. Thou seest, that content is for ever banished the
heart; quiet for ever driven from the habitations of those miserable
wretches on whose minds I have indelibly engraved the scorn, the infamy,
the chastisement which they deserve. But, no! thine eyes cannot sustain
the tragic spectacle of my vengeance. Humanity obliges thee to partake
of their merited sufferings; thou art moved to pity for these unhappy
people, to whom consecrated errors renders vice necessary; whose fatal
habits make them familiar with crime. Yes; thou shunnest them without
hating them; thou wouldst succour them, if their contumacious perversity
had left thee the means. When thou comparest thine own condition, when
thou examinest thine own soul, thou wilt have just cause to felicitate
thyself, if thou shalt find that peace has taken up her abode with thee;
that contentment dwells at the bottom of thine own heart. In short, thou
seest accomplished upon them, as well as, upon thyself, the unalterable
decrees of destiny, which imperiously demand, that crime shall punish
itself, that virtue never shall be destitute Of remuneration."

Such is the sum of those truths which are contained in the _Code of
Nature_; such are the doctrines, which its disciples can announce. They
are unquestionably preferable to that supernatural superstition which
never does any thing but mischief to the human species. Such is the
worship that is taught by that sacred reason, which is the object of
contempt with the theologian; which meets the insult of the fanatic;
who only estimates that which man can neither conceive nor practise; who
make his morality consist in fictitious duties; his virtue in actions
generally useless, frequently pernicious to the welfare of society; who
for want of being acquainted with nature, which is before their eyes,
believe themselves obliged to seek in ideal worlds imaginary motives, of
which every thing proves the inefficacy. The motive which the morality
of nature employs, is the self-evident interest of each individual,
of each community, of the whole human species, in all times, in every
country, under all circumstances. Its worship is the sacrifice of vice,
the practise of real virtues; its object is the conservation of the
human race, the happiness of the individual, the peace of mankind;
its recompences are affection, esteem, and glory; or in their default,
contentment of mind, with merited self-esteem, of which no power will
ever be able to deprive virtuous mortals; its punishments, are hatred,
contempt, and indignation; which society always reserves for those
who outrage its interests; from which even the most powerful can never
effectually shield themselves.

Those nations who shall be disposed to practise a morality so wise, who
shall inculcate it in infancy, whose laws shall unceasingly confirm it,
will neither have occasion for superstition, nor for chimeras. Those
who shall obstinately prefer figments to their dearest interests, will
certainly march forward to ruin. If they maintain themselves for a
season, it is because the power of nature sometimes drives them back to
reason, in despite of those prejudices which appear to lead them on to
certain destruction. Superstition, leagued with tyranny, for the waste
of the human species, are themselves frequently obliged to implore
the assistance of a reason which they contemn; of a nature which they
disdain; which they debase; which they endeavour to crush under the
ponderous bulk of artificial theories. Superstition, in all times so
fatal to mortals, when attacked by reason, assumes the sacred mantle of
public utility; rests its importance on false grounds, founds its
rights upon the indissoluble alliance which it pretends subsists between
morality and itself; notwithstanding it never ceases for a single
instant to wage against it the most cruel hostility. It is,
unquestionably, by this artifice, that it has seduced so many sages.
In the honesty of their hearts, they believe it useful to politics;
necessary to restrain the ungovernable fury of the passions; thus
hypocritical superstition, in order to mask to superficial observers,
its own hideous character, like the ass with the lion's skin, always
knows how to cover itself with the sacred armour of utility; to buckle
on the invulnerable shield of virtue; it has therefore, been believed
imperative to respect it, notwithstanding it felt awkward under these
incumbrances; it consequently has become a duty to favor imposture,
because it has artfully entrenched itself behind the altars of truth;
its ears, however, discover its worthlessness; its natural cowardice
betrays itself; it is from this intrenchment we ought to drive it; it
should be dragged forth to public view; stripped of its surreptitious
panoply; exposed in its native deformity; in order that the human race
may become acquainted with its dissimulation; that mankind may have a
knowledge of its crimes; that the universe may behold its sacrilegious
hands, armed with homicidal poniards, stained with the blood of nations,
whom it either intoxicates with its fury, or immolates without pity to
the violence of its passions.

The MORALITY OF NATURE is the only creed which her interpreter offers to
his fellow citizens; to nations; to the human species; to future races,
weaned from those prejudices which have so frequently disturbed the
felicity of their ancestors. The friend of mankind cannot be the friend
of delusion, which at all times has been a real scourge to the earth.
The APOSTLE OF NATURE will not be the instrument of deceitful chimeras,
by which this world is made only an abode of illusions; the adorer of
truth will not compromise with falsehood; he will make no covenant with
error; conscious it must always be fatal to mortals. He knows that the
happiness of the human race imperiously exacts that the dark unsteady
edifice of superstition should be razed to its foundations; in order
to elevate on its ruins a temple suitable to peace--a fane sacred to
virtue. He feels it is only by extirpating, even to the most slender
fibres, the poisonous tree, that during so many ages has overshadowed
the universe, that the inhabitants of this world will be able to use
their own optics--to bear with steadiness that light which is competent
to illumine their understanding--to guide their wayward steps--to give
the necessary ardency to their souls. If his efforts should be vain; if
he cannot inspire with courage, beings too much accustomed to tremble;
he will, at least, applaud himself for having dared the attempt.
Nevertheless, he will not judge his exertions fruitless, if he has
only been enabled to make a single mortal happy: if his principles have
calmed the conflicting transports of one honest soul; if his reasonings
have cheered up some few virtuous hearts. At least he will have the
advantage of having banished from his own mind the importunate terror
of superstition; of having expelled from his own heart the gall which
exasperates zeal; of having trodden under foot those chimeras with which
the uninformed are tormented. Thus, escaped from the peril of the storm,
he will calmly contemplate from the summit of his rock, those tremendous
hurricanes which superstition excites; he will hold forth a succouring
hand to those who shall be willing to accept it; he will encourage them
with his voice; he will second them with his best exertions, and in the
warmth of his own compassionate heart, he will exclaim:

O NATURE; sovereign of all beings! and ye, her adorable daughters,
VIRTUE, REASON, and TRUTH! remain for ever our revered protectors: it is
to you that belong the praises of the human race; to you appertains the
homage of the earth. Shew, us then, O NATURE! that which man ought
to do, in order to obtain the happiness which thou makest him desire.
VIRTUE! Animate him with thy beneficent fire. REASON! Conduct his
uncertain steps through the paths of life. TRUTH! Let thy torch illumine
his intellect, dissipate the darkness of his road. Unite, O assisting
deities! your powers, in order to submit the hearts of mankind to
your dominion. Banish error from our mind; wickedness from our hearts;
confusion from our footsteps; cause knowledge to extend its salubrious
reign; goodness to occupy our souls; serenity to dwell in our bosoms.
Let imposture, confounded, never again dare to shew its head. Let our
eyes, so long, either dazzled or blindfolded, be at length fixed
upon those objects we ought to seek. Dispel for ever those mists
of ignorance, those hideous phantoms, together with those seducing
chimeras, which only serve to lead us astray. Extricate us from that
dark abyss into which we are plunged by superstition; overthrow the
fatal empire of delusion; crumble the throne of falsehood; wrest from
their polluted hands the power they have usurped. Command men, without
sharing your authority with mortals: break the chains that bind them
down in slavery: tear away the bandeau by which they are hoodwinked;
allay the fury that intoxicates them; break in the hands of sanguinary,
lawless tyrants, that iron sceptre with which they are crushed to
exile; the imaginary regions, from whence fear has imported them, those
theories by which they are afflicted. Inspire the intelligent being with
courage; infuse energy into his system, that, at length, he may feel his
own dignity; that he may dare to love himself; to esteem his own actions
when they are worthy; that a slave only to your eternal laws, he may no
longer fear to enfranchise himself from all other trammels; that blest
with freedom, he may have the wisdom to cherish his fellow creature; and
become happy by learning to perfection his own condition; instruct him
in the great lesson, that the high road to felicity, is prudently to
partake himself, and also to cause others to enjoy, the rich banquet
which thou, O Nature! hast so bountifully set before him. Console thy
children for those sorrows to which their destiny submits them, by
those pleasures which wisdom allows them to partake; teach them to be
contented with their condition; to banish envy from their mind; to yield
silently to necessity. Conduct them without alarm to that period which
all beings must find; _let them learn that time changes all things, that
consequently they are made neither to avoid its scythe nor to fear its
arrival._





[TRANSLATOR'S APPENDIX]

A BRIEF SKETCH

OF THE

LIFE AND WRITINGS

OF

M. DE. MIRABAUD.


At a time when we are on the eve of an important change in our
political affairs, which must evidently lead either to the recovery and
re-establishment of our liberties, or to a military despotism, those who
are connected with the press ought to use every exertion to enlighten
their fellow-citizens, and to assert their right of canvassing, in the
most free and unrestrained manner, every subject connected with the
happiness of man.

The priesthood have ever been convenient tools in the hands of
tyrants, to keep the bulk of the people in a degraded servility. By the
superstitious and slavish doctrines which they infuse into their minds,
they prevent them from thinking for themselves and asserting their own
independence. At a moment when national schools are erecting in every
quarter of the country, not with a sincere desire of enlightening the
rising generation, but with the insidious design of instilling into
their minds the doctrines of "Church and King," in order to bolster up
a little longer the present rotten, tottering, and corrupt system: at
a moment, too, when thousands of fanatic preachers are traversing the
country, with a view to subjugate the human mind to the baleful empire
of visonary enthusiasm and sectarian bigotry to the utter extinction
of every noble, manly, liberal, and pilanthropic principle;--at such a
moment as this, we thought that the "SYSTEM OF NATURE" could not fail
to render essential service to the cause both of civil and religious
liberty. No work, ancient or modern, has surpassed it, in the eloquence
and sublimity of its language, or in the facility with which it treats
the most abtruse and difficult subjects. It is, without exception, the
boldest effort the human mind has yet produced, in the investigation
of morals and theology--in the destruction of priestcraft and
superstition--and in developing the sources of all those passions and
prejudices which have proved so fatal to the tranquillity of the world.

The republic of letters has never produced an author whose pen was so
well calculated to emancipate mankind from all those trammels with which
the nurse, the schoolmaster and the priest have successively locked
up their noblest faculties, before they were capable of reasoning and
judging for themselves. The frightful apprehensions of the gloomy
bigot, and all the appalling terrors of superstition, are here utterly
annihilated, to the complete satisfaction of every unbiassed and
impartial person.--These we considered as necessary observations to
make, previous to any attempt at the biography of the author.

Biography may be reckoned among the most interesting of literary
productions. Its intrinsic value is such, that, though capable of
extraordinary embellishment from the hand of genius, yet no inferiority
of execution can so degrade it, as to deprive it of utility. Whatever
relates even to man in general, considered only as an aggregate of
active and intelligent beings, has a strong claim upon our notice; but
that which relates to our author, as distinguished from the rest of his
species, moving in a more exalted sphere, and towering above them by
the resplendent excellencies of his mind, seems to me to be peculiarly
calculated for our contemplation, and ought to form the highest pleasure
of our lives. There is a principle of curiosity implanted in us, which
leads us, in an especial manner, to investigate our fellow creatures;
the eager inquisitiveness with which the mechanic seeks to know the
history of his fellow-workmen and the ardour with which the philosopher,
the poet, or the historian hunts for details that may familiarize
him with, a Descartes or a Newton, with a Milton, a Hume, or a
Gibbon--spring from the same source. Their object, however, may
perhaps vary; for, in the former, it may be for the sake of detraction,
invidious cavil, or malice; in the latter, it is a sweet homage paid by
the human heart to the memory of departed genius.

It has been repeatedly observed that the life of a scholar affords few
materials for biography. This is only negatively true;--could every
scholar have a Boswell, the remark would vanish; or were every scholar
a Rousseau, a Gibbon, or a Cumberland it would be equally nugatory.
What can present higher objects of contemplation--what can claim
more forcibly our attention--where can we seek for subjects of a more
precious nature, than in the elucidation of the operations of mind,
the acquisition of knowledge, the gradual expansion of genius; its
application, its felicities, its sorrows, its wreaths of fame, its cold,
undeserved neglect? Such scenes, painted by, the artist himself, are a
rich bequest to mankind: even when traced by the hand of friendship
or the pencil of admiration, they possess a permanent interest in our
hearts. I cannot conceive a life more worthy of public notice, more
important, more interesting to human nature, than the life of a literary
man, were it executed according to the ideas I have formed of it: did
it exhibit a faithful delineation of the progress of intellect, from the
cradle upwards; did it portray, in accurate colors, the production of
what we call genius: by what accident it was first awakened; what were
its first tendencies; how directed to a particular object; by what means
it was nourished and unfolded; the gradual progress of its operation
in the production of a work; its hopes and fears; its delights; its
miseries; its inspirations; and all the thousand fleeting joys that so
often invest its path but for a moment, and then fade like the dews
of the morning. Let it contain too a transcript of the many nameless
transports that float round the heart, that dance in the gay circle
before the ardent gazing eye, when the first conception of some future
effort strikes the mind; how it pictures undefined delights of fame and
popular applause; how it anticipates the bright moments of invention,
and dwells with prophetic ecstasy on the felicitous execution of
particular parts, that already start into existence by the magic touch
of a heated imagination. Let it depict the tender feelings of solitude,
the breathings of midnight silence, the scenes of mimic life, of imaged
trial, that often occupy the musing mind; let it be such a work, so
drawn, so coloured, and who shall pronounce it inferior? Who rather
will not confess that it presents a picture of human nature, where every
heart may find some corresponding harmony? When, therefore, it is said,
that the life of a scholar is barren, it is so only because it has never
been properly delineated; because those parts only have been selected
which are common, and fail to distinguish him from the common man;
because we have never penetrated into his closet, or into his heart;
because we have drawn him only as an outward figure, and left unnoticed
that internal structure that would delight, astonish, and improve. And
then, when we compare the life of such a man with the more active one
of a soldier, a statesman, or a lawyer, we pronounce it insipid,
uninteresting. True;--the man of study has not fought for hire--he has
not slaughtered at the command of a master: he would disdain to do
so. Though unaccompanied with the glaring actions of public men, which
confound and dazzle by their publicity, but shrink from the estimation
of moral truth, it would present a far nobler picture; yes, and a more
instructive one:--the calm disciple of reason meditates in silence; he
walks his road with innoxious humility; he is poor, but his mind is his
treasure; he cultivates his reason, and she lifts him to the pinnacle of
truth; he learns to tear away the veil of self-love, folly, pride, and
prejudice, and bares the human heart to his inspection; he corrects and
amends; he repairs the breaches made by passion; the proud man passes
him by, and looks upon him with scorn; but he feels his own worth, that
ennobling consciousness which swells in every vein, and inspires him
with true pride--with manly independence: to such a man I could sooner
bow in reverence, than to the haughtiest, most successful candidate for
the world's ambition. But of such men, for the reason I have already
mentioned, our information is scanty. While of others, who have
commanded a greater share of public notoriety, venal or mistaken
admiration has given more than we wished to know. Among these respected
individuals of human nature, may be placed Mirabaud. Had Mirabaud been
an Englishman, who doubts but that we should have possessed at least
ample details of the usual subjects of biographical notice; while all
that has been collected among his own countrymen, is a scanty memoir in
a common dictionary. That we are doomed to remain ignorant of the life
of such men, speaks a loud disgrace.--I lament it.

JOHN BAPTISTE MIRABAUD, was born at Paris in the year 1674. He
prosecuted his infantile studies under the direction of his parents, and
was afterwards entered a member of the _Congregation of the Priests of
the Oratory_, where he passed several years, and produced some very bold
writings, which were never intended for publication.

He was subsequently appointed tutor to the princesses of the House of
Orleans, and then took the resolution of destroying the greater part of
the manuscripts that he produced while a member of the _Congregation_;
but the treachery of some of his friends, to whom he had confided his
manuscripts, rendered this precaution useless, for some of his works
were published during the time he remained the preceptor to his royal
pupils; among which number may be reckoned his "New Liberties of
Thought," a work but little calculated for gaining him friends in the
purlieus of the Court of Orleans. The "Origin and Antiquity of the
World," in three parts, was also published at this period, and from the
publication of this work, may be dated the resolution of M. de Mirabaud
to quit his office of preceptor, which he relinquished, having become
more independent; he now gave himself up entirely to his philosophical
studies, and produced the "System of Nature," with which he was assisted
by Diderot, D'Alembert, Baron D'Olbac, and others.

The profound metaphysical knowledge displayed throughout the System
of Nature, and the doctrines which are therein advanced, warrants the
conclusion, that it is at once the most decisive, boldest, and most
extraordinary work, that the human understanding ever had the courage to
produce. The study of metaphysics his generally been considered the most
terrific to the indolent mind; but the clear and perspicuous reasoning
of a Mirabaud, who has united the most profound argument, with the most
fascinating eloquence, charm and instruct us at the same time. But it
was not, to be expected that such doctrines as are contained in the
System of Nature, would be advanced without meeting with some opposition
from the superficial and bigoted metaphysicians, who feel an interest
in upholding a system of delusion and superstition. No! certainly not,
Their interest was threatened, and their _craft_ in danger, and the
consequence was, that the _Atheist_ or _Disciple of Nature_, has
been abused with every scurrilous epithet, "full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

Atheism is stigmatized with having "opened a wide door for libertinism,
destroying the social and moral compact; and striking a deadly blow
at religion. It is asserted that the atheist, who by his opinions has
deprived himself of the hope and consolation of a future life, has no
motive for the practise of virtue, or to contribute to the well being of
society. Deprived of a chimera which religion every where presents him,
he wanders through the cheerless gloom of scepticism, regardless of the
consequences of an abandoned life. Without a God, he acknowledges no
benefactor; without divine laws, he knows no rule for the conduct of
life, and submits to no law but his passions. An enemy to all social
order, he spurns at human laws, and breaks through every barrier opposed
to his wickedness." Under such colours is an atheist painted: a short
digression must be suffered to examine this picture, and to disprove the
assertions so sweepingly made.

I admit that atheism strikes a deadly blow at religion; because under
the cloak of religion, mankind have been oppressed in all ages; but that
it encourages libertinism, or destroys the "social and moral compact," I
have yet to learn. In all organized governments, men are restrained from
crime and compelled to submission by laws supposed to be made for the
general benefit. These laws are the effect of the first formation of
society for mutual preservation. Here then is a sufficient motive
for the one as well as the other, to contribute to the well-being of
society. The laws of Nature are the same in effect on the atheist
and the religionist. If man be led captive by his passions, and gives
himself to debauchery and voluptuousness, nature will punish him with
bodily infirmities and a debilitated mind. If he be intemperate, she
will shorten his days and bring him to the grave with the most poignant
remorse. The fatal effects of his vicious propensities will fall upon
his own head. A disturber of social order will live in continual fear
of the vengeance of society, and that very fear is a more dreadful
punishment than the just vengeance which perhaps he escapes. It renders
life burdensome, and makes a man hateful to himself. Can men have
stronger motives for the practise of virtue? The atheist is in full
possession of these motives, and the religionist is most completely
swayed by them, whatever may be his pretensions to others derived
from religion. But we are assured he has other motives; more powerful
incentives, in the promise of future rewards and punishments. This, like
all other chimerical doctrines, cannot be maintained if we look at the
general practise of mankind. Let us trace the effects of this doctrine,
or rather let us examine the actions, conduct, and character of men
professing it, and we shall see how little influence it has over them.
The bulk of society believe they shall answer in a future life for the
deeds done in the present. Nay, I hardly think one in a hundred thousand
will say they doubt it. What then is its effect? With this dreadful
sentence, _"Thou shalt go into everlasting punishment,"_ continually
sounded in their ears, do we not daily see the greatest enormities
committed? Are not the most horrid crimes perpetrated in all parts
of the world? The most vicious propensities and the most extravagant
follies are almost indiscriminately gratified. Is not vice frequently
triumphant, and virtue compelled to seek her own reward in retirement?
The laws of society are broken by the most flagrant injustice, and the
laws of nature outraged by the most shocking depravity. All this evil
exists in nations believing themselves to be accountable beings after
death. Where then are the beneficial effects arising, to mankind from
the promulgation of this doctrine? Men who cannot be restrained from
doing evil by human laws, have no dread of any other. Their whole lives
and conduct confirm this. Others who live in submission to the laws of
society, give themselves up to those vicious habits, (without fear of
divine laws) which the law does not take cognizance of. Men, not wholly
depraved, or not without the pale of society, generally respect the
laws, and fear the bad opinion of others. Hence we observe, when
interest or passion leads them into secret vices, they invariably play
the hypocrite; and although they are aware of the denunciations of their
God, whom they acknowledge is a witness to all their actions, while they
preserve their fair fame they still persevere. In fact, they live as if
they disbelieved in his existence; and yet the greatest criminal, the
most depraved wretch, would shudder at being told there is no God. The
atheist, as a man, is liable to commit the same crimes, and fall into
the same vices as the believer; but because he is an atheist, is he a
worse criminal than the other? In one respect, I conceive he is not so
bad. He only acts in defiance of _human_ laws,--he only offends men; the
other infringes _both divine_ and _human_;--he defies both God and man.
Both are injurious to society and themselves, and both are actuated by
the came motives.

Again we are told, that the well disposed part of mankind are rendered
more virtuous, and the vicious less vicious by this doctrine. How are
we to know that? If the virtuous man acts uprightly, does good to his
fellow creatures, restrains his passions, and returns good for evil,
experience teaches him it is his interest so to do. Those who are
viciously disposed are only deterred from crime by penal laws. Societies
cannot long exist, where evil has the ascendency. Without social
laws, this would really be the case, notwithstanding the threats of an
avenging God. If men were told they would not be answerable for the evil
committed in this life to human laws, but that God would punish them
after death, it is evident the human race would soon be exterminated.
On the other hand, tell them their crimes will never be punished by God,
or, in other words, there is no other God than NATURE, but that the laws
of men will avenge the offences against society; so long as those
laws are administered with justice and impartiality, so long will such
society continue to improve. Hence it is evident that the system which
will maintain order in society by itself, must be the best and most
rational. A good government without religion would be more solid and
lasting, and tend more to the preservation of mankind, than all the
theocratical or ecclesiastical governments that ever the world was
subject to.--Thus much for the opponents of atheism.

It has been asserted with a perverse obstinacy, by the advocates for the
existence of a deity, that the SYSTEM OF NATURE was never written by
the author whose name it bears.--It is granted that it was not published
during his life: but that circumstance forms no reason why such a
conclusion should be drawn. The persecutions which the atheists have
endured, were a sufficient excuse for the work not appearing in any form
during the life time of its venerable author. The Athenians sought to
try Diagoras the Melian, for atheism; but he fled from Athens, and a
price was offered for his head. Protagoras was banished from Athens, and
his books burnt, because he ventured to assert, that he knew nothing of
the gods. Stephen Dolet was burnt at Paris for atheism. Giordano Bruno
was burnt by the Inquisitors in Italy. Lucilio Vanini was burnt at
Thoulouse, through the kind offices of an Attorney-General. Bayle
was under the necessity of fleeing to Holland. Casimio Liszynski was
executed at Grodno;--and Akenhead at Edinborough. And the body of the
eloquent and erudite Hume, was obliged to be watched many nights by his
friends, lest it should be taken up by the fanatics, who considered him
one of the greatest monsters of iniquity, because he did not happen to
believe as they believed.--With these pictures of Christian persecution
before his eyes, is it surprising that M. de Mirabaud should adopt the
resolution of suffering the SYSTEM OF NATURE to appear as a posthumous
work? That the same fate would have attended him, the most devout
Christian will not undertake to deny.

However the sentiments of M. de Mirabaud may be condemned by the
fanatics, all those who knew him bear the most brilliant testimony of
his integrity, candour, and the soundness of his understanding; in a
word, to his social virtues, and the innocence of his manners. He died
universally regretted, at Paris, the twenty-fourth of June, 1760, in the
eighty-sixth year of his age.

The following works, written by him at different periods, were never
published:--_The Life of Jesus Christ. Impartial Reflections on the
Gospel. The Morality of Nature. An Abridged History of the Priesthood;
Ancient and Modern. The Opinions of the Ancients concerning the Jews._ A
wretched mutilated edition of this last work was published at Amsterdam,
in 1740, in two small volumes, under the title of _Miscellaneous
Dissertations_.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

        by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
018:014 Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here];
        and he will kill me.
018:015 Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
        I will surely show myself to him today.
018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went
        to meet Elijah.
018:017 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,
        Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
018:018 He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your
        father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments
        of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel,
        and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets
        of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
018:020 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered
        the prophets together to Mount Carmel.
018:021 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you
        waver between the two sides?  If Yahweh is God, follow him;
        but if Baal, then follow him."  The people answered him
        not a word.
018:022 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet
        of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty men.
018:023 Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose ectronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

"Nothing there evidently," Colonel Welsh eventually broke the silence.
"Perhaps it was just a falling star, but I never saw a star fall _up_."

"Maybe it was some of that Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said with a
chuckle. "I never heard of it being seen in this part of the country,
though."

"Saint _what_?" Freddy Farmer echoed. "What in the world are you
talking about? And what is it?"

"Saint Elmo's Fire," Dave said. "Didn't you ever hear of it, Freddy?"

"Would I be asking, if I had?" the English youth snapped. "Go on. Stop
waiting to be encouraged to show all your knowledge. Just what is Saint
Elmo's Fire?"

"Well, I can't give you a scientific answer to that one," Dave said.
"But Saint Elmo's Fire is the name given to globular electric light
often seen on the spars and rigging of ships at sea during a storm.
And of recent years it has been seen on the wing tips of airplanes
flying through electrically charged air. Frankly, I've never seen any
of the stuff in my life. But I knew a pilot once who used to fly over
the Andes in South America, and he said they used to see it often.
Little bright balls of fire that seemed to roll right along the leading
edges of the wing, and then disappear just when you thought they were
going to bump into the gas tanks, or something. The first few times he
witnessed such a display he lost a dozen years off his life. He said,
though, that after a while he got used to it--even looked forward to
it every time he took off."

"You're pulling my leg!" Freddy snorted.

"No, Farmer, that's true," Colonel Welsh said. "I've seen some Saint
Elmo's Fire myself. And I can tell you that it scares the pants off you
the first time you see it. Ever fly through a thunder storm, and see
lightning playing around your wing tips?"

"Yes, I've seen that," Freddy admitted. "And I was sure I'd never live
to land safely on the ground again."

"Well, then, you know how it feels to see Saint Elmo's Fire," the
Colonel chuckled. "Only I think the Saint Elmo stuff gives you a worse
scare when you see it actually come rolling along the wing toward you.
But that light I saw just now wasn't shaped like a ball. More like a
streak, or like the powdered tail of a comet. It was strung out in a--"

If Colonel Welsh finished the sentence, nobody heard it. At that moment
the night skies shook and trembled with the savage yammer of aerial
machine gun fire. And the cabin window not eighteen inches in front of
Dave's eyes seemed to crack in a trillion places and then melt away
into oblivion.

"My word!" Colonel Welsh cried. "What was that?"

Dave didn't bother to answer for a second or so. His heart had zoomed
up his throat to jam hard against his back teeth, and his eyes had
bulged out of their sockets like marbles on sticks. Instinct took split
second charge of his movements, however, and almost before he realized
what he was doing he had booted the Lockheed up over on left wing tip
and was slicing down through the air. At practically the same instant
he whipped out his free hand and switched off the navigation lights.
Then as the craft went slicing down through the night sky, he dragged
air into his aching lungs.

"Those were aerial machine guns!" he cried. "And whoever was working
them was in earnest. Look at that window! Just a shade improvement on
his aim and it would have been curtains for the three of us."

As the last left Dave's lips, he pulled the plane out of its wild
sideslip and went curving up and around to the left.

"Aerial machine guns?" Colonel Welsh echoed in blank amazement. "You're
crazy, Dawson!"

"Could be, and maybe!" Dave snapped. "But I've heard those sky
choppers often enough to recognize them every time. And do you think an
eagle or something flew into that window, sir?"

"No, of course not," the Intelligence chief grunted. "Sorry I sounded
off. You're right, of course. But it doesn't make sense. Who the devil
would want to take a crack at us?"

Dave shrugged in the darkness, and for a moment or so as the plane
roared heavenward he strained his eyes for a glimpse of some other
shadow cutting about in the air. He saw nothing, however, and then
turned his head and spoke back over his shoulder.

"Maybe not _us_, sir," he said, "but I guess the Axis would be pretty
tickled to see _you_ put out of circulation. If you want my guess, some
rat saw you take off with us. Maybe he used a hidden radio and sent
word ahead. This mountainous country is a swell place to hide a plane,
you know, sir."

"And those _were_ exhaust plumes you saw!" Freddy Farmer cried. "The
lad was probably climbing up to get around in back when you saw his
exhaust plumes. Well, let the beggar come again. We'll--Good grief!
This plane isn't armed!"

"No," Colonel Welsh said in a slightly hollow voice. "Guess they never
figured it was necessary to arm these utility planes used to transport
personnel about the country."

"If only the chaps in high places would stop _figuring_ so much in this
war!" Dave groaned.

"Quite!" Freddy Farmer echoed the truth bitterly. "But bemoaning the
lack of common sense in the average High Command won't help us now. If
the blighter comes back for another fling, Dave, you'll just have to--"

"Don't bother telling me!" Dave shouted. "Here he comes--from the left
and up! Hang onto your seats!"

The last had hardly left Dave's lips before he was hauling the Lockheed
straight up on its tail. Before the plane reached stalling speed,
however, he kicked it over on wing and then sent it dropping nose first
toward the black carpet below that was the ground. No sooner had he
kicked the plane over on wing than he switched off both engines, and
shoved the compensator throttle open wide, so that no carbon sparks or
exhaust light of any kind would etch their path downward through the
night.

Meanwhile the mysterious attacker had opened fire again, but Dave's
quick action at the controls caused the unknown killer to miss by a
wide margin. The flickering ribbon of tracers didn't even come close.
And at the end of another three or four seconds the Lockheed was well
on its way earthward and out of sight.

"See that bird as he banged on by us?" Dave cried, when he was able to
talk again. "It looked to me like a small Beechcraft. Or maybe it was a
Waco. But he's carrying two guns--and he wants us mighty badly. Heck,
if there were only guns aboard this crate. I had a beautiful broadside
bead on him."

"Yes, I saw his silhouette as he tore by," Freddy said through clenched
teeth. "But I didn't recognize his type. I don't know the Yank planes
very well, though. But I say, Dave! Watch our altitude, you know!"

"You're telling me!" Dave grunted. "I'm watching it plenty, and
praying, too. There must be some of those mountains under us by now.
I think we've got a couple of thousand feet to play around in, but no
more than that. I'm flat gliding her as much as I can, but keep those
eagle X-ray eyes of yours on the job, Freddy. And yell if you see a
mountain peak looming up."

"Mountain peak!" Colonel Welsh cried excitedly. "For pity's sake, keep
above them, Dawson. Start those engines and get us some altitude!"

"That would be risking more than this glide, sir," Dave told him.
"That bird up there has been spotting us by our exhaust plumes, and
aiming blindly. So long as we show no light at all he stands to lose us
completely. But if we open up the engines and show exhaust light he's
going to be able to take another crack. And--well, third time never
fails, you know, and stuff. Our best bet is to try and lose him before
we get too low. He has a ship that can travel, but if we get a little
lead on him we'll be all right."

"But remember all those mountain peaks down there!" the Intelligence
chief persisted. "One thing this plane has got is parachutes. Perhaps
we'd better bail out and let the blasted ship crash. At least we'd save
our own necks."

"Not me!" Dave barked without thinking. "Go ahead and bail out if
you want to. You, too, Freddy. But I'm sticking with this ship if
I possibly can. I don't want to see her bust up, if I can help it.
Anyway, I'm going to give her all the breaks she's got coming."

"And of course I'm staying with you," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "I'm
a blasted fool to put my precious neck in your hands. But there you
are, anyway."

"No wonder you two are famous for pulling miracles out of a hat!"
Colonel Welsh growled. Then after a short pause: "Very well! If Farmer
trusts you that much, I suppose I might as well. But if you have to hit
a mountain, for pity's sake try and pick out a soft one. I bruise very
easily!"




CHAPTER SEVEN

_Pilot's Luck_


Dave chuckled as the Colonel's remark came to his ears, but his heart
pounded a little harder and the warm glow of pride rippled through his
veins.

"Thanks, sir," he said. "And sorry that I exploded that way. But don't
worry, I'll get us out of this little jam if it's the last thing I do."

"Well, see that it _isn't_, my good man!" Freddy Farmer grunted.

For the next few moments nobody said a word. All three of them leaned
forward in their seats and strained their eyes at the darkness ahead
and below. Dave's hands felt cold and clammy, and he could feel the
little drops of sweat ooze out on his forehead and trickle down his
face. For the last fifteen seconds or so he had spotted what he
believed to be a mountain peak just ahead, and not more than a hundred
feet below. He didn't say a word to the others. He kept his mouth shut
and eased the plane a little to the left so as to be able to pass on
by the peak with enough free air to spare between his right wing tip
and the unseen trees or jagged rocks he knew must dot all sides of
that peak. Once past it, he could start the engines again and climb
for altitude. It was a cinch that the unknown attacker was cutting
about in the black sky somewhere far behind him. But once he got beyond
that peak he felt that his lead would be great enough for him to risk
showing his exhaust plumes. As a matter of fact, though, it was quite
possible that the unknown attacker was miles and miles behind. It was
possible that the man had cut around to the east, believing that Dave
wouldn't dare chance holding his westerly course with the mountains so
close.

"Yeah, maybe!" he murmured. "But I'm going to make sure just the same!"

"What did you say, Dave?" Freddy Farmer cried out in a voice of alarm.

"I didn't say a thing," Dave grunted, and tightened his hold on the
controls. "Just thinking a little out loud. Shut up, little man, or
you'll make me rock the boat."

Freddy Farmer caught his breath as though he were about to speak.
Instead, though, he said nothing. He simply leaned farther forward
in his seat. Dave caught the movement out the corner of his eye,
and grinned, tight-lipped. Freddy had sighted the mountain peak, but
realized that he had seen it and was trying to slide by on the left. So
the English youth had snapped his lips shut so as not to give Colonel
Welsh a slight case of heart failure. Good old Freddy. Always knew when
to open his mouth, and when to keep mum.

Perhaps it was six seconds, but it seemed like six thousand years to
Dave before the slightly darker shadow that was the mountain peak slid
past the tip of the right wing and disappeared behind. The instant it
was gone from view he whipped on the switches, caught both engines,
and fed them high test gas at full throttle. The roar of the engines
breaking into life was a sound akin to worlds crashing into each other.
Yet at the same time it was a welcome sound to Dave's ears, and to
Freddy Farmer's too. But what filled their hearts with an even greater
happiness was the Lockheed climbing upward to a safe altitude above the
mountain range. The instant he was well clear, Dave swung the plane
onto its westerly course again, and relaxed in the seat.

"Top-hole, Dave," Freddy Farmer said quietly. "A very pukka bit of
flying, that."

"Thanks," Dave replied. "We got away with it okay. But I'd hate like
heck to have to do it every day. You spotted that mountain peak, didn't
you?"

"Quite," the English youth murmured. "But I thought it best to keep my
mouth shut. Realized that you knew what you were doing. And besides, no
sense in--"

"No sense in giving this old dodo grey hairs, eh?" Colonel Welsh spoke
up with a chuckle. "Well, it was nice of both of you, but I saw it,
too. The only reason _I_ didn't speak, though, was because my tongue
was frozen stiff. As you say, Dawson, I'd hate to have that sort of
thing for a daily diet. Very sweet flying, though, very sweet."

"We could have made it sweeter if this plane had been armed," Dave
grunted, and stared at the black sky ahead. "That tramp certainly had
his nerve jumping on us. Wonder who the heck he could be. Sure you
haven't any ideas, Colonel?"

There was a long minute of silence while the senior officer seemed to
make up his mind.

"No, I'm afraid I haven't," he finally said slowly. "As you mentioned
awhile back, there are probably plenty of birds who would like to see
me out of the way. Somehow, though, I can't see them going about it in
this manner. Their style is more along the line of pot shots from dark
doorways. Or a bomb in my car, or tossed through my window. Frankly, I
can't make head nor tail of this business tonight."

"Many chaps know you were headed west, sir?" Freddy Farmer asked
quietly.

"What do you mean, many?" the Colonel replied sharply. "Did I broadcast
it, you mean?"

"Hardly that, sir," Freddy chuckled. "I mean, did you tell many people
that you were making this trip? Not that any of them are in the pay
of Tokio or Berlin, sir, but it's possible that one of them might
innocently enough mention the fact to somebody who was. You understand
what I mean, sir?"

There was another moment of silence while the chief of U. S.
Intelligence thought things over.

"I see what you mean, Farmer," he grunted presently. "No, I didn't tell
anybody who didn't have the right to know. Fact is, the only ones I
told were those three officers you met in my office. And if those three
aren't one hundred per cent Americans, then I'm Adolf Hitler in the
flesh."

"What about the other end?" Dawson asked.

"What other end?"

"San Diego," Dave said. "Is your man in charge there expecting you? Or
are you just dropping in on a surprise visit?"

"No wonder you chaps always come out on top," Colonel Welsh said in a
frank tone. "Once you get your teeth in something you keep at it until
there's nothing left. Yes, I did wire my head agent in San Diego that I
was coming west tonight. And--"

"And my first month's pay as a U. S. Naval Aviation Lieutenant says
somebody read that wire!" Dawson cut in quickly.

"Hold it!" Colonel Welsh cried, and laughed shortly. "You're flying one
wing low this time. I said in the wire that I was coming out, but I
didn't say _how_, or _what_ time I'd arrive. Afraid you're off on the
wrong scent there, Dawson."

"Maybe, maybe not," Dave said doggedly. "But that chap didn't have a
crack at us tonight just for gunnery practice. He was shooting for
keeps. He knew darn well who was in this plane--and he was out to get
us. He--"

Dave didn't finish. At that moment the right outboard engine of the
Lockheed lost revs fast and began to sputter and clatter. Dave snapped
his eyes at the dash dials, and sucked in his breath sharply as he saw
the oil pressure needle sliding around the face of the dial toward
the zero peg. However, even as he glanced at the needle, it stopped
swinging back and promptly climbed upward again. The engine stopped
sputtering and clattering, and once again sang its full throated song
of power.

The tiny lump of ice remained in Dave's chest, however. He glanced
sidewise at Freddy Farmer and saw the corners of the English youth's
mouth tighten a bit.

"What the devil was that?" Colonel Welsh demanded in a sharp tone.
"Something wrong with the engine?"

"Not now," Dave said with an easiness he didn't feel. "Guess it picked
up a bit of ice but got rid of it in time. Anyway, she's back where
she should be. As I was saying, that lad tonight was out for blood. So
it must follow that somebody knew where you were going, when, and how.
Don't you think so, sir?"

Dave spoke the words, but it was really just an effort to keep the
conversation going. The lump of ice in his chest was hurting him
again, and he was feeling far from calm and collected. The way the
oil pressure of the right outboard engine had dropped told him that
there was trouble ahead. Many people claim that the carburetor is the
heart of an engine, and probably it is, if you want to look at it that
way. However, countless hours in the air had proved to Dave that your
real danger signal is when oil pressure starts dancing around. Engines
can run, often for a long, long time, when the carburetor is out of
whack and the engine is getting a bad feed. But let oil pressure go
screwy and you'll have real trouble on your hands. There are no halfway
measures about oil. It has to be right or your engine is worth no more
than its weight in junk. Gasoline is food for an engine, but oil is its
life blood. If it hasn't got the proper amount it dies, but definitely!

And so Dave spoke the words just to keep the conversation going and
fixed his eyes on the instruments pertaining to the functioning of the
right outboard engine. He hoped and prayed that the skipping had simply
been just one of those things. But in his heart there was gnawing
fear and dread. He feared that bullets from the guns of that unknown
attacker had nicked one of the oil feed lines, and that continued
vibration of the engine was slowly but surely shaking the feed line
connection loose, or at least causing it to crack and buckle slowly, so
that eventually the pressure set up in the line would be reduced to nil.

If it had been daylight, or if he had been sure of the terrain below,
he would have landed and made sure what had happened. But a landing was
too great a risk right now. His best bet was to keep going, nursing the
right outboard engine as much as he could, and hoping and praying that
it would continue to tick over and produce power.

"Yes, I guess your reasoning is sound enough," he heard the Colonel
say. "It's rather hard to believe, though. I mean, why go about it in
such a--well, in such a story book thriller style, you might say? I'm
not going to San Diego on any vital mission. Fact is, I could make this
trip tonight or next week, and it wouldn't make much difference. That's
what makes it seem so--so utterly crazy."

There was a moment of silence, and then Dave laughed a trifle
flat-toned.

"I don't mean to be conceited," he said. "But what you've just said,
sir, doesn't make me feel so good. Or maybe it should make me feel
important as heck. How about you, Freddy? Catch on?"

"I think so," the English youth replied. "But it's a bit--er,
fantastic, you know. However, I would feel a bit better if we had been
able to shoot the beggar down. Always did say night attacks weren't
quite the sporting thing, you know."

"Not the sporting thing, huh?" Dave echoed with a snort. "Pal, that's
only putting it by half. In my book they're plain murder."

"Of course, I'm only the passenger," Colonel Welsh spoke up sharply.
"So don't mind me. However, I would like very much to know what the
devil you two are jabbering about. What's it all about, anyway?"

"You tell him, Freddy," Dave said. "I--I feel too modest."

"Rubbish!" the English youth snapped. "You couldn't be if you tried.
Besides, you brought it up."

"Listen, you lads!" the chief of U. S. Intelligence boomed in
exasperation. "Have I got to use my authority as a Colonel? What in
blue blazes are you two talking about?"

"The fantastic, sir," Dave said with a chuckle. "Yet, on the other
hand, possibly the truth. Maybe the pilot of that plane didn't want
_Farmer and me to go aboard the Carrier Indian_."

Colonel Welsh made a hissing sound as he sucked in his breath sharply.

"Great guns!" he gasped. And then in the same breath: "But that _is_
impossible. Not even my three closest assistants knew that was to
happen until I informed you. And we went from my office straight to
Alexandria Field. No, you must be wrong, Dawson. Captains Lamb and
Stacey, and Lieutenant Caldwell, wouldn't breath a word of that even
though a gun were held at their hearts. That _is_ fantastic!"

The two boys looked crestfallen.

"See, Freddy?" Dave cried, and jabbed an elbow in his pal's ribs. "You
get the screwiest ideas. I never--!"

"None of that, funny boy!" the English youth barked back at him. "No,
you don't, not by a jugful. You brought it up. I simply agreed with
you, to be polite. You're quite right, Colonel. It's ridiculous. But
when you get to know Dawson better, you'll understand how he's--"

The rest of what Freddy Farmer would have said to the Colonel stuck
fast when only halfway up his throat. The right outboard engine
had started kicking up again, but this time it was really doing it
in earnest. The oil pressure needle went around to the zero peg in
a single jump. And even as Dave grabbed for the throttle, the right
outboard engine let out a grinding scream as though it were actually
something human, and in mortal pain. It had run dry and was seizing
up. Almost at the same instant, and as though in sympathy for its
mechanical brother, the left outboard engine started falling off in
revs at an alarming rate. Dave killed the right engine completely,
shoved hard on the left rudder to check the plane yawing, and
concentrated on keeping the left outboard engines alive as long as
possible.

"That tears it!" he said between clenched teeth. "I was afraid that
right engine had been nicked. Getting ready to drop a couple of those
landing flares, Freddy. At least we can take a look at what it's like
below."

"Take a look?" Colonel Welsh cried sharply. "You don't have to, boy!
There are mountains down there. Get us as high as you can, and then
we'll all bail out."

A hot wave of anger swept through Dawson, but he was able to choke the
words back in time. Instead he turned to Freddy Farmer and nodded.

"Let a couple go, Freddy," he said quietly. "We're only losing a foot
or two of altitude. We'll take a look _first_!"




CHAPTER EIGHT

_Nobody's Airport_


Freddy Farmer didn't bother acknowledging the request by word of mouth.
He simply nodded, and reached out his hand and jerked the little handle
that released landing flares fitted into the wing tips. There were a
few seconds more of silence; then a great silver-white light came into
being below, and spread swiftly outward toward the four points of the
compass.

Fighting the tendency of the Lockheed to yaw toward the dead engine
side, and struggling to keep the left outboard engine turning over,
Dave leaned over close to the shattered window and peered down into the
sea of silver-white light below. For a couple of seconds he couldn't
see anything but eye-dazzling light. Then as the flares dropped astern,
he was able to get a good look at the type of terrain below.

What he saw didn't exactly cause his chilled heart to warm up and loop
over with joy. True, they had safely crossed over the highest peaks of
that part of the mountain range. Below, though, were the tree-covered
foothills, cut by deep jagged stone sided ravines, and narrow plateau
formations of ground that would be hard for even a crow to alight on.

"It's no go, Dawson!" Colonel Welsh's voice suddenly broke the tingling
silence that had settled over the trio. "I know what's in your mind,
but our safest bet is for all three of us to jump. We've still got
three or four thousand feet of clearance. I think we should jump."

"I don't, not yet," Dave said bluntly, and raked the terrain below with
his eyes. "I think we should hang on a bit longer, and try to pick out
some spot big enough to slip into. This is wild country here, Colonel.
If we bail out we'll lose contact with each other, and all three of us
get lost. Let's look hard, first. I can keep her up a big longer. That
left outboard hasn't quit cold yet. And we're not losing altitude too
fast."

"All right," Colonel Welsh said grimly, and leaned forward the better
to study the flare-lighted ground below. "Confound that rat! I'd give a
lot to have his neck between my two hands right now!"

"I can think of things to do to him, myself," Dave grunted. Then, out
of the corner of his mouth: "Work those eagle eyes hard, Freddy. This
is where you should star. You always do see things first. Hurry up and
find Papa a place big enough to set us down in."

"Shut up and tend to your flying!" the English youth growled. "You
dropped our nose two feet while you were talking. Want to power dive
us in, or something? You--hold it, Dave! Bear right a bit. What's that
down there? It looks like--oh, blast it! They would, wouldn't they!"

The last was caused by the two flares finally touching ground and being
snuffed out. Quick as a flash Freddy Farmer shot out his hand and
released two more flares. The instant his eyes were again accustomed
to the bright light, Dave looked in the direction of the English
youth's pointed finger. His heart did loop with joy this time, and
he gulped with relief. What at first looked like the rock studded
side of a foothill was actually a strip of barren and seemingly level
ground between two foothills. It wasn't very big, but it seemed big
enough--unless Lady Luck deliberately turned her face the other way.

"Yeah, check, Freddy!" Dave murmured, and eased the laboring Lockheed
around and down. "That's us, that spot. Just hang on, everybody. It
won't be long now!"

"I don't like the way you say that!" Colonel Welsh said with a
mirthless laugh. "But I guess you don't mean it. Go ahead, though. I
was wrong again. We'll keep the parachutes in their packs. What a fine
night this has turned out to be!"

"Me, I'm thinking of tomorrow and next week," Dave muttered grimly as
he eased the Lockheed lower and lower, and around toward the near end
of the narrow landing space. "This is wild country here. It's plenty
wild. Right in the middle of nowhere. And this baby isn't going to do
any more flying until she has a couple of new engines stuck in her. Oh
well--"

Dave let the rest go with a shrug and hunched forward slightly over the
controls. The time for talking had passed. Now was the time for action,
and prayer. The Lockheed was down low now, too low to correct any
mistakes. The first swipe at that narrow landing space had to be good.
It had to be perfect. The jagged rocks and trees on all four sides
would make a second try impossible.

Dave's whole body felt dry as a chip, yet at the same time sweat poured
off his forehead, and the palms of his hands were clammy and cold. He
could almost feel Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh hold their breath.
As far as that went, he could almost feel the whole world stand still
and hold its breath. The dropped flares were throwing off less and less
light, but he refrained from telling Freddy to drop a couple of new
ones. Their first moment of brilliance might blind him just enough to
misjudge things by a hair. And misjudging by a hair would be more than
enough to pile them up in a heap among the trees and jagged rocks.

"Now!" he whispered softly. "Now, baby! Easy does it, now. Down you go.
Down you go. Ah-h-h...! That's the stuff!"

The Lockheed's wheels touched, touched hard, and the plane tried to
push itself off and up into the air again. But Dave had killed the
forward speed as much as he could. And after a short run forward,
and gentle but firm application of the wheel brakes by Dawson, the
twin-engined craft finally bumped to a halt not ten feet from the lip
of a sharp drop-off in the ground.

"Now I've seen everything!" Colonel Welsh fairly exploded the words.
"I've seen two miracles come to pass in the same night. It couldn't
be done, but you did it, Dawson. Congratulations from the bottom of my
heart. Good work! We really are on the ground, aren't we?"

Dave didn't bother to answer. As a matter of fact he couldn't have
said a single word at that moment even though it would have gained him
a million dollars. His heart was stuck halfway between his chest and
his throat, and refused to go up or down. It was the same with Freddy
Farmer, too. The English youth sat stiff and straight in his seat,
working his lips but making no sound. Eventually, though, he did manage
to get control of his tongue and of his frozen muscles. He reached
across and pressed Dave's arm.

"Top-hole, Dave!" he got out in a husky voice. "A bit of the very, very
best, and I mean it, really. As a pilot bloke myself, I know how good
you have to be to get away with that sort of thing. It was absolutely
perfect."

"What else?" Dave cracked back with a shaky laugh. "Look who did it!
But skip it. Is my hair grey, Freddy? Do I look very much older? I know
doggone well I gained forty years in those last couple of seconds.
Jeepers! Take a look at that drop-off ahead. Another ten feet and you
_wouldn't_ be thinking I was so hot. And I'm not, really. If Lady Luck
ever landed a plane, she did it that time, and I'm not kidding."

"Well, we're down, anyway," said Freddy. Then, getting practical: "What
do we do now? Do you know this area very well, sir? Have we got far to
go to the next village?"

Both Dave and the Colonel laughed in spite of the seriousness of the
situation. And Freddy made angry sounds in his throat.

"What's so blasted funny about that?" he demanded. "Do you plan to stay
here all night?"

"Sorry, Freddy," Dave said, and patted his pal's knee. "But this isn't
England, where you can throw a rock from one town and have it land in
the next one. This is our wild and woolly west. I don't know exactly
where we are, but I'd make a rough guess that we're a good two hundred
miles from the nearest town. And that's as the crow flies. Going over
and down these mountains and hills, you could add another two hundred
miles. What do you think, Colonel?"

"Well, not quite that far, Dawson," the senior officer said with a
laugh that was just a little too tight. "You're stretching it a little,
I'd say. Call it a hundred by air and two-fifty by foot, I guess.
We're just over the Arizona line and south of Holbrook. I'm afraid,
though, Farmer, that we will have to sit here for the rest of the
night, worse luck. To try and get out of here in the dark is just about
like deciding to step off some cliff and smash yourself to bits on the
bottom of a ravine. No. We've got to sit here until they find us."

"Hey!" Dave cried. "Aren't you forgetting something, Colonel? I mean,
who knows we're on our way? We--Oh, I see! You planned to send word
back to your office, eh? When they don't hear, they'll send planes
hunting for us, huh?"

The Colonel groaned heavily and clapped a hand to his forehead.

"You spoiled it that time, Dawson!" he muttered. "But you hit the
nail on the head. I did forget. I mean, I didn't say anything about
letting Lamb or Stacey know when I arrived at San Diego. They simply
expect to hear from me, when they hear. And my man at San Diego doesn't
actually know when I expect to arrive. This _is_ a sweet mess. I should
be demoted and kicked back into the ranks for not thinking of this
possibility. We're stuck, and no two ways about it."

"But we took this plane from the Alexandria Field," Dave said. "What
about their flight board there? Don't they list every take-off, the
pilot, and where he's heading?"

"Usually, but not in a case like this," the Colonel replied unhappily.
"When I borrow a plane, I don't tell them where I'm going. And
naturally, they don't ask me. But do we have to sit here in this
darkness, Dawson? The lights don't run off the engine, do they? How
about some light, eh?"

"Sure, sir," Dave said, and flipped up a couple of switches.

The interior of the compartment glowed with light, and the three looked
at each other. They grinned in a friendly sort of way, but neither of
them was particularly happy looking. Freddy Farmer twisted around in
his seat and looked at the Colonel.

"Then we might be here for some time, sir?" he asked.

"For several hours, at least, Farmer," the senior officer replied
gravely. "Nothing to worry about, though. As soon as it's light, we'll
build a fire and get a smoke signal in the air. A passing transport
plane may see it and come down to investigate. We're a bit south of
their regular run, though. Still, one of them may see it and get some
rescue parties sent out. Nothing to worry about."

"Not even your constant worry, pal," Dave laughed, and stuck a hand in
his tunic pocket. "Your constant worry about starving, I mean. Here's a
flock of chocolate bars I picked up at Alexandria Field before we left.
One thing I didn't tell you about Farmer, Colonel. If he can't eat
forty times a day he gets as weak as a kitten. And where he puts it,
I'll never know. Doesn't weigh more than a hundred and fifty soaking
wet. He's--"

"Some other time, my funny little man!" Freddy cut in harshly. "I
wasn't thinking about eating, if you must know the truth. Something
more serious. Or at least it will be serious if we're stuck here for a
considerable length of time."

Dave's smile faded immediately. He stared at the English youth. Colonel
Welsh also regarded him keenly.

"Okay, what?" Dave finally asked.

"The Carrier Indian," Freddy replied. Then, looking at the Colonel,
he asked, "Didn't you say that she weighs anchor sometime tomorrow
afternoon--this afternoon, really? If we're stuck here, will she sail
without us? Or has her skipper orders to wait for word from you?"

The chief of U. S. Intelligence swallowed hard and made a wry face.

"That close-shave landing!" he muttered savagely. "It still has my
brains all scrambled up. You're quite right, Farmer. What you say makes
it more of a mess than ever. The Indian is to sail whether her skipper
hears from me or not. Those two men of mine serving as machinists'
mates are already aboard. At least they were to go aboard last evening.
But she won't wait for you two. The skipper has his sailing orders, and
he'll sail whether he's shy two pilot lieutenants or not. Blast and
double blast it all! What you say, Farmer, gives me a very disquieting
thought. Perhaps I _wasn't_ the one that unknown killer was interested
in. It's quite possible that it _was_ you two. The attempt was made
to stop you from reaching the Indian before she sailed. Confound it!
If I've fumbled this thing all up, I'll go out somewhere and cut my
throat. But--but I still can't see how anybody else could possibly have
found out about this flight, let alone the real reason!"

Dave didn't say anything, but he was thinking of a case he had heard
about in England not so long ago. A bad leak had been found in the Air
Ministry Intelligence, and when it was eventually tracked to its source
it was discovered that a high official's own secretary--a supposedly
loyal Englishman who had held his post since long before the outbreak
of war--was actually in the pay of the Nazis.

"I'm wondering something, myself," he said presently. "Not to toss more
cold water on things, Colonel, but--well, you don't know for sure if
your two men went aboard the Indian last evening, do you?"

"No, not for sure," the senior officer replied with a shake of his
head. "But it's--Oh, I see what you mean. Maybe they were--er--delayed,
too, eh? You think of the nicest things, Dawson! But keep on thinking.
Don't stop. Maybe you'll think of a way to get us out of this jam in a
hurry."

"I sure wish I could!" Dave said fervently. Then, reaching out and
taking a flashlight from the instrument panel clamps, he said,
"Meantime I'm going to have a look at the engines. I could be wrong
about an oil line being nicked. It wouldn't be the first time. Maybe
it's something that we can patch up with some gum and a piece of our
shirts, and we can get ourselves out of here come daylight. That's a
hope, anyway."

Half an hour later, though, it wasn't a hope. The oil feed lines of the
right outboard engine were split and parted in three different spots.
Besides that, she was seized up tighter than a drum, and couldn't be
made to move short of using dynamite. The left outboard engine wasn't
in a much better condition. Bullets from the unknown attacker's guns
had started a bad leak in the gas line that couldn't be repaired
without the proper tools. And so at the end of the half hour Dave wiped
oil and grease from his hands and climbed down off the wing onto the
ground where Freddy Farmer and the chief of Intelligence waited.

"No soap," he said bitterly. "If that bird's job was to delay us, he
did it up brown. The only way you'll get this plane out of here is to
fly in a couple of new engines. Nothing to do but wait for daylight."

"Why wait?" Freddy Farmer protested. "Let's get a fire going now. No
telling but what it might be seen by somebody. It--I say, though! What
about your Indians? They'd give us a bit of trouble, wouldn't they?
I've heard--"

"Hold everything, pal!" Dave chuckled, while Colonel Welsh struggled
to keep a straight face. "Nowadays you only find that kind of Indians
in books, or in the movies. Let's get the fire started. It's a good
idea. And if Indians do show up I'll welcome them as the flowers in
May."

Freddy Farmer hesitated and looked hard at Dawson. After a moment or so
he shrugged.

"Very well, then," he murmured. "But I swear I don't know when to
believe you, and when not to. If I get scalped--"

"You won't!" Dave stopped him, and backed away. "Head's too hard!"

Freddy took a quick half step forward, but gave it up. Then the three
of them started collecting deadwood, and stuff from the plane that
could be used to make a good fire.




CHAPTER NINE

_Rescue Wings_


Dawn came roaring up over the mountains to the east to touch off
their peaks with fire, and send rainbows of color arcing off in all
directions. It was a sight to make a man catch his breath and stand in
awe of the glorious majesty of nature. But for Dave Dawson and Freddy
Farmer and Colonel Welsh, the coming of the new day was more than just
something beautiful to watch and admire. It was like being released
from a prison of darkness.

As soon as there was enough light to allow vision at any great
distance, they eagerly and hopefully scrutinized their immediate
surroundings. But what they saw dashed their hopes even lower.
Heart-chilling wilderness met their gaze on all sides. It was as though
they had landed at the very end of the world; landed in a little pocket
of level ground completely lost in the depths of jagged rock sided
hills and towering snow-capped mountains.

For several minutes they looked about them in silence. Then, as though
at an unspoken signal, they turned and looked at each other, each man
reading the message of utter helplessness reflected in the next man's
eyes. It was Dave who finally broke the silence, and spoke the thought
that was in the minds of the other two.

"Our smoke signal won't be seen by any plane unless it passes directly
over this spot," he said. "These hills and mountains are such that
it's as if we were at the bottom of a well. And it's going to be even
tougher getting out of here on foot."

Neither Freddy Farmer or Colonel Welsh said anything. There wasn't
anything they could say. Dave had spoken the truth. And that was that.
Eventually Colonel Welsh knocked the ashes from his dead pipe and stuck
it back in his pocket.

"We'd better not try going out on foot for a while," he said, "at least
not until tomorrow. Better to stick here today and see if anything
happens. I'm mighty sorry this happened, you fellows. It's all my
fault, and I could kick myself right up the side of that mountain."

"I wouldn't say that, sir," Freddy Farmer said with a smile. "You had
no idea that chap was going to attack us last night."

"No," the chief of U. S. Intelligence growled. "Just the same,
ignorance is no excuse. I should have made sure, just in case the
unexpected did happen. I certainly should have taken a plane fitted
with a radio, instead of this one that hasn't got any. At least we
could have let the world know that we were going down for a forced
landing. But as it turned out--"

The Colonel sighed heavily and let the rest slide. Dave and Freddy
looked at each other and shrugged. It was no use crying over spilled
milk, but as a matter of cold hard fact both of them had been just
a little surprised when they had boarded the plane and seen that it
carried no radio. Neither, though, had said anything about it.

"Why wasn't it fitted with a radio, sir?" Dave finally blurted out the
question. "I mean--well, a radio is standard equipment on any ship. Is
there no radio on this for some particular reason?"

"Yes," the senior officer replied with a wry smile, and tapped his
chest. "I'm the reason. On a couple of occasions when the plane I
was in did have a radio, I was contacted about this and that every
half hour or so. Once I even turned back because of a message I had
received, only to find I'd wasted my time. Ever since then I've flown
without a radio. Been able to get more done, too. But I certainly
struck out this time. I'm sorry."

"Well, those things happen," Dave said politely, and let the subject
drop. "How about a short scouting trip about here? Or better yet, what
say I to make the top of that mountain, there? I guess I could do it in
a couple of hours. Maybe we're not buried as deep as we think we are.
Maybe I'll see a town, or a Ranger camp from there. Also, I may find
some berries and stuff, and a spring. The chocolate we have aboard, and
the drinking water, isn't going to last us for very long. What do you
think, Colonel? Think you can keep Freddy cheered up while I'm gone?
See that the Indians don't get him?"

The Colonel grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but what he was
about to say never left his lips. At that moment all three of them
heard the faint drone of a plane somewhere up in the sky, but out of
sight behind the towering mountains north of them. As one man they spun
around and stared hard at the dawn light bouncing off the snow-capped
peaks. Nobody said a word. Nobody could. They were all too busy
holding their breath, and praying as they had never prayed before.

After a few seconds Dave snapped out of his trance, ran over to the
pile of deadwood they had collected, grabbed up an armful, ran back to
the fire and dumped his load. Then he picked up a can of oil drained
from the engine and poured it on the licking flames. A second more and
a column of oily black smoke went towering up into the dawn sky.

"He can't miss that, unless he's blind!" Dave muttered through clenched
teeth as the black smoke mounted higher and higher. "Come on, whoever
you are, take a look, take a look!"

"Steady, Dawson," Colonel Welsh cautioned gently as Dave's voice rose
to a wild shout. "We've got to steel ourselves in case he doesn't see
it. Then it won't be so tough. This thing might happen several times,
you know. No telling. Save your strength, son. Take it easy."

Dave hardly heard the words of wisdom. His eyes were glued to the
north, his ears strained to catch every beat of the plane's engine
which was still out of sight, and his two fists clenched tight as
though he were actually pulling the unseen plane closer and closer.
Then, suddenly, the drone of the engine grew louder. It rose to a
mighty roar. And then the plane came sailing into view above the
mountain peaks. It was a five-place Stinson cabin plane, a commercial
plane probably owned by some rancher. There were no markings on the
craft other than the usual Bureau of Aeronautics license letter and
number. A wild cry of joyous relief struggled up Dave's throat but was
unable to pass his lips. A riot of emotions boiled up within him, and
his lips and his tongue were suddenly too dry to form sounds. So he
simply stood stock still and grinned from ear to ear as the cabin plane
cleared the peak and then came nosing down toward them; circling down
like some giant bird seeking a spot to light on.

When it was less than five hundred feet over their heads, the three men
shook themselves loose from their paralytic spell and started jumping
around and waving their arms wildly as though the pilot of the plane
hadn't seen them yet. The pilot waggled his wings as a signal that he
had, and then leveled off and went coasting toward the eastern end
of the landing strip. There he circled back, suddenly fed hop to his
engine and started to climb. For one horrible moment Dave was afraid
the pilot had decided that he couldn't put his plane down on the small
strip. But he was wrong. The pilot had simply goosed his engine to add
enough to his speed to clear the tops of some tall trees. He slipped
over them, went up on left wing a bit, and slid down to level off in a
perfect landing.

Even as the plane was braking to a stop, Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel
rushed back to it. They pulled up to a halt, waited for the plane to
roll the last few feet, then ducked under the left wing and around to
the cabin door. They had already seen that there were two men aboard
the plane, the pilot and a passenger. As Dave watched them come back
from the pilot's nook to the cabin door, he was faintly surprised by
their looks. Why, he didn't know, but somehow he had expected to see
a couple of youngsters climb down from the plane. But they weren't
young. They were both well along in years. They had hard, rugged faces,
covered by at least a two week's growth of whiskers. They wore rough
clothing, and each man carried a gun slung at his hip. The guns were
not pistols, though. They were automatics, and Dave suddenly had the
hunch that their rescuers were a couple of fire rangers, or at least
some kind of government men. The way they leaped cat-like out the cabin
door and down onto the ground seemed somehow to suggest the military
to Dave. But what they were didn't matter in the slightest. They had
arrived to rescue them, and that was all that counted.

"Stuck, huh?" the older one of the pair grunted, and grinned. "Lucky we
happened to see your smoke signal. You might have camped here for quite
a spell. Army and Navy, huh?"

"And in a hurry," Colonel Welsh said. Then, after introducing himself:
"We had a forced landing. Er--engine trouble. Can you fly us to the
nearest Air Corps Base where we can pick up another plane? I'll see
that you're paid for it, of course."

"Guess so," the man grunted after a look at his partner. "But where're
you headed? Maybe we could hop you all the way, and save time, if
you're in such a hurry."

"San Diego," Colonel Welsh said. "I have to get there as soon as
possible. But maybe you haven't the gas."

"San Diego, huh?" the older one, who was the pilot, murmured, and
arched his brows. "Yeah. I guess we can make it there from here. Had
engine trouble, huh? Not much fun in this neck of the woods. Okay. Get
aboard."

A hidden thought was tugging at Dave's brain, but he couldn't seem to
get it out in the open. Something was just a wee bit wrong with the
picture, but after a moment of deep thought he decided it was worry
about a take-off from the narrow space of level ground.

"Think you've got a long enough run?" he asked, and jerked a thumb at
the crippled Lockheed. "Maybe the five of us should haul that out of
the way. But even then you wouldn't have much extra. There's a sharp
drop-off just ahead of it."

"Don't get in a sweat, kid," the man mouthed, and gave him a hard
stare. "I wouldn't have come down if I'd thought I couldn't get off
again. Just get aboard and keep your seat. We'll get you places, and
with no trouble at all. Okay, Colonel, let's get going."

With a curt nod the pilot and his passenger turned and climbed back
into the plane. Colonel Welsh followed at their heels, but for an
instant Dave and Freddy hung back. They looked at each other and
frowned slightly.

"Queer couple of blokes, aren't they?" the English youth murmured.
"Can't say I like their looks much."

"I've seen better," Dave replied with a nod. "But so long as they
get us out of here, I don't care what they look like. But--is there
something on your mind?"

"Not a thing," Freddy replied. Then, with a puzzled scowl: "Just sort
of feel funny, though. One of your confounded hunches, I guess. Oh
well! No doubt it's your American climate. I'm sure I should have
stayed in England."

"Hop in, or do you two kids want to stay and play boy scout?"

The Stinson's passenger stood framed in the cabin doorway. His blue
green eyes stabbed down at Dave and Freddy, and the mop of coarse red
hair on his head actually did look like fire in the glow of the dawn
sun. Dave stared at him, felt that elusive thought tug at his brain for
the last time, and then climbed into the plane with Freddy right behind.

The pilot at the controls glanced back just long enough to see that
everybody was aboard, and then he goosed the engine and taxied around
on one wheel, and went trundling back toward the far end of the landing
strip. His friend, the redhead, sat in the co-pilot's seat, but he was
twisted around so that he faced Dave, Freddy, and the Colonel, who
were sitting in the three passenger seats. A grin parted his lips, but
he seemed to be grinning over their heads rather than at them.

For a brief instant a clammy chill rippled through Dave. He shook it
off, angrily told himself that he was letting his imagination run wild,
and concentrated on watching the pilot take the plane off. It was a
beautiful bit of flying, and Dave nodded his head in silent approval
and admiration as the pilot held the Stinson on the ground until he had
plenty of forward speed, then gently eased it off and up as nice as
could be.

Holding the nose up, the pilot circled the Stinson upwards until the
mountain peaks were almost on a level with the wings. Flattening off
the climb, he banked around for the last time and went roaring between
two mountain peaks to the north. For a couple of minutes Dave was too
thrilled by the wild, heart stopping beauty of the mountain scenery
below to pay much attention to the course of the plane. Eventually,
though, when the sun continued to stay on the right wing side, he
stopped gaping at the terrain below, and glanced sharply ahead. The
redhead was still grinning, very comfortably relaxed in his seat. And
the pilot was still holding the nose pointed north as though he planned
to keep going in that direction for quite some time to come.

Dave held his peace for a moment or so longer. Then curiosity and an
eerie tingling sensation at the back of his neck forced the words off
his lips.

"We're heading north!" he called out. "San Diego isn't north of us!"

Both Colonel Welsh and Freddy Farmer jumped as though they had been
shot. They turned and stared at him, wide-eyed. The redhead stared at
him, too. But his eyes were slightly narrowed, and his perpetual grin
stiffened slightly. He didn't say anything.

"Well, what is the idea, anyway?" Colonel Welsh finally boomed angrily.
"San Diego is west and south of here!"

The redhead shrugged and nodded, but the pilot didn't even turn his
head.

"That's right, isn't it?" he called out. "Well, what do you know about
that? I guess we ain't heading for San Diego, Colonel. Kind of looks
that way, don't it, huh?"

Colonel Welsh blinked and looked blank for a moment. Then his face
reddened and he started up out of his seat.

"See here!" he thundered. "What in--?"

The redhead made a quick motion, and the chief of U. S. Intelligence
choked off the rest. But it was the automatic that suddenly seemed to
jump right into the redhead's hand that really stopped him. He froze
motionless half up out of his seat. The redhead waved the gun a little.

"Relax, and sit, Colonel!" he said in a voice that sounded like small
stones on a tin roof. "I couldn't let you have it down there, but up
here it's easy. Relax and get smart. And that goes for you two kids,
too!"




CHAPTER TEN

_Vulture's Nest_


For a long minute there was no sound inside the cabin save the faint
drone of the plane's engine. Like three men suddenly struck dumb, Dave,
Freddy, and the Colonel stared at the redhead. Rather, they stared at
the automatic he held in his right hand; held so that at the bat of
an eyelash he could send a bullet into either of them, or into all
three of them, for that matter. Then, finally, Colonel Welsh broke the
silence.

"What in thunder _is_ this?" he demanded. "Who are you two? What's the
idea?"

The redhead hunched his shoulders and half nodded his head toward the
pilot.

"That's Ike, and I'm Mike," he said with a chuckle. "But it isn't any
act. We're just keeping you on ice for a while, Colonel. Be nice and
you'll get back into circulation again in time. Be dumb, and you'll be
dead."

As the Colonel struggled for words, Dave leaned forward a little, arms
resting on his knees.

"This isn't the plane you flew last night," he said.

The redhead grinned all the more and shook his head.

"Nope," he said. "And that makes you a bright little boy--Flight
Lieutenant Dawson. And that was nice flying last night. I thought that
second time I had you cold. I guess you're as good at the controls as
I've heard tell you were. Or was this English kid, Farmer, doing the
flying?"

Dave didn't reply. He suddenly felt as though his seat had been
jerked out from under him, and as if his brain were tumbling down
through space. This redhead knew his name, and Freddy's, too? An eerie
chill swept through him, and he impulsively looked at Colonel Welsh.
The chief of U. S. Intelligence's face was bright with dumfounded
amazement. He in turn was staring speechlessly at the redhead. The man
with the gun dragged down a corner of his mouth in a scornful gesture.

"Why so surprised, Colonel?" he asked. "Did you think you were the only
smart one in this war?"

"You won't feel so smart when you're facing a firing squad!" the
Colonel clipped out. "And that's where you're headed. Both of you!"

"Well, what do you know!" the pilot cried out, and turned around just
long enough to give the Colonel a horse laugh. "Maybe you ain't got it
yet, Colonel, who's holding the gun. Snap out of it. I know it's tough,
but there's nothing you can do about it. Don't be a sap and make us let
you have it. We just want to keep you on ice for a while. That's all."

The Colonel seemed to swallow his wrath, because when he spoke again
his voice was normal, and almost friendly.

"All right, we'll be smart," he said. "But where are we heading? And
why are you keeping us on ice, as you call it? What good is it going to
do you?"

"What good?" the redhead echoed with a laugh. "Well, about ten thousand
dollars' worth, for one thing. For another--well, I guess we just don't
like you."

A hard, glittering look leaped into the Colonel's eyes, and Dave could
tell that the man was employing every ounce of his will power to stop
from leaping from his seat and hurling himself at the redhead, gun or
no gun.

"A couple of bought and paid for American traitors, eh?" the chief of
U. S. Intelligence suddenly grated. "American by birth only. Actually
lower than the rats in Berlin and Tokio are--the ones who are paying
you your blood money. Well, paste this in your hats. You'll never live
to spend that money. And that's a promise!"

The redhead simply continued to grin. Then suddenly the gun in his hand
spat flame and sound, and Dave saw the Colonel's left shoulder strap
fly off as though cut by a knife. The bullet tore on out through the
side of the cabin. Colonel Welsh didn't so much as flinch, or even bat
an eye. He held the redhead with a steady agate-eyed stare.

"Put the next right between my eyes!" he grated. "You'll still not
be able to spend that blood money. You'll be run to earth like the
anti-American vermin you are. And you'll be wiped out, along with the
rest of your fifth column brood."

The redhead didn't say anything. Dave wasn't sure, but he thought he
saw a look of fear flash across the man's unshaven face. However, it
came and went in a flash. The pilot turned from his controls again, and
gave the Colonel a long look.

"Maybe!" he finally said harshly. "That's the chance we take. But let's
not kid each other, Colonel. The point is that the Carrier Indian won't
be sailing with these two little heroes of yours aboard. Yeah! So don't
look like you're going to faint. We know all about it. The boys we work
for are smart. And your whole country is going to find that out in
short order, too.

"You guys in Washington have got a New Deal. Well, another guy has a
_New Deal_, too. I like his better. So don't waste breath trying to
unsell me. It can't be done. I've been kicked around too much by your
cops and F.B.I.

"I'm looking out for my own good, see? I found out how my pal and me
can make dough easy, and we're making it. No more working my life away
for nothing. I'm sold on _my_ New Deal.

"Now shut up, and relax. My pal and me have dough to earn."

"Aw, let 'em talk!" the redhead said with a hoarse laugh. "Maybe
they'll try selling us some of them Defense Bonds."

"And you shut up, too!" the pilot snarled. "I don't feel like hearing
anybody talk, see?"

The redhead looked both surprised and angry.

"Okay, okay!" he said. "So nobody talks."

Silence once more settled over the interior of the cabin, but it was
the kind of a silence that feels charged with high voltage electricity,
and apt to strike all over the place at an instant's notice. Turning
his head, Dave snapped a quick glance out the window, but what he saw
didn't help his spirits any. The plane was grinding northward over wild
mountainous country that looked every bit as uninviting as that narrow
strip of ground where they had force landed. Whether or not they had
reached the Utah line, or were still in Arizona, Dave couldn't tell
with that one quick glance. And he didn't bother taking a second look.

Fact was, it didn't matter where they were. Through a crazy twist of
fate they were helpless prisoners in the hands of two men who would
shoot them dead at the slightest provocation. The single warning shot
that the redhead had snapped across Colonel Welsh's shoulder had been
proof enough that he wasn't afraid to use his gun.

Yes, they were helpless prisoners. And their captors knew all about
them: who they were, where they had been heading, and why. As those
three truths came home to Dave, again he swallowed hard and shivered
slightly. It was like a crazy nightmare, only it wasn't. It was stark
reality; nothing out of a story book. The pilot and his redheaded
companion had received orders to make sure that Freddy Farmer and he
did not sail on the Aircraft Carrier Indian. They had tried the first
time last night by attacking them with machine guns in a plane.

They had failed, yet in a way they had succeeded. They had drilled the
Lockheed's engines and forced Dave to sit down on that narrow strip
of smooth ground deep in a valley. Not knowing the exact results of
their efforts, the two men had cruised about over the area as soon as
it became light, and--by another crazy twist of fate--they had seen
the smoke signal that had been sent up to attract _help_. Seeing that
the plane had not crashed, the two men had done the logical thing,
from their point of view. They had landed and picked up their prey.
Kidnapped them, yes, but for a very good reason. Some other plane
passing over might have landed and given them a quick lift to their
destination. So the redhead and the pilot had picked them up to make
sure somebody else wouldn't do it.

And the reason they hadn't been killed on the spot was simple to
figure. Death in the dark during that air attack last night would
have been different. The plane would have crashed and burned up, and
when its charred ruins were found no one would ever had dreamed that
bullets had sent it hurtling down to its doom. But three dead men lying
beside a force landed plane was something else again. A scene like
that naturally screamed murder all over the place. And so the redhead
and his pilot had kidnapped them so that if another plane landed to
investigate, it would look as though the occupants of the Lockheed had
tried to find their way back to civilization on foot, and had become
hopelessly lost in the mountains.

"But they know all about us! How?"

Dave didn't speak the words aloud. He spoke them only in his brain,
but as he glanced at Colonel Welsh and met the man's eyes he knew that
the senior officer understood what was in his mind, just as though he
had heard the words spoken. Even as Dave met his eyes, Colonel Welsh
bit his lower lip and gave a sharp little puzzled shake of his head. A
hundred and one answers to the question leaped into Dave's brain, but
every one of them seemed too fantastic even to bother considering.

However, fantastic or not, one thought kept hammering away until he was
forced to admit that it at least must be true. It was that somebody
close to Colonel Welsh--very close--was unquestionably in the pay of
Berlin, or Tokio. Somebody in the drab, unpretentious building where
Colonel Welsh maintained his real head-quarters was a traitor to the
American flag, a paid rat of the lowest form who gnawed at the very
heart of America.

But who? Dave thought of Captain Lamb, and Captain Stacey, and
Lieutenant Caldwell--and shook his head vigorously. He thought of the
man who had taken them up in the elevator--and wondered. He thought
of the man reading the book in that room with the mops and pails--and
wondered some more. In fact, he wondered until his head ached and his
brain rang. It just didn't seem possible that any spy could get close
enough to learn all that somebody had learned. That, however, was one
of the many cockeyed things about war. The impossible was constantly
popping up to prove to be a cinch. There were over two years of proof
of that. Poland for one. The Maginot Line for another. And Crete, and
Malaya, and Singapore--and Pearl Harbor, too, for that matter. All that
had happened at those various places just couldn't happen. Only it
_had_!

"So maybe Lamb, or Stacey, or--"

Dave cut short the unspoken thought. The pilot up forward had throttled
his engine and was nosing the Stinson downward. Leaning over close
to the window, Dave peered down and ahead. He saw a stretch of wild
wasteland that seemed to extend to the four horizons. Scrub growth,
a few patches of towering trees, and all the rocks in the world, it
seemed, met his scrutiny. The plane seemed to be nosing down toward an
area of tableland. And as Dave squinted his eyes he suddenly was able
to make out a couple of weatherbeaten shacks built close to a patch of
woods. He thought he saw something glistening just under the branches
of the trees, but he was too high and too far away to tell what it was.

"Okay!" the redhead suddenly called out. "We're getting near the end
of the line. Remember what I told you, you three. Be nice and nothing
will happen. Get funny and I'll drill you and think nothing of it, so
help me. I ain't a killer often, but when I am, I'm good. So watch your
step."




CHAPTER ELEVEN

_A Little Bit Of England!_


Dave didn't bother looking at the redhead as the man pushed words off
the tip of his tongue. He kept his nose pressed against the cabin
window and watched with beating heart as the area of tableland came
sweeping up closer and closer to the plane. The nearer the plane got to
the ground, the more weatherbeaten and deserted the two shacks looked.
In fact, Dave knew that if he should be flying over them at even a
thousand feet or so, he would instantly take them for a couple of
prospectors' shacks abandoned to the wind and the rain years and years
before.

Another couple of minutes and the Stinson went up on wing, cut around
in a dime turn, and then leveled off and settled to earth between two
rows of sun-bleached rocks. Hardly had the plane braked to a halt than
the redhead was at the cabin door, pushing it open with one hand behind
him, and backing out. Every second of the time, though, he kept his
blue green eyes fastened on his prisoners.

"I'll take them inside while you put the job away," he said to the
pilot. "Stick her way under the trees with that Waco, just in case some
nosy guys come flying over. Nuts to take chances, you know. We'll--"

"Can it!" the pilot snarled. "Who are you, giving orders? Take them
inside. I'll be along in a minute, and help tie them up. But keep that
gun ready, and use it if you have to. We can't risk anything, see?"

"I see, sure I see!" the redhead snarled back. "What's eating you,
anyway?"

"Nothing, and shut up!" the pilot said in a brittle voice.

The redhead nodded, and motioned with his gun to Dave and the other two.

"Out!" he snapped. "And watch it. And keep your hands in sight, too."

Dave obeyed to the letter, but his heart was thumping against his ribs.
He had a sneaky feeling that Colonel Welsh's words had had a profound
effect on the pilot. Sure, he had snarled, and boasted, and cursed the
United States, the land of his birth. But like all rats of his ilk,
deep down in his black heart he was scared stiff of the Old Man With
the Whiskers. Deep down in his heart he knew that he might get by with
this back stabbing for a little while--just like the Japs--but not for
long. In the end he would be caught in the wheels of right and justice
and be ground to a pulp.

With the pilot feeling as he obviously did, snapping and snarling at
his own partner in this dirty work, perhaps something could be made of
it. Perhaps--

Dave didn't finish the rest. Without realizing it he had sort of
stopped to mull things over as he climbed down from the plane. He had
unconsciously started to push one hand into his tunic pocket. He didn't
even realize he was making the movement, but the redhead saw it, took
it for the wrong thing, and moved with the speed of light. The barrel
of the automatic was slapped against the left side of Dave's jaw just
hard enough for him to see stars and stumble. He ended up by falling
the rest of the way out of the cabin doorway and landing flat on his
face on hard dirt.

"And stay there!" he heard the redhead growl. "I'll take that gun just
as soon as your two pals are down. Okay, you two. Out, and keep your
hands where I can see them. Okay! Now, flat on your bellies and hands
outstretched. Either of you move, and you get it."

A moment later Dave felt the muzzle of the automatic pressed against
the back of his head, and felt the redhead's other hand going through
his pockets. He didn't move a muscle, and presently an angry curse told
him that the redhead realized he was wrong. Then the gun tapped him
lightly on the head.

"Stay put, with your hands out!" the redhead said. "I'll just make sure
about your pals."

Dave kept his throbbing face buried in the dirt until he heard the
redhead's voice again.

"Okay, on your feet, and inside! And no more kidding moves like that
last one, Dawson. My trigger finger's getting plenty itchy. Okay, move!"

Dave got slowly to his feet, blinked from his eyes water caused by
smacking the ground with his face, and walked stiff-legged in through
the door of the nearest shack. He expected to step into a room heavy
with age, and dust, and dirt, and all the countless smells of the
years. But he didn't. He stepped into a large sized room that was
comfortably furnished and fitted out like a hunting lodge. No, not
exactly a hunting lodge. Rather, it looked more like an arsenal.
There were guns all over the place, of all types: pistols, automatics,
rifles, and machine guns. Along the entire right wall were heavy wood
boxes that obviously contained thousands and thousands of rounds of
ammunition.

But what caught Dave's eyes and held them was the powerful gas engine
operated short-wave radio receiving set and transmitter that took up
most of the space at the rear of the room. One glance told him that
every part of it was of the finest equipment, and that its operator
could contact points thousands and thousands of miles away. One look at
the set and he guessed instantly that one of its chief uses was to send
weather data to listening Axis ears. This was probably one of several
such stations hidden in the vastness of the United States. In time they
would be smoked out and destroyed. Meantime, though, they were serving
the Axis powers well, and, unquestionably, in a dozen different ways.

"Not bad, huh?" he heard the redhead's voice with its taunting note.
"We have lots of fun here, Mike and Ike. See what I mean, Colonel? We
got it all doped out. You Army and Navy guys are suckers. You don't
stand a chance, what I mean. When the time's right, we'll move in.
And that's all there'll be to it, see? Steady, Colonel! Steady, pal.
Rushing me will just get you a bullet in that belly of yours. Take it
easy, and relax. Back up, and sit down on that case. You two kids, too."

As the redhead grinned and made motions with the gun, Dave, Freddy,
and the Colonel slowly backed up until they were sitting on a couple
of gun cases. Once they were settled, with their hands carefully kept
in sight, the redhead hooked one leg over a nearby table and absently
stroked the palm of his other hand with the barrel of his automatic.
Dave heard Colonel Welsh's tight, rasping breathing beside him, but he
didn't look at the man. Nor did he glance at Freddy Farmer, who hadn't
spoken a word since they had entered the Stinson. Instead, Dave kept
his eyes fixed on the redhead--and waited, and hoped, and prayed.

"Yeah, we have us some fun here," the redhead went on, and looked
straight at Colonel Welsh. "But soon we're going to have some real fun.
See all these guns, Colonel? Lots of people are going to hear them pop
off, soon. People east in Washington, too. The boys running this show
have it all doped out. It'll be a cinch."

"Do you know what you are?" the Colonel suddenly asked with an effort.

"No, you tell me, Colonel," the redhead said with a chuckle. Then,
before Colonel Welsh could get a word in edgewise: "You know, I'd
never tab you for head of the Intelligence, Colonel. You don't look
the part to me at all. But maybe that's what's made you the great man
of mystery, eh? Well, the mystery is over as far as I'm concerned. And
to tell you the truth, I'm kind of disappointed. When we got the radio
flash that you were aboard a plane heading west with these two kids,
I got kind of all excited. I got kind of sorry, too, that I'd have to
shoot you down without having a look at you. But--well, I did get that
look after all. And I'm disappointed."

"And you are a complete and utter fool!" Colonel Welsh said,
tight-lipped. "I told you once, and I tell you again! You'll never get
away with this. You'll be caught and either strung up, or shot. You'll
get--"

"Didn't I tell you to shut up? Well, do it. We can't be bothered
listening to your junk. Shut up! _Do you hear me!_"

It was the voice of the pilot, who had suddenly appeared in the
doorway. He stood glaring at Colonel Welsh out of eyes that held a
wild, glassy glitter. Two white spots appeared on either cheek, and as
the last left his lips they came together to form a thin cruel line.
Then before Colonel Welsh, or Dave, or Freddy Farmer could so much as
move a muscle, the man leaped forward and slammed his upholstered gun
against the Colonel's left temple. The chief of U. S. Intelligence
slumped over, but caught himself and straightened up slowly. A trickle
of blood ran down from the cut on his temple, but he made no effort to
raise his hand to it. He looked at the pilot and smiled grimly. Dave
marveled silently at the man's courage and ability to take it. The blow
he had received was enough to knock over a horse.

"Swing again, you rat traitor!" the Colonel got out evenly. "You know
in your heart that you're sunk. And it's making you lose your grip."

For an instant Dave thought the pilot was going to go stark raving
mad with rage and hurl himself at the Colonel. But he didn't. With a
visibly tremendous effort he regained control of himself and forced a
harsh laugh off his lips.

"That's what you think!" he snapped. Then out of the corner of his
mouth to his partner: "Get that rope, and we'll tie them up. We'll gag
this big slob. I'm sick of hearing his yapping."

Less than five minutes later Dave and Freddy were bound hand and foot.
Colonel Welsh was bound hand and foot, too, but he was also gagged. The
pilot made sure that the ropes were tied right, then turned his back
on them and walked over to a table on the other side of the room. He
picked up a whiskey bottle there, took a long drink and choked on it.
He coughed so hard he almost dropped the bottle. He would have if the
redhead hadn't jumped quickly forward and grabbed it.

"Hey, what's the matter with you?" the redhead demanded angrily. "You
getting the jim-jams? This is no time to fall apart. Snap out of it.
Get hold of yourself. Boy! Wouldn't the big boss like to see you, now.
I knew he should have put me in charge of this station."

The pilot suddenly went white about the corners of his mouth, and there
was cold murder in the eyes he fixed on the redhead. He reached out and
tapped the redhead on the chest with the barrel of his automatic.

"Just say that again, lug," he grated. "Go on! Just say it again!"

The redhead seemed to wilt like a flower tossed into a blast furnace.
He gulped and swallowed hard, and backed away a couple of steps.

"Okay, okay!" he got out hastily. "I was only kidding. But I only
thought--"

"Nobody wants you to think!" the pilot snarled, and took a step
forward. "Get it? Cut out the thinking. Now, get on that key and
contact Frisco. Tell them we've got them on ice, and what do we do now?
Tell them this place is cooked, if either of these three should get
away. Find out where he wants them delivered, or what. He was nuts to
have us go hunting them, and bring them back here. They'd have been
stuck there a week, anyway. And that's more time than we need to fly
these guns and stuff to the other places. But skip that last. Don't
tell them that, understand. The big boy wouldn't like it."

"I'll say he wouldn't!" the redhead said with a tight laugh, and went
through the motions of slitting his throat from ear to ear. "Okay. I'll
find out what we do now. Fun, I hope."

The redhead flung the trio of prisoners a leering look, then went to
the back of the room and sat down at the radio equipment. A moment or
so later the crackling of the spark gap of a wireless set filled the
room. Dave closed his eyes and strained his ears. He caught the signal
being sent out. It was S-T. It was repeated a dozen times or more.
Then the man stopped sending, and there was silence as he listened to
whatever was coming through his earphones. After twenty seconds or so
he started sending again. Dave caught all the signals, but that's all
the good it did him. He glanced at Freddy Farmer and Colonel Welsh, and
knew that they were catching the signals, too, and that the code going
out over the air was just as meaningless to them as it was to him.

For five minutes the redhead "talked" with the man at the other end of
the wave length. Then he switched off his set, got up and turned around
with a grin on his face that stretched from ear to ear.

"He thinks we're great guys," he said to his partner. "He thinks we're
the nuts."

"Horses to what he thinks!" the pilot growled, and ran a nervous tongue
tip along his lower lip. "What do we do now? What are his orders?"

"To sit tight," the redhead said. Then, after flashing Colonel Welsh a
smirking look, he went on, "He's coming up here sometime tonight. He
didn't say, but I've got a hunch he wants to work on our three friends
here. But he's tickled silly about it all. What a break for us we were
bum shots last night. This little job puts us in good, I'm telling you.
Boy! You can't top the big boss, can you? He knows his onions right
down the line. Yeah! Old blabber mouth, there, is going to have plenty
of chance to work his yap. And I mean, but plenty! Maybe he won't want
to, but I've seen the big boss's way of getting guys to talk. He's got
a technique, he has!"

"Coming up tonight, huh?" the pilot echoed with a happy smile. "Swell!
That means you and me will be shifted to some other station. And
that'll suit me okay. This neck of the woods is giving me the creeps.
Thirty days here. It's been like thirty years. Let's have a drink on
getting out of here soon."

"Yeah!" the redhead said, and licked his lips. "Let's have a couple of
them. I'm dry as a bone."

With that moment began an hour and a half that was just about the
toughest ninety minutes Dave Dawson had ever spent in his life. The
two unshaven men went over to the table and dropped into chairs and
proceeded to ignore their prisoners. That didn't bother Dave in the
slightest, though. He was quite content to have the two ignore him,
for he was too busy with his thoughts--thoughts that tumbled and
spilled around in his brain like little red hot stones. A hundred times
at least he strained at the ropes that held his wrists bound behind
his back. And a hundred times circles of white pain about his wrists
convinced him that he didn't stand a chance in the world of freeing his
hands, to say nothing of his ankles. A hundred times he cursed himself
bitterly for not getting away from that attacker last night--and
without damage to the Lockheed's engines. A hundred times he thought of
the Aircraft Carrier Indian and the unknown doom that hovered over her;
the unknown doom that was aboard her in the form of some rat Axis spy
who had killed and obtained vital information that could easily spell
disaster for many of Uncle Sam's fighting men of the sea if it reached
Japanese hands soon enough.

A hundred times he thought of many things, and each time his utter
helplessness to do anything about them was like a hot knife twisting
in his heart. But the most torturing thing of all was the realization
that he and Freddy had been stopped cold before they had even been able
to get started. The Carrier Indian was over three hundred miles away,
riding at anchor in San Diego harbor. Who knew when they would see it?
Who knew if they would _ever_ see it? Caught cold before they had even
got started on the very first of the special assignments they were to
carry out for Uncle Sam. What a sweet beginning! Yes! What a sweet
beginning that could well be the end, too. And that end might come when
the man referred to as the big boss arrived.

Thoughts, thoughts, and more thoughts that walked, raced, cut and
slashed their way through Dave's brain. Seconds dragged on into
minutes, and the minutes seemed to drag on into an eternity of time.
Then suddenly sound forced its way through Dave's thoughts and brought
him back to the present. The sound was soft moaning and groaning. And
it came from Freddy Farmer's lips.

The English youth was sitting on a gun case just beyond where Colonel
Welsh sat, but out in front of him so that Dave could see his pal.
And the look on Freddy's face was one of great pain, and not a little
of terror, and fear. His eyes were half closed, and he seemed to be
staring at nothing at all as he rocked jerkily back and forth like some
African savage praying to his idol gods. For a brief instant Dave
could hardly believe his eyes or his ears. Then a wave of sympathy
mingled with just a little annoyance swept through him.

"Pull up your socks, Freddy!" he said in a low voice. "Show these rats
you can take it. Come on, Freddy. Chin up, pal!"

The English youth groaned louder and opened his eyes a little. The look
he flung Dave burned with scorn.

"Blast you and your chin-up rot!" he grated. "I've had enough of this.
Gangster stuff, this is, not war. I know now I should never have left
England. This is a madman's country. I tell you I've had enough of it!"

Freddy fairly screamed the last, and had Dave not been tied hand and
foot he would have leaped over and slapped his pal's jaw. Something had
happened to Freddy Farmer. Something had snapped inside of him. Dave
had seen his pal in a hundred tight corners, every bit as tight as this
one. He knew full well that Freddy was red-blooded courage from his
head to his feet. But something had happened, and the English youth was
ready to crack up like an hysterical old woman.

"Freddy, cut it out!" he snapped. "Buck up, old man. Show them. Come
on, Freddy. The old R.A.F. stuff. We're not licked yet, and we won't
be. You know that!"

The English youth didn't answer at once. He sat swaying and groaning,
and staring at Dave out of half closed eyes. Then suddenly he began to
laugh softly. The laugh grew and grew until it was almost a scream.
The pilot and the redhead had put down their whiskey glasses and were
staring at him in wide-eyed amazement.

"R.A.F., my hat!" Freddy suddenly shouted. "This isn't war. This is
gangster business, like I've seen in your American movies. Well, I've
had enough of it. I can't stand it, do you understand. _I can't stand
it!_ These ropes are killing me. I feel as if I were all on fire!"

Freddy stopped short, looked over at the unshaven pair and spoke again
before Dave had time to open his mouth.

"I say, a drink of water, please!" he gasped. "I must have a drink of
water. I'm dying, really. I can't stand the pain. A drink of water,
please!"

The pair stared for a moment longer; then the redhead burst out with
laughter.

"The tough English, huh?" he jeered aloud. "Look at the brave R.A.F.
pilot, I don't think! Well, what do you know? The English can't take
it. I always said they couldn't. Mama! Mama! Sonny boy wants a drink of
water. Here! Pour a slug of this whiskey down his throat and make a man
of him. Okay, I'll do it!"

The redhead laughed some more and splashed whiskey from the bottle into
his glass. He pushed up from the table and came swaggering over to
Freddy Farmer.

"Here you are, sonny boy," he said, and leaned over to put the glass to
the English youth's lips. "Be Papa's great big man. Have a drink. Go
on, take some!"

Freddy Farmer groaned just once more, then leaned forward as though he
were going to drink. But he didn't drink. He became an exploding ball
of chain lightning, instead. Almost before Dave Dawson's startled eyes
could register what was taking place, Freddy Farmer whipped his right
hand around from behind his back and plucked the redhead's automatic
from its holster. In what was practically the same motion, the English
youth stood up and clubbed the gun down on the redhead's ear. At the
same time Freddy brought up his left clenched fist and landed solidly
on the man's jaw. The man closed his eyes, and folded up like an old
army cot to the floor.

The English youth didn't so much as watch the redhead crumple. Instead
he brought the automatic down into line with the pilot sitting stunned
at the table on the other side of the room.

"Don't even wink an eye!" Freddy barked, and slowly sat down again. "I
can put a bullet in your rotten heart from here with my eyes closed.
Keep your hands just as they are on the table. Don't move them an inch,
you dirty blighter!"




CHAPTER TWELVE

_Westward To War_


As Freddy Farmer hurled the words at the pilot, he reached down with
his other hand and fumbled with the ropes tied about his ankles. In
less than a minute he had them free. Still keeping his eye on the
pilot, who now was practically green with terror, he went over and
around in back of the man. In less time than it takes to tell about it,
he had his gun. Then he jerked him from his chair and spun him around.

"Sorry, old thing," he said, tight-lipped. "But you shouldn't say
things like that about America. Next to England, it's the grandest
country on earth."

The pilot blinked stupidly. Then he closed his eyes for good. He did
so because Freddy Farmer slugged him on the jaw, putting every ounce
of his one hundred and fifty-five pounds behind the blow. The pilot
turned slowly around twice, then fell flat on his face alongside his
unconscious pal. And it was then Dave realized he was not dreaming, and
was able to find his tongue.

"Holy jumping jellyfish!" he gasped. "I--I thought you'd blown your
top, Freddy. But it was a gag, huh? Boy, oh boy! Me for you, pal, every
day in the week, and twice on Sundays. Gee, Freddy! I'm a no good bum
for thinking--"

"Quite!" the English youth said with a wide grin. "But I'll forgive you
this once. But speaking of gags. I'll free the Colonel, and then see
about you. Just cool your heels a bit, my little man."

Moving over to the Colonel, Freddy took the gag away and freed the
senior officer's hands and feet. It wasn't until he was completely free
that the Intelligence chief was able to speak.

"I'll never forget this, Farmer, never!" he exclaimed in a rush of
words. "One of the finest things I ever saw in my life. I can hardly
believe it even now. It--well, it was like magic. It must have been.
How in blue blazes did you manage to free your hands? Mine were tied so
tight they still feel broken in a dozen places."

As the Colonel spoke he rubbed his hands and wrists vigorously. Freddy
blushed to the roots of his hair, but there was a pleased grin on his
lips.

"They tied me pretty tight, too, sir," he said. "But a chap in England
once showed me a trick of holding your hands so that there's still a
little slack no matter how tight they're tied. It doesn't work with
most people. I mean you have to have thin hands, and be able to sort
of fold them up so's they're no thicker than your wrists. Then you can
slide the ropes off, if you work at it long enough. I--well, I was able
to do it. The moaning and the request for a drink was just to get one
of them close enough. I hope you don't think I meant the things I said,
sir."

"Don't worry," the Colonel said, and slapped Freddy on the shoulder.
"You can say anything you want, at any time, and it will always be
okay with me, after this. I mean it! You make me feel like an amateur,
Farmer. It was wonderful. But let's get these two tied up while they're
still listening to the birdies. What a sweet punch you've got, Farmer.
And at your weight, too! You'd keep Joe Louis busy any time. But let's
get at these two, and get going."

Freddy and the Colonel bent over the two prostrate forms and started
roping them up hand and foot. Dave watched for a moment, then made
sounds in his throat.

"Hey!" he shouted. "I'm here, you know!"

Freddy turned his head and looked at him. Bright lights danced in the
English youth's eyes.

"Why, so you are," he murmured, and gave the Colonel a quick wink.
"Just who are you? And when did you come in?"

"Cut the comedy!" Dawson howled. "Get these confounded ropes off me, or
I'll fan your breeches plenty next time I get my hands on you, young
fellow!"

Freddy shrugged, pursed his lips and cocked an eyebrow at the Colonel.

"Bit violent, isn't he?" he grunted. "Think we should let him loose, or
wait a bit until he cools down?"

"I don't know," the Colonel said with a chuckle. "You're the boss. Do
as you think best. Maybe, if he said 'pretty please,' or something."

"Quite," Freddy said, and turned to Dave. "Say 'pretty please,' and
I'll consider it," he grinned.

Dave looked daggers, and pressed his lips tightly together. Freddy
sighed, stood up and started brushing dust off his uniform.

"What do we do now, sir?" he asked, and deliberately turned his back
on Dawson. "Want me to fly you to San Diego, and have somebody come
back for these three? Or--"

"Okay, okay, you win, you sawed off made in England little runt!" Dave
roared. "Pretty please, confound you. Now untie me, for cat's sake."

Freddy walked over to him and leveled a reprimanding finger.

"Such a tone of voice!" he admonished sternly. "Say it nicely, just as
you were taught in school, now."

Dave turned forty different colors of the rainbow, but he finally
managed to swallow his wrath.

"Pretty please," he said. "I will remember this moment always. And I
mean _always_, you cluck!"

Freddy laughed, and in half a minute had Dave free. As he pulled the
last rope loose, he stepped quickly backward and set himself for the
expected rush. But Dave simply rubbed his hands and wrists and glared
at him.

"Relax!" he growled. "I'm going to save this one up, you betcha! And
when the right time comes, will you sing a song and dance a dance for
me! Kidding aside, though, Freddy, that was something. I really mean
it. Boy! Can you always come up with something new! But don't think
that means I'm going to forget, you little bum. My turn will come."

Freddy grinned at him impishly, and then both stopped their horse play
and turned serious eyes toward the Colonel.

"We can still make San Diego with time to spare, sir," Dave said with a
glance at his watch. "Are we going to take those two along with us?"

"We certainly are," the Colonel said, and pointed a finger at the
pilot. "That one is just ripe to be cracked wide open. He'll blab
everything he knows to save his own neck. I've met his type often. Hard
as nails on the surface, but completely yellow underneath."

"It's pretty hard to believe that a couple of Americans would stoop
this low," Dave said, tight-lipped. "But I suppose the Axis has a fifth
column working here in the States just as they had in every other
country they tackled."

"True enough," the Colonel replied with a nod. "And as the saying
goes, some men will sell their souls for gold. Those two are the type.
Country and flag don't mean a thing to them. Something twisted inside
of them. They weren't put together right in the first place. But this
is a big thing for my bureau, boys! And for the F.B.I., too. I have
a hunch I know who their big boss is--a man the F.B.I.'s been after
for weeks. There'll be a welcoming committee waiting for him tonight.
Have no fear of that. Before we get going, however, I want to have a
quick look around here. Give me a hand. Maybe we'll find something of
importance. We've got an hour or so, haven't we?"

"Easy," Dave replied. "Shall we hunt for something special?"

"Hunt for anything!" the Colonel said grimly. "And pray for a miracle
find."

"Steady does it, Freddy," he said gently. "We're still alive. And we're

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

PREFACE.


The very extensive sale of Practical Etiquette, a sale that has
required the issuance of a large number of editions of the little
manual, has been very gratifying to its author, as was also the
commission of its publisher to re-write and enlarge the work. This
commission, however, brought with it a keen sense of responsibility,
for the author feels that a new work on etiquette can find a _raison
d’être_ only in a fairly successful attempt at answering practically
every question that can arise concerning social relations, at least
in ordinary social life. But to speak with authority on all matters
of “good form” is to speak dogmatically, and so to speak is in itself
not good form. Nevertheless, and in spite of this dilemma, the author
has attempted herein to decide, when compelled to do so, between
conflicting opinions in mere matters of social custom, and has given
as authority the opinion that seemed to her to conform most nearly
to common sense, embodying such opinion in an unqualified statement
without citing authority. Fortunately, social customs are now so nearly
uniform in all parts of the country, that one familiar with the ways of
good society in the West or in the North, is at home in good society in
the East or in the South.

The author is under obligation to so many persons for suggestions and
advice, as well as to many authors, that it does not seem best to give
a list of the same, especially as such list could be only a partial
one, for many of her friends would not desire mention of their names.

INTRODUCTION.

  “True politeness is to do and say
   The kindest thing in the kindest way.”


If civil law is the outgrowth of regard for other people’s rights,
social law is equally the outgrowth of regard for other people’s
feelings and convenience. Social law is kindness and good-will and the
desire to be agreeable codified. A system of so much importance cannot
be unworthy of consideration.

The very essence of good manners is self-possession, and
self-possession is another name for self-forgetfulness. Gentility is
neither in birth, manner, nor fashion, but in the mind. A high sense
of honor, a determination never to take a mean advantage of another,
and an adherence to truth, delicacy, and politeness towards those
with whom one may have dealings, are the essential and distinguishing
characteristics of a gentleman.

Quietness in all things is an essential element to a well-bred person.
He shuns all outward display of his personality; he cares not to be
seen or heard; he eschews noisy and grandiloquent talk; he avoids
showy and noticeable costumes. His voice is low; his words simple; and
his actions grave. He holds himself habitually under restraint; his
words never seem to vibrate with emotion.

Habits are said to be good or bad as the result of actions that are
right or wrong. A man of good habits is one who has for so long a time
practiced right thinking, speaking, and doing, that he acts properly
from force of habit.

Good manners are not to be put on for particular occasions, like fine
clothes, but they should be one’s second nature. The simpler and more
easy and unconstrained one’s manners, the more he will impress people
with his good breeding. Affectation is one of the brazen marks of
vulgarity.

CHAPTER I.

INTRODUCTIONS, CALLS, CARDS, VISITING.

    “A beautiful behavior gives a higher pleasure than
    statues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine
    arts.”—_Emerson._


INTRODUCTIONS.

In introducing persons, one should be careful to pronounce each name
distinctly.

When either name is not perfectly understood, a repetition of it should
be requested of the person making the introduction. When introductions
are given, it is the man who should be presented to the woman; when two
women are introduced, it is the younger who is presented to the elder.
For example, in presenting Mr. Jones to Mrs. Smith, it is Mrs. Smith’s
name that is first mentioned. The word “introduce” is preferred to
“present.” Informal introductions are given by merely mentioning the
names; as, “Mrs. Smith, Mr. Jones,” and this is ordinarily sufficient.

In introducing two sisters, the elder is “Miss Smith” and the younger
“Miss Virginia Smith.”

When two women are introduced to each other, it is not necessary for
either to rise; a bow and a smile from each is sufficient.

A woman does not rise when a man is presented to her, unless he is
very old or is a person of great importance. Upon being introduced, a
married woman may offer her hand to a man but it is not customary for a
young woman to do so.

It is the duty of a man who attends a private entertainment, to have
himself presented to every member of the family whom he does not know.

An introduction in the street car is very bad form.

One should never forget that it is difficult, almost impossible, for
some people to remember names and faces, and that such people actually
suffer from their inability to recognize and call by name persons to
whom they may have been introduced recently.

It is not uncommon to see one approach such a person, offer her hand,
and say, if there is not an immediate recognition, “I am afraid you
do not remember me,” while the person approached stands in agony, and
gradually makes an apology for her poor memory, and asks the name.

One who is truly polite, who is at all thoughtful for another person’s
feelings, would not be the cause of such a scene. She would prevent it
by saying: “I am Mrs. Smith. I had the pleasure of meeting you at Mrs.
Brown’s luncheon last Thursday;” or something of the kind.

Whenever one has reason to think his name or face may have been
forgotten, he should make himself known, in approaching another person,
by giving his name at least.


CALLS.

A first call ought to be returned within a very short time.

A lady when receiving rises as her callers enter, and they immediately
advance to pay their respects to her before speaking to others.

A man takes any vacant chair, without troubling the hostess to look
after him.

A man rises when women with whom he is talking rise to take their
leave. Women calling do not rise unless those who are leaving are
friends older than themselves.

When taking leave, one ought to choose a moment when there is a lull in
the conversation, and then take leave of the hostess, letting one bow
include the others in the room.

One month after the birth of a child, a call of congratulation is made
by acquaintances.

A call of condolence is made within ten days after the death, if the
caller is on intimate terms with the family, or within a month if
otherwise.

Calls of congratulation are due to the newly married, and to the
parents who gave the invitations to the marriage.

A man invited by a woman to call upon her, cannot, without great
discourtesy, neglect to pay the call within a week.

A lady will never keep a caller waiting, without sending word that she
will be in immediately.

One ought always to return a call, but if the acquaintance is not
desirable, the first call may be the last.

Some women only rise when their callers leave, others accompany them as
far as the drawing-room door; but it is always polite for a hostess to
accompany her visitors to the front door when they take their leave,
if there is not a servant on hand to open the door for them. The best
bred hostesses even go so far as to accompany their callers to the
elevator in a hotel or an apartment-house. Of course, if one has more
than one caller at a time, it would be discourteous to leave the others
to accompany one to the door; but, otherwise, it is rude to permit a
friend to go to the door alone, and get out as best she may.

A bride who is “At Home after November first,” should make a point of
literally staying at home for an hour or two every afternoon during
the month of November and the early part of December. She should be
dressed to receive callers, and should have some dainty refreshments
ready to serve,—tea and sandwiches or cake. After the first week of
December the bride may begin to return her calls, calling first on
those who first called upon her, and so on.

When the “at home” is a large and formal function, with engraved
invitations and all the accessories of hired waiters, an elaborate
repast, floral decorations, etc.,—such as a debutante’s coming out, a
wedding reception, or a reception to celebrate a wedding anniversary,
and other large entertainments of this order,—an after-call is
obligatory. But an ordinary “at home” does not demand another call,
for instance, the reception or “days” a bride has on her return from
her wedding trip, or when she is settled in her new home; or a tea or
“days” for which a hostess informally sends the invitations written or
engraved on her visiting cards, and receives with little ceremony and
serves only a modest menu. On the contrary, the hostess owes a return
call to all who attend; and only those who were invited, but were
unable to be present, are in debt to her.

The length of time proper for one to stay at an “at home” depends
on circumstances. It is always a compliment to one’s hostess to
make a long visit at “a day”, for it implies that one is having a
pleasant time; but nobody should stay long enough to be a burden on
the hostess’s hospitality, or to detain her from her other guests. If
one finds that she does not know any one present, or if she is not
introduced to a congenial person with whom she can have a pleasant
chat, it would be wise for her to leave after a conventional ten or
fifteen minutes’ call.

The calling code demands that soon after a second caller is announced,
the caller who was first present shall take leave of the hostess. The
reason for this rule is obvious: visitor number one has already had
a little time of uninterrupted _tête-à-tête_ with the hostess before
visitor number two appeared, and he or she should generously retire
first, so that visitor number two may have the same privilege. But
while this is the law, it depends somewhat on circumstances whether it
is always carried out. If the first caller is an intimate friend of
the hostess, and has come to have a long informal talk with her, and
the second caller is merely a formal visitor whose obvious intention
is to make a ceremonious visit, then the first comer may, with perfect
propriety, outstay the other; or if the hostess has particularly asked
the former to remain until after the latter goes, he may do so, and, of
course, if the first visitor has come for some special reason, and the
visitor who is announced later interrupts an important conversation,
which, for business or other reasons, should be continued, the former
is naturally justified in transgressing the calling code. All things
being equal, however, it is the place of the first comer to be the
first goer; and one must have a very good excuse for outstaying a
caller who comes later.

Guests who are invited to attend one large reception which is given for
the express purpose of introducing a young woman into society, should
make a call after the reception, but if the _débutante_ is introduced
at a series of “days,” the callers need call but once, on one of the
“days.”

An invitation to any kind of “day” or reception demands a card from
a person who is unable to attend the function; and the card should
be sent on the day of the reception, even if the invitation to the
function has been already answered, and even if an after-call is in
order.

When one calls on an acquaintance who is staying with a relative, the
caller should ask for the latter (the hostess), even if she does not
know her, and she should leave one of her own and one of her husband’s
cards for her, as well as one of each for her friend. It is not
obligatory to leave two of her husband’s cards for each woman. Even
in the most formal visiting, it is optional whether one leaves one or
two cards. Probably the hostess will excuse herself altogether; but the
caller must show her the courtesy of asking for her.

In making a call it is proper to give one’s card to the servant who
opens the door, if it is not a regular reception day; but on such an
occasion the card should be left either in the dressing-room or on the
hall table in passing out.

In making a formal call ten minutes is quite long enough to stay.

When one is returning visits and driving, it would be in very bad taste
to have the coachman get off his box and take the card to the door. It
is the woman’s place to deliver her card in person, unless she has a
footman to attend to it for her.

In making an evening call a man should appear about half-past eight,
and remain an hour. Even if his visit is to the daughter, he should ask
for her mother.

It is quite proper, when making calls with a friend, for one to write
her name in pencil on her friend’s card, if she has no card of her own
with her.

        in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon:  and all their
        kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death.
011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children
        of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
        they took all in battle.
011:020 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against
        Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them,
        that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:021 Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the
        hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from
        all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country
        of Israel:  Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
011:022 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children
        of Israel:  only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,
        did some remain.
011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh
        spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance
        to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
        The land had rest from war.
012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
        Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward
        the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,
        and all the Arabah eastward:
012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead,
        even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
012:003 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to
        the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way
        to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
012:004 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,
        who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
012:005 and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
012:006 Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:
        and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to
        the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
012:007 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children
        of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in
        the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir;
        and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession
        according to their divisions;
012:008 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,
        and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South;
        the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
012:009 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
012:010 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
012:011 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
012:012 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
012:013 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
012:014 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
012:015 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
012:016 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
012:017 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
012:018 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
012:019 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
012:020 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
012:021 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
012:022 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
012:023 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim
        in Gilgal, one;
012:024 the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.
013:001 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said
        to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there
        remains yet very much land to be possessed.
013:002 This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of
        the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
013:003 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border
        of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites;
        the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites,
        the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites;
        also the Avvim,
013:004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border
        of the Amorites;
013:005 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,
        from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;
013:006 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to
        Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive
        out from before the children of Israel:  only allot you it
        to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
013:008 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,
        which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses
        the servant of Yahweh gave them:
013:009 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all
        the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
013:010 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned
        in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
013:011 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
        and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
013:012 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim);
        for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.
013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,
        nor the Maacathites:  but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst
        of Israel to this day.
013:014 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance,
        as he spoke to him.
013:015 Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according
        to their families.
013:016 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
        of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
        and all the plain by Medeba;
013:017 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,
        and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,
013:018 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
013:019 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount
        of the valley,
013:020 and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,
013:021 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck
        with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur,
        and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel kill with the sword among the rest of their slain.
013:023 The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border
        [of it]. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben
        according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:024 Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,
        according to their families.
013:025 Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,
        and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that
        is before Rabbah;
013:026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
        to the border of Debir;
013:027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,
        and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part
        of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according
        to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:029 Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:
        and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families.
013:030 Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are
        in Bashan, sixty cities:
013:031 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir
        the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
        of Machir according to their families.
013:032 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains
        of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
013:033 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
014:001 These are the inheritances which the children of Israel
        took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
        and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        distributed to them,
014:002 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,
        for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and
        the half-tribe beyond the Jordan:  but to the Levites he gave
        no inheritance among them.
014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
        and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land,
        save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs of it for their
        livestock and for their substance.
014:005 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;
        and they divided the land.
014:006 Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:
        and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
        You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God
        concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.
014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent
        me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in my heart.
014:008 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.
014:009 Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and
        to your children forever, because you have wholly followed
        Yahweh my God.
014:010 Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,
        these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke
        this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness:
        and now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:
        as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
        and to go out and to come in.
014:012 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,
        and cities great and fortified:  it may be that Yahweh will
        be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
014:013 Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
014:014 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly
        followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
014:015 Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;
        [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim.
        The land had rest from war.
015:001 The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
        families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness
        of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
015:002 Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,
        from the bay that looks southward;
015:003 and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed
        along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea,
        and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned
        about to Karka;
015:004 and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook
        of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea:
        this shall be your south border.
015:005 The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.
        The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea
        at the end of the Jordan;
015:006 and the border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by
        the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone
        of Bohan the son of Reuben;
015:007 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against
        the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river;
        and the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh,
        and the goings out of it were at En Rogel;
015:008 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom
        to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem);
        and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies
        before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost
        part of the valley of Rephaim northward;
015:009 and the border extended from the top of the mountain
        to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to
        the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim);
015:010 and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,
        and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north
        (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh,
        and passed along by Timnah;
015:011 and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;
        and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along
        to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings
        out of the border were at the sea.
015:012 The west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it].
        This is the border of the children of Judah round about
        according to their families.
015:013 To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children
        of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua,
        even Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron).
015:014 Caleb drove out there the three sons of Anak:  Sheshai, and Ahiman,
        and Talmai, the children of Anak.
015:015 He went up there against the inhabitants of Debir:
        now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
015:016 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
015:017 Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
015:018 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said, What would you?
015:019 She said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.
015:021 The uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel,
        and Eder, and Jagur,
015:022 and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
015:023 and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
015:025 Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth, Hezron (the same is Hazor),
015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
015:027 and Hazar Gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth Pelet,
015:028 and Hazar Shual, and Beersheba, and Biziothiah,
015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
015:030 and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
015:031 and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
015:032 and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon:  all the cities
        are twenty-nine, with their villages.
015:033 In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
015:034 and Zanoah, and En Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
015:036 and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages.
015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal Gad,
015:038 and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
015:040 and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,
015:041 and Gederoth, Beth Dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah;
        sixteen cities with their villages.
015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
015:043 and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
015:044 and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities
        with their villages.
015:045 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
015:046 from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod,
        with their villages.
015:047 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and
        its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border [of it].
015:048 In the hill country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
015:049 and Dannah, and Kiriath Sannah (the same is Debir),
015:050 and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
015:051 and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
015:053 and Janim, and Beth Tappuah, and Aphekah,
015:054 and Humtah, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior;
        nine cities with their villages.
015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,
015:056 and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
015:057 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
015:058 Halhul, Beth Zur, and Gedor,
015:059 and Maarath, and Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities
        with their villages.
015:060 Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah;
        two cities with their villages.
015:061 In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
015:062 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities
        with their villages.
015:063 As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
        of Judah couldn't drive them out:  but the Jebusites dwell
        with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
016:001 The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan
        at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,
        even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill
        country to Bethel;
016:002 and it went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border
        of the Archites to Ataroth;
016:003 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites,
        to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to Gezer;
        and the goings out of it were at the sea.
016:004 The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
016:005 The border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was [thus]: the border of their inheritance eastward
        was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper;
016:006 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north;
        and the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh,
        and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
016:007 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah,
        and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
016:008 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook
        of Kanah; and the goings out of it were at the sea.
        This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
        according to their families;
016:009 together with the cities which were set apart for the children
        of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children
        of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
016:010 They didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer:
        but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day,
        and are become servants to do forced labor.
017:001 [This] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was
        the firstborn of Joseph.  As for Machir the firstborn
        of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
017:002 So [the lot] was for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families:  for the children of Abiezer,
        and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,
        and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher,
        and for the children of Shemida:  these were the male children
        of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,
        the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons,
        but daughters:  and these are the names of his daughters:
        Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
017:004 They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
        the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh commanded
        Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:
        therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them
        an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
017:005 There fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead
        and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
017:006 because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons.
        The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
017:007 The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is
        before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand,
        to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.
017:008 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on
        the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
017:009 The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook:
        these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh:
        and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook,
        and the goings out of it were at the sea:
017:010 southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north,
        and to Issachar on the east.
017:011 Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth Shean and its towns,
        and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns,
        and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't drive out [the inhabitants
        of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
017:013 It happened, when the children of Israel had grown strong,
        that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn't
        utterly drive them out.
017:014 The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you
        given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I
        am a great people, because hitherto Yahweh has blessed me?
017:015 Joshua said to them, If you are a great people, go up to the forest,
        and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites
        and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too
        narrow for you.
017:016 The children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us:
        and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have
        chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth Shean and its towns,
        and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
017:017 Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power;
        you shall not have one lot only:
017:018 but the hill country shall be yours; for though it is a forest,
        you shall cut it down, and the goings out of it shall be yours;
        for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have
        chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
018:001 The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there:
        and the land was subdued before them.
018:002 There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet divided their inheritance.
018:003 Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go
        in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you?
018:004 Appoint for you three men of each tribe:  and I will send them,
        and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe
        it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.
018:005 They shall divide it into seven portions:  Judah shall abide
        in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their border on the north.
018:006 You shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring
        [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you
        here before Yahweh our God.
018:007 For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood
        of Yahweh is their inheritance:  and Gad and Reuben and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance
        beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of
        Yahweh gave them.
018:008 The men arose, and went:  and Joshua charged those who went
        to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,
        and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots
        for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.
018:009 The men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came
        to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
018:010 Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh:
        and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.
018:011 The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families:  and the border of their lot went
        out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
018:012 Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan;
        and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north,
        and went up through the hill country westward; and the goings
        out of it were at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
018:013 The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz
        (the same is Bethel), southward; and the border went down
        to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south
        of Beth Horon the lower.
018:014 The border extended [there], and turned about on the west
        quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before
        Beth Horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath Baal
        (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah:
        this was the west quarter.
018:015 The south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath Jearim;
        and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring
        of the waters of Nephtoah;
018:016 and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain
        that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is
        in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to
        the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward,
        and went down to En Rogel;
018:017 and it extended northward, and went out at En Shemesh, and went
        out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim;
        and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
018:018 and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward,
        and went down to the Arabah;
018:019 and the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward;
        and the goings out of the border were at the north
        bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan:
        this was the south border.
018:020 The Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter.
        This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin,
        by the borders of it round about, according to their families.
018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Beth Hoglah,
        and Emek Keziz,
018:022 and Beth Arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
018:023 and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
018:024 and Chephar Ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities
        with their villages:
018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
018:026 and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
018:027 and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
018:028 and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath,
        [and] Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.
        This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according
        to their families.
019:001 The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe
        of the children of Simeon according to their families:
        and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance
        of the children of Judah.
019:002 They had for their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
019:003 and Hazar Shual, and Balah, and Ezem,
019:004 and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
019:005 and Ziklag, and Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar Susah,
019:006 and Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:
019:007 Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:
019:008 and all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South.  This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
019:009 Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance
        of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children
        of Judah was too much for them:  therefore the children
        of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
019:010 The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
        to their families; and the border of their inheritance
        was to Sarid;
019:011 and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached
        to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
019:012 and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to
        the border of Chisloth Tabor; and it went out to Daberath,
        and went up to Japhia;
019:013 and from there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin;
        and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah;
019:014 and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon;
        and the goings out of it were at the valley of Iphtah El;
019:015 and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
        twelve cities with their villages.
019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:017 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children
        of Issachar according to their families.
019:018 Their border was to Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

019:021 and Remeth, and Engannim, and En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez,
019:022 and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh;
        and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.
019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:024 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families.
019:025 Their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
019:026 and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to
        Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;
019:027 and it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached
        to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek
        and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
019:028 and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon;
019:029 and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre;
        and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out of it
        were at the sea by the region of Achzib;
019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:  twenty-two cities
        with their villages.
019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:032 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.
019:033 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim,
        and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the goings out
        of it were at the Jordan;
019:034 and the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out
        from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south,
        and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan
        toward the sunrise.
019:035 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
        and Chinnereth,
019:036 and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
019:037 and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En Hazor,
019:038 Iron, and Migdal El, Horem, and Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.
019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
        according to their families, the cities with their villages.
019:040 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families.
019:041 The border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,
019:042 and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah,

019:045 and Jehud, and Bene Berak, and Gath Rimmon,
019:046 and Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
019:047 The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them;
        for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem,
        and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.
019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.
019:049 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance
        by the borders of it; and the children of Israel gave an
        inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
019:050 according to the commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city
        which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim;
        and he built the city, and lived therein.
019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
        the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes
        of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot
        in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.
        So they made an end of dividing the land.
020:001 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities
        of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,
020:003 that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly [and]
        unawares may flee there:  and they shall be to you for a refuge
        from the avenger of blood.
020:004 He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at
        the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause
        in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall
        take him into the city to them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.
020:005 If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck
        his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him before.
020:006 He shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest
        that shall be in those days:  then shall the manslayer return,
        and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city
        from whence he fled.
020:007 They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali,
        and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba
        (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
020:008 Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer
        in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
        and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
        in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
020:009 These were the appointed cities for all the children
        of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them,
        that whoever kills any person unwittingly might flee there,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood
        before the congregation.
021:001 Then came near the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites
        to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,
        and to the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of
        the children of Israel;
021:002 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in,
        with the suburbs of it for our livestock.
021:003 The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities
        with their suburbs.
021:004 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:
        and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
021:005 The rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
021:006 The children of Gershon had by lot out of the families
        of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher,
        and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe
        of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
021:007 The children of Merari according to their families had
        out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,
        and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
021:008 The children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities
        with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.
021:009 They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah,
        and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities
        which are [here] mentioned by name:
021:010 and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families
        of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi;
        for theirs was the first lot.
021:011 They gave them Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak
        (the same is Hebron), in the hill country of Judah,
        with the suburbs of it round about it.
021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages of it, gave they
        to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
021:013 To the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Libnah with its suburbs,
021:014 and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
021:015 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
021:016 and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs,
        [and] Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of
        those two tribes.
021:017 Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs,
        Geba with its suburbs,
021:018 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests,
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:020 The families of the children of Kohath, the Levites,
        even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
021:021 They gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country
        of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer
        with its suburbs,
021:022 and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth Horon with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:023 Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs,
        Gibbethon with its suburbs,
021:024 Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
021:025 Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs,
        and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
021:026 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children
        of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
021:027 To the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
        out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan
        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
        and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
021:028 Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs,
        Daberath with its suburbs,
021:029 Jarmuth with its suburbs, En Gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
021:030 Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs,
        Abdon with its suburbs,
021:031 Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
021:032 Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammothdor with
        its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
021:034 To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites,
        out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs,
        and Kartah with its suburbs,
021:035 Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
021:036 Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz
        with its suburbs,
021:037 Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs;
        four cities.
021:038 Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs,
        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
021:039 Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs;
        four cities in all.
021:040 All [these were] the cities of the children of Merari according
        to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites;
        and their lot was twelve cities.
021:041 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession
        of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities
        with their suburbs.
021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
        thus it was with all these cities.
021:043 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give
        to their fathers; and they possessed it, and lived therein.
021:044 Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore
        to their fathers:  and there stood not a man of all their
        enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies
        into their hand.
021:045 There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had
        spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
022:002 and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all
        that I commanded you:
022:003 you have not left your brothers these many days to this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your God.
022:004 Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke
        to them:  therefore now turn you, and get you to your tents,
        to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant
        of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.
022:005 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses
        the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
        and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went
        to their tents.
022:007 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        [inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half gave
        Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward;
        moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents,
        he blessed them,
022:008 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents,
        and with very much livestock, with silver, and with gold,
        and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing:
        divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.
022:009 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel
        out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land
        of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned,
        according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
022:010 When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land
        of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan,
        a great altar to look on.
022:011 The children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan,
        in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains
        to the children of Israel.
022:012 When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
        of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh,
        to go up against them to war.
022:013 The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
022:014 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for
        each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them
        head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.
022:015 They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad,
        and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead,
        and they spoke with them, saying,
022:016 Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass
        is this that you have committed against the God of Israel,
        to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you
        have built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?
022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we
        have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came
        a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,
022:018 that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? and it
        will be, seeing you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow
        he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
022:019 However, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh,
        in which Yahweh's tent dwells, and take possession among us:
        but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us,
        in building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.
022:020 Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing,
        and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
        didn't perish alone in his iniquity.
022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
        the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads
        of the thousands of Israel,
022:022 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows;
        and Israel he shall know:  if it be in rebellion, or if in
        trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),
022:023 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh;
        or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal offering,
        or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings thereon,
        let Yahweh himself require it;
022:024 and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this,
        [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might
        speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Yahweh,
        the God of Israel?
022:025 for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you,
        you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion
        in Yahweh:  so might your children make our children cease
        from fearing Yahweh.
022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
022:027 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our
        generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not tell
        our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.
022:028 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us
        or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say,
        Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;
        but it is a witness between us and you.
022:029 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh,
        and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar
        for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice,
        besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tent.
022:030 When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation,
        even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him,
        heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children
        of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.
022:031 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children
        of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children
        of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,
        because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh:
        now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the
        hand of Yahweh.
022:032 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children
        of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan,
        to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
022:033 The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
        Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them
        to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben
        and the children of Gad lived.
022:034 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
        the altar [Ed]: For, [said they], it is a witness between us
        that Yahweh is God.
023:001 It happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest
        to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua
        was old and well stricken in years;
023:002 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for
        their heads, and for their judges and for their officers,
        and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years:
023:003 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all
        these nations because of you; for Yahweh your God, he it
        is that has fought for you.
023:004 Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain,
        to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great
        sea toward the going down of the sun.
023:005 Yahweh your God, he will thrust them out from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess
        their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
023:006 Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn
        aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
023:007 that you not come among these nations, these that remain
        among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods,
        nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow
        down yourselves to them;
023:008 but cleave to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day.
023:009 For Yahweh has driven out from before you great nations and strong:
        but as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Yahweh your God,
        he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to you.
023:011 Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love
        Yahweh your God.
023:012 Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant
        of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make
        marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;
023:013 know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive
        these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be
        a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides,
        and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this
        good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:014 Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
        and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
        that not one thing has failed of all the good things which
        Yahweh your God spoke concerning you; all are happen to you,
        not one thing has failed of it.
023:015 It shall happen, that as all the good things are come on you
        of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so will Yahweh bring
        on you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from
        off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
023:016 When you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods,
        and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Yahweh
        be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he has given to you.
024:001 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
        and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads,
        and for their judges, and for their officers; and they
        presented themselves before God.
024:002 Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River,
        even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor:
        and they served other gods.
024:003 I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him
        throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed,
        and gave him Isaac.
024:004 I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:  and I gave to Esau Mount Seir,
        to possess it:  and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
024:005 I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did in the midst of it:  and afterward I
        brought you out.
024:006 I brought your fathers out of Egypt:  and you came to the sea;
        and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots
        and with horsemen to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
024:007 When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between
        you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them,
        and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt:
        and you lived in the wilderness many days.
024:008 I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond
        the Jordan:  and they fought with you; and I gave them into
        your hand, and you possessed their land; and I destroyed them
        from before you.
024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought
        against Israel:  and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor
        to curse you;
024:010 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
        so I delivered you out of his hand.
024:011 You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho:  and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite,
        and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
024:012 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,
        even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword,
        nor with your bow.
024:013 I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities
        which you didn't build, and you dwell therein; of vineyards
        and olive groves which you didn't plant do you eat.
024:014 Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
        and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River,
        and in Egypt; and serve you Yahweh.
024:015 If it seem evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose you this day whom
        you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
        that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,
        in whose land you dwell:  but as for me and my house,
        we will serve Yahweh.
024:016 The people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh,
        to serve other gods;
024:017 for Yahweh our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers
        up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples
        through the midst of whom we passed;
024:018 and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites
        who lived in the land:  therefore we also will serve Yahweh;
        for he is our God.
024:019 Joshua said to the people, You can't serve Yahweh;
        for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your disobedience nor your sins.
024:020 If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will
        turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he has
        done you good.
024:021 The people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.
024:022 Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against
        yourselves that you have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him.
        They said, We are witnesses.
024:023 Now therefore put away, [said he], the foreign gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
024:024 The people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God will we serve,
        and to his voice will we listen.
024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
024:026 Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God;
        and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak
        that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.
024:027 Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
        a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh
        which he spoke to us:  it shall be therefore a witness against you,
        lest you deny your God.
024:028 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
024:029 It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
        the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
024:030 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,
        which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
024:031 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days
        of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work
        of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.
024:032 The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel
        of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor
        the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money:
        and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
024:033 Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill
        of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill
        country of Ephraim.
Book 07 Judges
001:001 It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel
        asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall go up for us first against
        the Canaanites, to fight against them?
001:002 Yahweh said, Judah shall go up:  behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand.
001:003 Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
        that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise
        will go with you into your lot.  So Simeon went with him.
001:004 Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the
        Perizzites into their hand:  and they struck of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men.
001:005 They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him,
        and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
001:006 But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,
        and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
001:007 Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their
        great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table:
        as I have done, so God has requited me."  They brought him
        to Jerusalem, and he died there.
001:008 The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
001:009 Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South,
        and in the lowland.
001:010 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they
        struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
001:011 From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir.
        (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)
001:012 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
001:013 Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
001:014 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;
        and Caleb said to her, What would you?
001:015 She said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
        Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
001:016 The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah
        into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad;
        and they went and lived with the people.
001:017 Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the
        Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        The name of the city was called Hormah.
001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon
        with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.
001:019 Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out [the inhabitants of]
        the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants
        of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
001:020 They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken:
        and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.
001:021 The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who
        inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children
        of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
001:022 The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel;
        and Yahweh was with them.
001:023 The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel.  (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.)
001:024 The watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city,
        and we will deal kindly with you.
001:025 He shown them the entrance into the city; and they struck
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go
        and all his family.
001:026 The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
        and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it
        to this day.
001:027 Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth Shean and
        its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and
        its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns;
        but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
001:028 It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put
        the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly
        drive them out.
001:029 Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer;
        but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
001:030 Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
        inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them,
        and became subject to forced labor.
001:031 Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants
        of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah,
        nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
001:032 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land; for they did not drive them out.
001:033 Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived
        among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
        nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath
        became subject to forced labor.
001:034 The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country;
        for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
001:035 but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon,
        and in Shaalbim:  yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,
        so that they became subject to forced labor.
001:036 The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim,
        from the rock, and upward.
002:001 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim.
        He said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought
        you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said,
        I will never break my covenant with you:
002:002 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land;
        you shall break down their altars.  But you have not listened
        to my voice:  why have you done this?
002:003 Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you;
        but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare to you.
002:004 It happened, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words
        to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up
        their voice, and wept.
002:005 They called the name of that place Bochim:  and they sacrificed
        there to Yahweh.
002:006 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel
        went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
002:007 The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen
        all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.
002:008 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one
        hundred ten years old.
002:009 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north
        of the mountain of Gaash.
002:010 Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, who didn't
        know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.
002:011 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
002:012 and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,
        of the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed
        themselves down to them:  and they provoked Yahweh to anger.
002:013 They forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
002:014 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered
        them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them;
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
002:015 Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them
        for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them:
        and they were sore distressed.
002:016 Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand
        of those who despoiled them.
002:017 Yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they played the
        prostitute after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them:
        they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their
        fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh;
        [but] they didn't do so.
002:018 When Yahweh raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge,
        and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
        of the judge:  for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning
        by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them.
002:019 But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back,
        and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following
        other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn't
        cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
002:020 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said,
        Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;
002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them
        of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
002:022 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their fathers did
        keep it, or not.
002:023 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily;
        neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
003:001 Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all
        the wars of Canaan;
003:002 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,
        to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:
003:003 [namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon,
        from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
003:004 They were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded
        their fathers by Moses.
003:005 The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites,
        and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites:
003:006 and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
003:007 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals
        and the Asheroth.
003:008 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia:
        and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.
003:009 When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
        up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them,
        even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
003:010 The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel;
        and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim
        king of Mesopotamia into his hand:  and his hand prevailed
        against Cushan Rishathaim.
003:011 The land had rest forty years.  Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
003:012 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab
        against Israel, because they had done that which was evil
        in the sight of Yahweh.
003:013 He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek;
        and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city
        of palm trees.
003:014 The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
003:015 But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
        them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
        a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him
        to Eglon the king of Moab.
003:016 Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length;
        and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.
003:017 He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab:  now Eglon was
        a very fat man.
003:018 When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away
        the people who bore the tribute.
003:019 But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal,
        and said, I have a secret errand to you, king.  He said,
        Keep silence.  All who stood by him went out from him.
003:020 Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool
        upper room.  Ehud said, I have a message from God to you.
        He arose out of his seat.
003:021 Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his body:
003:022 and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body;
        and it came out behind.
003:023 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors
        of the upper room on him, and locked them.
003:024 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw,
        and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said,
        Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
003:025 They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn't open
        the doors of the upper room:  therefore they took the key,
        and opened [them], and behold, their lord was fallen down dead
        on the earth.
003:026 Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries,
        and escaped to Seirah.
003:027 It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in
        the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the hill country, and he before them.
003:028 He said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your
        enemies the Moabites into your hand.  They went down after him,
        and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites,
        and didn't allow a man to pass over.
003:029 They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men,
        every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped
        not a man.
003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.
        The land had rest eighty years.
003:031 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck
        of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad:
        and he also saved Israel.
004:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.
004:002 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera,
        who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
004:003 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh:  for he had nine hundred
        chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed
        the children of Israel.
004:004 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time.
004:005 She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel
        in the hill country of Ephraim:  and the children of Israel
        came up to her for judgment.
004:006 She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, Hasn't Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, commanded, [saying], Go and draw to Mount Tabor,
        and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun?
004:007 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain
        of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into your hand.
004:008 Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go;
        but if you will not go with me, I will not go.
004:009 She said, I will surely go with you:  notwithstanding, the journey
        that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh
        will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.  Deborah arose,
        and went with Barak to Kedesh.
004:010 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh;
        and there went up ten thousand men at his feet:
        and Deborah went up with him.
004:011 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites,
        even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses,
        and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim,
        which is by Kedesh.
004:012 They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
        to Mount Tabor.
004:013 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
        chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him,
        from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
004:014 Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has
        delivered Sisera into your hand; hasn't Yahweh gone out before you?
        So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand
        men after him.
004:015 Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army,
        with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted
        from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army,
        to Harosheth of the Gentiles:  and all the army of Sisera
        fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
004:017 However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael
        the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin
        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
004:018 Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord,
        turn in to me; don't be afraid.  He came in to her into the tent,
        and she covered him with a rug.
004:019 He said to her, Please give me a little water to drink;
        for I am thirsty.  She opened a bottle of milk, and gave
        him drink, and covered him.
004:020 He said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be,
        when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there
        any man here? that you shall say, No.
004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer
        in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin
        into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground;
        for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
004:022 Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
        and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.
        He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent
        peg was in his temples.
004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before
        the children of Israel.
004:024 The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more
        against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed
        Jabin king of Canaan.
005:001 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
005:002 Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people
        offered themselves willingly, be blessed, Yahweh!
005:003 Hear, you kings!  Give ear, you princes!  I, [even] I,
        will sing to Yahweh.  I will sing praise to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel.
005:004 Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, when you marched out
        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
        Yes, the clouds dropped water.
005:005 The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, even Sinai,
        at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
        the highways were unoccupied.  The travelers walked through byways.
005:007 The rulers ceased in Israel.  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
        Until I arose a mother in Israel.
005:008 They chose new gods.  Then war was in the gates.  Was there
        a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered
        themselves willingly among the people.  Bless Yahweh!
005:010 Tell [of it], you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit
        on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.
005:011 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing
        water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts
        of Yahweh, [Even] the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
        Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah!  Awake, awake, utter a song!
        Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.
005:013 Then a remnant of the nobles [and] the people came down.
        Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.
005:014 Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you,
        Benjamin, among your peoples.  Governors come down out of Machir.
        Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zebulun.
005:015 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.  As was Issachar,
        so was Barak.  They rushed into the valley at his feet.
        By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.
005:016 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling
        for the flocks?  At the watercourses of Reuben There were
        great searchings of heart.
005:017 Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.  Why did Dan remain in ships?
        Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.
005:018 Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths;
        Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
005:019 The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at
        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.  They took no plunder of silver.
005:020 From the sky the stars fought.  From their courses,
        they fought against Sisera.
005:021 The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river,
        the river Kishon.  My soul, march on with strength.
005:022 Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings,
        the prancings of their strong ones.
005:023 Curse Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh.  Curse bitterly
        its inhabitants, because they didn't come to help Yahweh,
        to help Yahweh against the mighty.
005:024 Jael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Heber the Kenite;
        blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
005:025 He asked for water.  She gave him milk.  She brought him butter
        in a lordly dish.
005:026 She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to
        the workmen's hammer.  With the hammer she struck Sisera.
        She struck through his head.  Yes, she pierced and struck
        through his temples.
005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.  At her feet he bowed,
        he fell.  Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
005:028 Through the window she looked out, and cried:  Sisera's mother
        looked through the lattice.  Why is his chariot so long in coming?
        Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?
005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,
005:030 Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?  A lady,
        two ladies to every man; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,
        A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments
        embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
005:031 So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love
        him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength.
        The land had rest forty years.
006:001 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of
        Midian seven years.
006:002 The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of
        Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are
        in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
006:003 So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
        and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came
        up against them;
006:004 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase
        of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance
        in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
006:005 For they came up with their livestock and their tents;
        they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their
        camels were without number:  and they came into the land
        to destroy it.
006:006 Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children
        of Israel cried to Yahweh.
006:007 It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh
        because of Midian,
006:008 that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel:
        and he said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I
        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
        the house of bondage;
006:009 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
        and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them
        out from before you, and gave you their land;
006:010 and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not
        fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.
        But you have not listened to my voice.
006:011 The angel of Yahweh came, and sat under the oak which
        was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite:
        and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress,
        to hide it from the Midianites.
006:012 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him, and said to him,
        Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor.
006:013 Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then
        has all this happened to us? and where are all his wondrous
        works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Yahweh
        bring us up from Egypt? but now Yahweh has cast us off,
        and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
006:014 Yahweh looked at him, and said, Go in this your might,
        and save Israel from the hand of Midian:  have not I sent you?
006:015 He said to him, Oh, Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold,
        my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least
        in my father's house.
006:016 Yahweh said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall
        strike the Midianites as one man.
006:017 He said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight,
        then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
006:018 Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out
        my present, and lay it before you.  He said, I will wait
        until you come again.
006:019 Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
        of an ephah of meal:  the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
        the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak,
        and presented it.
006:020 The angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
        cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.
        He did so.
006:021 Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was
        in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes;
        and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh
        and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Yahweh departed
        out of his sight.
006:022 Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said,
        Alas, Lord Yahweh! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh
        face to face.
006:023 Yahweh said to him, Peace be to you; don't be afraid:
        you shall not die.
006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it
        Yahweh is Peace{or, Yahweh Shalom}: to this day it is still
        in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
006:025 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him,
        Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven years old,
        and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has,
        and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
006:026 and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold,
        in the orderly manner, and take the second bull, and offer
        a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you
        shall cut down.
006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh
        had spoken to him:  and it happened, because he feared his
        father's household and the men of the city, so that he could
        not do it by day, that he did it by night.
006:028 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
        the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut
        down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on
        the altar that was built.
006:029 They said one to another, Who has done this thing?
        When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son
        of Joash has done this thing.
006:030 Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son,
        that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal,
        and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
006:031 Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend
        for Baal?  Or will you save him? he who will contend for him,
        let him be put to death while [it is yet] morning:
        if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has
        broken down his altar.
006:032 Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
        contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.
006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children
        of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over,
        and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
006:034 But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet;
        and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
006:035 He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were
        gathered together after him:  and he sent messengers to Asher,
        and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
006:036 Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand,
        as you have spoken,
006:037 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor;
        if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground,
        then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand,
        as you have spoken.
006:038 It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed
        the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece,
        a bowl full of water.
006:039 Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me,
        and I will speak but this once:  Please let me make a trial
        just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on
        the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.
006:040 God did so that night:  for it was dry on the fleece only,
        and there was dew on all the ground.
007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him,
        rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod:
        and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them,
        by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
007:002 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are
        too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand,
        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand
        has saved me.
007:003 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is
        fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.
        There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there
        remained ten thousand.
007:004 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them
        down to the water, and I will try them for you there:
        and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you,
        the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you,
        This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
007:005 So he brought down the people to the water:  and Yahweh said
        to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue,
        as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise everyone
        who bows down on his knees to drink.
007:006 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
        was three hundred men:  but all the rest of the people bowed
        down on their knees to drink water.
007:007 Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped
        will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand;
        and let all the people go every man to his place.
007:008 So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets;
        and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent,
        but retained the three hundred men:  and the camp of Midian
        was beneath him in the valley.
007:009 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you
        down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
007:010 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant
        down to the camp:
007:011 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall
        your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp.
        Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost
        part of the armed men who were in the camp.
007:012 The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude;
        and their camels were without number, as the sand which is
        on the seashore for multitude.
007:013 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream
        to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream;
        and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp
        of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell,
        and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.
007:014 His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword
        of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:  into his hand
        God has delivered Midian, and all the army.
007:015 It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,
        and the interpretation of it, that he worshiped; and he returned
        into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has
        delivered into your hand the army of Midian.
007:016 He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put
        into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers,
        with torches within the pitchers.
007:017 He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise:  and behold,
        when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that,
        as I do, so shall you do.
007:018 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow
        you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say,
        For Yahweh and for Gideon.
007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him,
        came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning
        of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch:
        and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers
        that were in their hands.
007:020 The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers,
        and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets
        in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried,
        The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.
007:021 They stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.
007:022 They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every
        man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army;
        and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah,
        as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.
007:023 The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out
        of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
007:024 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country
        of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before
        them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
        So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took
        the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
007:025 They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they
        killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian:
        and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon
        beyond the Jordan.
008:001 The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you
        didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian?  They did
        chide with him sharply.
008:002 He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you?
        Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer?
008:003 God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb:  and what was I able to do in comparison with you?
        Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
008:004 Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
008:005 He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread
        to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am
        pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
008:006 The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
        now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?
008:007 Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna
        into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns
        of the wilderness and with briers.
008:008 He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner;
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of
        Succoth had answered.
008:009 He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again
        in peace, I will break down this tower.
008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them,
        about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army
        of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty
        thousand men who drew sword.
008:011 Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents
        on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army;
        for the army was secure.
008:012 Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them;
        and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna,
        and confused all the army.
008:013 Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from
        the ascent of Heres.
008:014 He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him:
        and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders
        of it, seventy-seven men.
008:015 He came to the men of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna,
        concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands
        of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give
        bread to your men who are weary?
008:016 He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness
        and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
008:017 He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
008:018 Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom you killed at Tabor?  They answered, As you are,
        so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
008:019 He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother:
        as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would
        not kill you.
008:020 He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them.
        But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he feared,
        because he was yet a youth.
008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us;
        for as the man is, so is his strength.  Gideon arose,
        and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that
        were on their camels' necks.
008:022 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us,
        both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you
        have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
008:023 Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall
        my son rule over you:  Yahweh shall rule over you.
008:024 Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you,
        that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil.
        (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
008:025 They answered, We will willingly give them.  They spread a garment,
        and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil.
008:026 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand
        and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, besides the crescents,
        and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on
        the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about
        their camels' necks.
008:027 Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah:
        and all Israel played the prostitute after it there;
        and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
008:028 So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they
        lifted up their heads no more.  The land had rest forty years
        in the days of Gideon.
008:029 Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
008:030 Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body;
        for he had many wives.
008:031 His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son,
        and he named him Abimelech.
008:032 Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried
        in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
008:033 It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
        Israel turned again, and played the prostitute after the Baals,
        and made Baal Berith their god.
008:034 The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God,
        who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies
        on every side;
008:035 neither shown they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
        [who is] Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
        shown to Israel.
009:001 Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his
        mother's brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family
        of the house of his mother's father, saying,
009:002 Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is
        better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are
        seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?
        Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
009:003 His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men
        of Shechem all these words:  and their hearts inclined
        to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
009:004 They gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of
        Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows,
        who followed him.
009:005 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers
        the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone:
        but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
        for he hid himself.
009:006 All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together,
        and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king,
        by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
009:007 When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top
        of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried,
        and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God
        may listen to you.
009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them;
        and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.
009:009 But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness,
        with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back
        and forth over the trees?
009:010 The trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
009:011 But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness,
        and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
009:012 The trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
009:013 The vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers
        God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
009:014 Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you,
        and reign over us.
009:015 The bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me
        king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade;
        and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour
        the cedars of Lebanon.
009:016 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously,
        in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt
        well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him
        according to the deserving of his hands
009:017 (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life,
        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
009:018 and you are risen up against my father's house this day,
        and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone,
        and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant,
        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
009:019 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal
        and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech,
        and let him also rejoice in you:
009:020 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour
        the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come
        out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
        and devour Abimelech.
009:021 Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there,
        for fear of Abimelech his brother.
009:022 Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
009:023 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;
        and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
009:024 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come,
        and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother,
        who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened
        his hands to kill his brothers.
009:025 The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains,
        and they robbed all who came along that way by them:
        and it was told Abimelech.
009:026 Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over
        to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
009:027 They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards,
        and trod [the grapes], and held festival, and went into the house
        of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
009:028 Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,
        that we should serve him?  Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul
        his officer? serve you the men of Hamor the father of Shechem:
        but why should we serve him?
009:029 Would that this people were under my hand! then would I
        remove Abimelech.  He said to Abimelech, Increase your army,
        and come out.
009:030 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
009:031 He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the
        son of Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and behold,
        they constrain the city [to take part] against you.
009:032 Now therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you,
        and lie in wait in the field:
009:033 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up,
        you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold,
        when he and the people who are with him come out against you,
        then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.
009:034 Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night,
        and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
009:035 Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of
        the gate of the city:  and Abimelech rose up, and the people
        who were with him, from the ambush.
009:036 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
        people down from the tops of the mountains.  Zebul said to him,
        You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
009:037 Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there come people down
        by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way
        of the oak of Meonenim.
009:038 Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, that you said,
        Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this
        the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray,
        and fight with them.
009:039 Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
009:040 Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell
        many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
009:041 Abimelech lived at Arumah:  and Zebul drove out Gaal and
        his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
009:042 It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field;
        and they told Abimelech.
009:043 He took the people, and divided them into three companies,
        and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold,
        the people came forth out of the city; He rose up against them,
        and struck them.
009:044 Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward,
        and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city:
        and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field,
        and struck them.
009:045 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
        the city, and killed the people who were therein:
        and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
009:046 When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it,
        they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
009:047 It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem
        were gathered together.
009:048 Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people
        who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,
        and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up,
        and laid it on his shoulder:  and he said to the people
        who were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste,
        and do as I have done.
009:049 All the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
        and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold,
        and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the men
        of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
        and took it.
009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled
        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut
        themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.
009:052 Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew
        near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
009:053 A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head,
        and broke his skull.
009:054 Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer,
        and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say
        of me, A woman killed him.  His young man thrust him through,
        and he died.
009:055 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
        every man to his place.
009:056 Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
        to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;
009:057 and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite
        on their heads:  and on them came the curse of Jotham
        the son of Jerubbaal.
010:001 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah,
        the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in Shamir
        in the hill country of Ephraim.
010:002 He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was
        buried in Shamir.
010:003 After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged
        Israel twenty-two years.
010:004 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they
        had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day,
        which are in the land of Gilead.
010:005 Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
010:006 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
        of Yahweh, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods
        of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods
        of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines;
        and they forsook Yahweh, and didn't serve him.
010:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand
        of the children of Ammon.
010:008 They vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year:
        eighteen years [oppressed they] all the children of Israel
        that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites,
        which is in Gilead.
010:009 The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also
        against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house
        of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
010:010 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, We have
        sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God,
        and have served the Baals.
010:011 Yahweh said to the children of Israel, Didn't I save you from
        the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon,
        and from the Philistines?
010:012 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
        did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out
        of their hand.
010:013 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods:
        therefore I will save you no more.
010:014 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save
        you in the time of your distress.
010:015 The children of Israel said to Yahweh, We have sinned:
        do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us,
        we pray you, this day.
010:016 They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh;
        and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
        in Gilead.  The children of Israel assembled themselves together,
        and encamped in Mizpah.
010:018 The people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another,
        What man is he who will begin to fight against the children
        of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor,
        and he was the son of a prostitute:  and Gilead became
        the father of Jephthah.
011:002 Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up,
        they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit
        in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman.
011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob:
        and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they
        went out with him.
011:004 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made
        war against Israel.
011:005 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
        the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
011:006 and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we
        may fight with the children of Ammon.
011:007 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Didn't you hate me,
        and drive me out of my father's house? and why are you come
        to me now when you are in distress?
011:008 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we
        turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight
        with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over
        all the inhabitants of Gilead.
011:009 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home
        again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver
        them before me, shall I be your head?
011:010 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness
        between us; surely according to your word so will we do.
011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
        made him head and chief over them:  and Jephthah spoke all
        his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
011:012 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,
        saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come to me
        to fight against my land?
011:013 The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers
        of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out
        of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan:
        now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.
011:014 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;
011:015 and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah:  Israel didn't take
        away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
011:016 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went
        through the wilderness to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},
        and came to Kadesh;
011:017 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let
        me pass through your land; but the king of Edom didn't listen.
        In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not:
        and Israel abode in Kadesh.
011:018 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land
        of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
        of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side
        of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab,
        for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
011:019 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass,
        we pray you, through your land to my place.
011:020 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border;
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz,
        and fought against Israel.
011:021 Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his
        people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them:
        so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants
        of that country.
011:022 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon
        even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
011:023 So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites
        from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?
011:024 Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?
        So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us,
        them will we possess.
011:025 Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor,
        king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did
        he ever fight against them?
011:026 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer
        and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side
        of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover
        them within that time?
011:027 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong
        to war against me:  Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day
        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
011:028 However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen
        to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
011:029 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed
        over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
011:030 Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
        deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
011:031 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors
        of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
        of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up
        for a burnt offering.
011:032 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight
        against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.
011:033 He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty
        citi
That's the truth!"

Colonel Welsh hesitated, then shrugged and stuck the gun in his pocket.

"It was too much to hope for, anyway," he muttered more to himself.
"Let's get going. You lads get the plane started while I lug these two
outside. A mighty big day for America so far. Now, if only you two
can--"

The senior officer sighed and let the rest hang in the air. Then he
bent over, caught each man by the heels, and hauled them out into the
brilliant sunshine like a couple of logs. They yelped and babbled with
pain, but the Colonel had deaf ears. Twenty minutes later the two fifth
column prisoners were stowed aboard the Stinson, and the plane's props
were ticking over. Dave and Freddy had refilled the tanks from tins of
gas they found in the second shack. The shiny thing that Dave had seen
under the trees from the air proved to be a high speed Waco fitted with
two machine guns. For a moment they debated whether or not one of them
should fly it back. On second thought, though, they decided it was best
for them all to stick together in the same ship, and let somebody minutes later the two fifth

pick up the Waco later.

"Okay, all aboard!" Dave finally announced, and gave Freddy a friendly
slap on the back. "Go on and fly her, pal. You've sure earned the
honor. And, heck, my nerves can stand anything, now."

"I knew the compliment would have a nasty ending to it!" the English
youth growled, and shook his head. "No, fly her yourself. I've done my
share of work today. Besides, you know this neck of the world. I don't."

"Well, somebody fly it!" Colonel Welsh shouted from inside the cabin.
"We've still got to get to San Diego, you know. Come on, snap it up,
you two!"

"Okay!" Dave growled, and shouldered Freddy Farmer out of the way. "If
I must I must. Who was your slave last year, Mister?"

"Same chap," Freddy said with a chuckle. "And his good manners haven't
improved a bit. San Diego, my good man! And in a bit of a hurry,
please!"

"Very good, sir!" Dave grunted and made a face. "And you can guess what
I'm _thinking_!"




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

_Death Strikes Often_


A huge ball of gold and red hung balanced on the western lip of
the world. Shafts of shimmering fire radiated out from it in all
directions. They filled the sky with a mixture of shades that ranged
from a delicate pink to blood red. They bathed the earth with the same
hues, and seemed actually to creep into every nook and corner. The line
of planes on the San Diego field looked like the work of an imaginative
artist on nature's canvas rather than the real thing. It was a sight
to hold the eye and catch the breath--but Dave Dawson stared at it and
wasn't even conscious of what he was looking at.

He and Freddy Farmer were in the field Commandant's office, waiting for
Colonel Welsh to show up. But that was just the trouble. They had been
waiting for three solid hours for the Intelligence chief to return from
wherever he had gone. Three hours before Dave had put the Stinson down
on the field. At Colonel Welsh's order he had taxied it straight into
an empty hangar and cut the engines. The Colonel had jumped out and
disappeared for five minutes. He had returned with the field's C.O. and
a half dozen mechanics, and a closed car. The two fifth columnists had
been dumped in the car, and driven away. After hasty introductions to
the field Commandant, the Colonel had led them over to the field office
and told them to wait for him to return.

That had been three hours ago, and they were still waiting.

"Stop worrying, and come finish this food they sent over," Freddy
Farmer presently broke the silence. "Good grief, Dave, it doesn't do
any good to wear out the floor like that. Come on and have some more to
eat. Eggs, mind you! I haven't had an egg since I don't know when."

"You and your stomach!" Dave grated, and half turned from the window.
"You should choke on them. Look out there. The Indian! If they're
not getting ready to weigh anchor, then I'm nuts! Where is that guy,
anyway? He should have told us that--Jeepers!"

Freddy stopped some egg halfway to his mouth and looked up.

"What?" he demanded. "What's the matter?"

"The Colonel," Dave said with an effort. "I mean--I sure hope nothing's
happened to him."

Freddy Farmer considered that for a moment, then shrugged and carried
the egg the rest of the way to his mouth.

"Not likely, I think," he finally said. "Probably got those two chaps
to talk. Maybe it's made a difference. I mean, maybe he's decided to
call off this Indian show. Wouldn't mind that at all. They might post
us here at this field. Wonderful food, you know."

"It certainly _sounds_ good!" Dave cracked. Then, glancing out the
window again: "I sure hope they don't call off the show. That Indian
looks pretty nice to me out there. I could go for a trip on her.
Besides, I'm itching to take a whack or six at those dirty Japs. I
think I hate them worse than the Nazis, Freddy."

"Me, too, if that's possible," the English youth replied. "But I was
really talking just to hear myself. I'd like a trip on the Indian,
too. She's the latest of her class, and should have everything. Also,
according to the Colonel, she's steaming out to do battle. I could
fancy a little combat work. Doesn't pay to get rusty. My, but that meal
was good!"

"What a man!" Dave sighed at the window. "On an empty stomach he's not
worth a dime. Fill him up and he's a one man air force, and raring to
go. He's--"

Dave stopped short and wheeled quickly as the door opened and Colonel
Welsh came inside. The man's face was grim, and there was the look of
angry defeat in his eyes.

"Sorry I took so long, fellows," he said, and dropped into a chair. "I
had to check up on a few things, and get a few things underway. Took
longer than I figured."

"Those rats told the truth, eh?" Dave grunted. "They still don't know a
thing about the Indian?"

The Colonel shook his head and clenched his two fists in a helpless
gesture.

"Not a thing!" he got out savagely. "But they seem to be the only two
who don't."

"What do you mean by that, sir?" Freddy asked.

"Well, I don't mean it exactly the way I put it," the Colonel said with
a shake of his head. "But it seems the entire Axis organization in this
country has found out that their agent aboard the Indian has stolen the
battle plans of the carrier, and that I was to put four men aboard to
try and trap him and nail him to the mast. Those two agents of mine,
and you two."

"Your two agents got aboard last night, sir?" Dave prompted as the
senior officer stopped talking abruptly.

"No," was the bitter reply. "They were shot and killed as they stepped
into the waiting tender at the Navy pier."

"Shot?" Dave gasped. "Gee! That was tough. I hope the killers were
caught."

"They were, and captured dead," the Colonel said bluntly. "Two
waterfront rats. Looked that, anyway. One a Jap, obviously. The other
looked like a German. No papers or anything on him, though. So he could
have been almost any nationality. But the important thing is, that I
found the leak in my own organization. I put through a call to Captain
Lamb and he told me. He'd sent word to our San Diego office last night
for me to contact him at once. I called him, and--"

"The bloke reading the book in your outer office!" Freddy Farmer cried.

"The man who ran the elevator!" Dave exclaimed.

Colonel Welsh caught his breath and shot a hard look at Dawson.

"How did you know?" he demanded.

"I didn't," Dave replied. "But I had a hunch it might be one of those
two. It had to be somebody close to you, and--well, Freddy had already
picked the one in the outer office."

"It was the one who brought you up in the elevator," Colonel Welsh
said with an effort. "It's--it's things like this that almost make me
lose faith. That man had been in the bureau for six years. For four
years before that he was connected with Secret Service. His record was
spotless. And the amazing part is that he had performed some valuable
services for me. But that goes to show you the finesse of the Gestapo
and Nazi agent technique. Shows you how long ago Hitler laid plans for
America. I would have staked my life on Babson, but--"

The officer paused and gestured despairingly.

"But of course I would have lost my life!" he suddenly bit off. "But
for an accident I'd never have found out, perhaps. And who knows what
else that would have cost us? He was taking Lamb down late last night.
As he opened the doors a slip of paper fell out of his pocket. Lamb
caught it in mid-air, and was starting to hand it back when he saw
what was on the paper. It was a bit of code, obviously jotted down in
a hurry. But it was a code that only Lamb and I knew, not another
soul in the world. For years he and I have been working on a code that
can't possibly be broken down by any of the experts. We thought we had
found it. Kept our papers on it in a safe. Only Lamb and I knew the
combination--we thought."

"What happened, sir?" Freddy asked eagerly as Colonel Welsh let his
voice trail off into silence. "Did Captain Lamb make the dirty beggar
confess?"

"What happened, sir?" Freddy asked eagerly as Colonel Welsh let his
voice trail off into silence. "Did Captain Lamb make the dirty beggar
confess?"
 could go for a trip on her.
Besides, I'm itching to take a whack or six at those dirty Japs. I
think I hate them worse than the Nazis, Freddy."

"Me, too, if that's possible," the English youth replied. "But I was
really talking just to hear myself. I'd like a trip on the Indian,
too. She's the latest of her class, and should have everything. Also,
according to the Colonel, she's steaming out to do battle. I could
fancy a little combat work. Doesn't pay to get rusty. My, but that meal
was good!"

"What a man!" Dave sighed at the window. "On an empty stomach he's not
worth a dime. Fill him up and he's a one man air force, and raring to
go. He's--"

Dave stopped short and wheeled quickly as the door opened and Colonel
Welsh came inside. The man's face was grim, and there was the look of
angry defeat in his eyes.

"Sorry I took so long, fellows," he said, and dropped into a chair. "I
had to check up on a few things, and get a few things underway. Took
longer than I figured."

"Those rats told the truth, eh?" Dave grunted. "They still don't know a
thing about the Indian?"

The Colonel shook his head and clenched his two fists in a helpless
gesture.

"Not a thing!" he got out savagely. "But they seem to be the only two
who don't."

"What do you mean by that, sir?" Freddy asked.

"Well, I don't mean it exactly the way I put it," the Colonel said with
a shake of his head. "But it seems the entire Axis organization in this
country has found out that their agent aboard the Indian has stolen the
battle plans of the carrier, and that I was to put four men aboard to
try and trap him and nail him to the mast. Those two agents of mine,
and you two."

"Your two agents got aboard last night, sir?" Dave prompted as the
senior officer stopped talking abruptly.

"No," was the bitter reply. "They were shot and killed as they stepped
into the waiting tender at the Navy pier."

"Shot?" Dave gasped. "Gee! That was tough. I hope the killers were
caught."

"They were, and captured dead," the Colonel said bluntly. "Two
waterfront rats. Looked that, anyway. One a Jap, obviously. The other
looked like a German. No papers or anything on him, though. So he could
have been almost any nationality. But the important thing is, that I
found the leak in my own organization. I put through a call to Captain
Lamb and he told me. He'd sent word to our San Diego office last night
for me to contact him at once. I called him, and--"

"The bloke reading the book in your outer office!" Freddy Farmer cried.

"The man who ran the elevator!" Dave exclaimed.

Colonel Welsh caught his breath and shot a hard look at Dawson.

"How did you know?" he demanded.

"I didn't," Dave replied. "But I had a hunch it might be one of those
two. It had to be somebody close to you, and--well, Freddy had already
picked the one in the outer office."

"It was the one who brought you up in the elevator," Colonel Welsh
said with an effort. "It's--it's things like this that almost make me
lose faith. That man had been in the bureau for six years. For four
years before that he was connected with Secret Service. His record was
spotless. And the amazing part is that he had performed some valuable
services for me. But that goes to show you the finesse of the Gestapo
and Nazi agent technique. Shows you how long ago Hitler laid plans for
America. I would have staked my life on Babson, but--"

The officer paused and gestured despairingly.

"But of course I would have lost my life!" he suddenly bit off. "But
for an accident I'd never have found out, perhaps. And who knows what
else that would have cost us? He was taking Lamb down late last night.
As he opened the doors a slip of paper fell out of his pocket. Lamb
caught it in mid-air, and was starting to hand it back when he saw
what was on the paper. It was a bit of code, obviously jotted down in
a hurry. But it was a code that only Lamb and I knew, not another
soul in the world. For years he and I have been working on a code that
can't possibly be broken down by any of the experts. We thought we had

"What happened, sir?" Freddy asked eagerly as Colonel Welsh let his
voice trail off into silence. "Did Captain Lamb make the dirty beggar
confess?"
The chief of U. S. Intelligence shook his head.

"He didn't have time," he said. "Babson realized instantly that he'd
never in the world be able to explain his possession of that bit of
copied code. His only hope was quick action, and flight. He went for
his gun. Lamb didn't give me the details of the fight. He won, and
Babson is dead. Then Lamb got busy. He began with the little office
Babson used on the ground floor. He--It seems incredible! I thought
that Lamb was crazy, or blind drunk, and making it up. But he wasn't,
of course. Babson had actually installed a dictograph in our working
room. The other end was in his office. The wire led out behind the
files, under the corridor boards and down the elevator shaft, and
under the lobby floor to his office. He could hear every word we said
up there. How he learned that safe combination, we'll probably never
find out. In his Washington hotel room Lamb found enough stuff to hang
the man a dozen times over. Too bad we won't be able to do it. I feel
like going out and shooting myself. I'm the one responsible, of course.
One of my own trusted men! That's the worst of it!"

The Colonel gave a bewildered shake of his head, and groaned heavily.

"That's war, I guess," Dave murmured sympathetically. "And the same
thing has happened in other countries, sir. It isn't going to help any
to take it too hard, you know. Anyway, the rat is dead, and the leak is
plugged up. That's something, at least."

"But mighty little!" the Colonel said bitterly. Then, stabbing a
finger at the window facing the harbor, he grated, "There's the Indian
out there. In an hour she weighs anchor. Aboard her is the most
dangerous rat of all. He possesses information that could well mean the
difference between victory and defeat if it falls into Jap hands. We
can't hold the Indian. She's got to sail. Without her the whole battle
plan is mixed up. Yet if she sails and we don't catch that scoundrel,
who knows what will happen? I had hoped, but--well, now that's all
shot, too."

"What's all shot, sir?" Dave asked quickly.

"The job I had planned for you and Farmer aboard the Indian," the
Colonel replied. "It was a wild hope even at best, but now it isn't
even that. The rats know why I wanted you two aboard her. True, maybe
the man you're after doesn't know. I've a feeling, though, he does.
The way things have gone, I feel certain they got word to him somehow.
If they did, he'd know exactly why you were there the moment you came
over the side. And--well, to put it bluntly, he's killed twice already.
Twice more wouldn't bother him if he suspected you were getting close
to him. He'd--"

"We can watch our step," Dave cut in grimly.

"Too great a risk," the Colonel replied. "You see, it wouldn't be a
matter of your actually getting close, but the matter of his _thinking_
that you _were_ close. He'd know who you were, and why you were aboard.
The advantage would be all his. It would be unfair to ask any man to
tackle a job like that."

"I don't fancy so, sir," Freddy Farmer spoke up quietly. "After all,
rats usually do have all the advantage until you get them cornered.
Supposing he does know why we're there? Let him, I say. It's a job to
be done, and somebody's got to tackle it, sir. Good grief! If somebody
doesn't go after the blighter, it's like letting the Indian sail with a
lighted fuse leading to her powder magazine."

"I check on that, too, sir!" Dave cried eagerly. "Freddy and I aren't
trying to toot our horns, Colonel. Maybe we'll fall flat on our faces.
But maybe we won't. However, at least we'll be aboard in case something
does turn up that gives us a clue."

"Yes, of course," the Colonel grunted, and frowned. "That's quite true.
But you could be throwing your lives away--and uselessly, too. You two
helped accomplish something almost as big today, perhaps even bigger. I
can't say yet. But capturing those two American born rats was a mighty
big step toward smashing a lot of the Fifth Column business in this
country. I mean that, too. That place was one of their arsenals where
they've cached guns to be used when Berlin sends the order to strike
at the United States from within. It's one of several arsenals located
about the country. Those papers contained names and addresses of key
men in their organization. And right now some of my agents, and F.B.I.
agents, are waiting in that shack for the so-called big boss. His
capture alone will be something mighty big. Yes, you two played a major
part today in nipping something big in the bud. So it isn't fair to ask
you to--"

"Okay, okay!" Dave suddenly snapped. "If you don't think we rate a
crack at it, then have the Indian sail without us. I'm willing to take
the chance. So's Freddy. But if you think we'd mess up things, then
skip it. Let it slide."

The Colonel blinked and gave Dave a startled look. It wasn't every datian's hand, and killed
        him with his own spear.
023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
        among the three mighty men.
023:023 He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
        to the [first] three.  David set him over his guard.
023:024 Asahel the brother of J
001:039 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
        and anointed Solomon.  They blew the trumpet; and all
        the people said, [Long] live king Solomon.
001:040 All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
        and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with
        the sound of them.
001:041 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
        had made an end of eating.  When Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being
        in an uproar?
001:042 While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came:  and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are
        a worthy man, and bring good news.
001:043 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
        has made Solomon king:
002:046 It happened after three days they found him in the temple,
        sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them,
        and asking them questions.
002:047 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
002:048 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother
        said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way?prophet.
013:021 Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son
        of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty yearf heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond treshall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed,ghters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
        or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken
        at the cistern,
012:007 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
        returns to God who gave it.
012:008 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
012:009 Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge.  Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set
        in order many proverbs.

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

No, mortals blended by terror! The friend of nature is not your enemy;
its interpreter is not the minister of falsehood; the destroyer of your
vain phantoms is not the devastator of those truths necessary to your
happiness; the disciple of reason is not an irrational being, who either
seeks to poison you, or to infect you with a dangerous delirium. If
he is desirous to wrest the thunder from those terrible theories that
affright ye, it is that ye way discontinue your march, in the midst
of storms, over roads that ye can only distinguish by the sudden, but
evanescent glimmerings of the electric fluid. If he breaks those idols,
which fear has served with myrrh and frankencense--which superstition
has surrounded by gloomy despondency--which fanaticism has imbrued with
blood; it is to substitute in their place those consoling truths that
are calculated to heal the desperate wounds ye have received; that are
suitable to inspire you with courage, sturdily to oppose yourselves
to such dangerous errors; that have power to enable you to resist such
formidable enemies. If he throws down the temples, overturns the altars,
so frequently bathed with the bitter tears of the unfortunate, blackened
by the most cruel sacrifices, smoked with servile incense, it is that he
may erect a fane sacred to peace; a hall dedicated to reason; a durable
monument to virtue, in which ye may at all times find an asylum against
your own phrenzy; a refuge from your own ungovernable passions; a
sanctuary against those powerful dogmatists, by whom ye are oppressed.
If he attacks the haughty pretensions of deified tyrants, who crush ye
with an iron sceptre, it is that ye may enjoy the rights of your nature;
it is to the end that ye may be substantively freemen, in mind as well
as in body; that ye may not be slaves, eternally chained to the oar of
misery; it is that ye may at length be governed by men who are citizens,
who may cherish their own semblances, who way protect mortals like
themselves, who may actually consult the interests of those from
whom they hold their power. If he battles with imposture, it is to
re-establish truth in those rights which have been so long usurped by
fiction. If he undermines the base of that unsteady, fanatical morality,
which has hitherto done nothing more than perplex your minds, without
correcting your hearts; it is to give to ethics an immovable basis, a
solid foundation, secured upon your own nature; upon the reciprocity of
those wants which are continually regenerating in sensible beings: dare,
then, to listen to his voice; you will find it much more intelligible
than those ambiguous oracles, which are announced to you as the
offspring of capricious theories; as imperious decrees that are
unceasingly at variance with themselves. Listen then to nature, she
never contradicts her own eternal laws.

"O thou!" cries this nature to man, "who, following the impulse I
have given you, during your whole existence, incessantly tend towards
happiness, do not strive to resist my sovereign law. Labour to your own
felicity; partake without fear of the banquet which is spread before
you, with the most hearty welcome; you will find the means legibly
written on your own heart. Vainly dost thou, O superstitious being! seek
after thine happiness beyond the limits of the universe, in which my
hand hath placed thee: vainly shalt thou search it in those inexorable
theories, which thine imagination, ever prone to wander, would establish
upon my eternal throne: vainly dost thou expect it in those fanciful
regions, to which thine own delirium hath given a locality and a shame:
vainly dost thou reckon upon capricious systems, with whose advantages
thou art in such ecstasies; whilst they only fill thine abode with
calamity--thine heart with dread--thy mind with illusions--thy bosom
with groans. Know that when thou neglectest my counsels, the gods will
refuse their aid. Dare, then, to affranchise thyself from the trammels
of superstition, my self-conceited, pragmatic rival, who mistakes
my rights; renounce those empty theories, which are usurpers of my
privileges; return under the dominion of my laws, which, however severe,
are mild in comparison with those of bigotry. It is in my empire
alone that true liberty reigns. Tyranny is unknown to its soil; equity
unceasingly watches over the rights of all my subjects, maintains
them in the possession of their just claims; benevolence, grafted upon
humanity, connects them by amicable bonds; truth enlightens them; never
can imposture blind them with his obscuring mists. Return, then,
my child, to thy fostering mother's arms! Deserter, trace back thy
wandering steps to nature! She will console thee for thine evils; she
will drive from thine heart those appalling fears which overwhelm thee;
those inquietudes that distract thee; those transports which agitate
thee; those hatreds that separate thee from thy fellow man, whom thou
shouldst love as thyself. Return to nature, to humanity, to thyself!
Strew flowers over the road of life: cease to contemplate the future;
live to thine own happiness; exist for thy fellow creatures; retire into
thyself, examine thine own heart, then consider the sensitive beings by
whom thou art surrounded: leave to their inventors those systems which
can effect nothing towards thy felicity. Enjoy thyself, and cause others
also to enjoy, those comforts which I have placed with a liberal hand,
for all the children of the earth; who all equally emanate from my
bosom: assist them to support the sorrows to which necessity has
submitted them in common with thyself. Know, that I approve thy
pleasures, when without injuring thyself, they are not fatal to thy
brethren, whom I have rendered indispensably necessary to thine own
individual happiness. These pleasures are freely permitted thee, if thou
indulgest them with moderation; with that discretion which I myself have
fixed. Be happy, then, O man! Nature invites thee to participate in it;
but always remember, thou canst not be so alone; because I invite all
mortals to happiness as well as thyself; thou will find it is only in
securing their felicity that thou canst consolidate thine own. Such is
the decree of thy destiny: if thou shalt attempt to withdraw thyself
from its operation, recollect that hatred will pursue thee; vengeance
overtake thy steps; and remorse be ever ready at hand to punish the
infractions of its irrevocable mandates.

"Follow then, O man! in whatever station thou findest thyself, the
routine I have described for thee, to obtain that happiness to which
thou hast an indispensable right to challenge pretension. Let the
sensations of humanity interest thee for the condition of other men, who
are thy fellow creatures; let thine heart have commisseration for their
misfortunes: let thy generous hand spontaneously stretch forth to lend
succour to the unhappy mortal who is overwhelmed by his destiny; always
bearing in thy recollection, that it may fall heavy upon thyself, as
it now does upon him. Acknowledge, then, without guile, that every
unfortunate has an inalienable right to thy kindness. Above all, wipe
from the eyes of oppressed innocence the trickling crystals of agonized
feeling; let the tears of virtue in distress, fall upon thy sympathizing
bosom; let the genial glow of sincere friendship animate thine honest
heart; let the fond attachment of a mate, cherished by thy warmest
affection, make thee forget the sorrows of life: be faithful to her
love, responsible to her tenderness, that she may reward thee by
a reciprocity of feeling; that under the eyes of parents united in
virtuous esteem, thy offspring may learn to set a proper value on
practical virtue; that after having occupied thy riper years, they may
comfort thy declining age, gild with content thy setting sun, cheer the
evening of thine existence, by a dutiful return of that care which thou
shalt have bestowed on their imbecile infancy.

"Be just, because equity is the support of human society! Be good,
because goodness connects all hearts in adamantine bonds! Be indulgent,
because feeble thyself, thou livest with beings who partake of thy
weakness! Be gentle, because mildness attracts attention! Be thankful,
because gratitude feeds benevolence, nourishes generosity! Be modest,
because haughtiness is disgusting to beings at all times well with
themselves. Forgive injuries, because revenge perpetuates hatred! Do
good to him who injureth thee, in order to shew thyself more noble than
he is; to make a friend of him, who was once thine enemy! Be reserved
in thy demeanor, temperate in thine enjoyment, chaste in thy pleasures,
because voluptuousness begets weariness, intemperance engenders disease;
forward manners are revolting: excess at all times relaxes the springs
of thy machine, will ultimately destroy thy being, and render thee
hateful to thyself, contemptible to others.

"Be a faithful citizen; because the community is necessary to thine own
security; to the enjoyment of thine own existence; to the furtherance
of thine own happiness. Be loyal, but be brave; submit to legitimate
authority; because it is requisite to the maintenance of that society
which is necessary to thyself. Be obedient to the laws; because they
_are_, or _ought to be_, the expression of the public will, to which
thine own particular will ought ever to be subordinate. Defend thy
country with zeal; because it is that which renders thee happy, which
contains thy property, as well as those beings dearest to thine heart:
do not permit this common parent of thyself, as well as of thy fellow
citizens, to fall under the shackles of tyranny; because from thence
it will be no more than thy common prison. If thy country, deaf to the
equity of thy claims, refuses thee happiness--if, submitted to an unjust
power, it suffers thee to be oppressed, withdraw thyself from its bosom
in silence, but never disturb its peace.

"In short, be a man; be a sensible, rational being; be a faithful
husband; a tender father; an equitable master; a zealous citizen; labour
to serve thy country by thy prowess; by thy talents; by thine industry;
above all, by thy virtues. Participate with thine associates those gifts
which nature has bestowed upon thee; diffuse happiness, among thy fellow
mortals; inspire thy fellow citizens with content; spread joy over all
those who approach thee, that the sphere of thine actions, enlivened by
thy kindness, illumined by thy benevolence, may re-act upon thyself; be
assured that the man who makes others happy cannot himself be miserable.
In thus conducting thyself, whatever may be the injustice of others,
whatever may be the blindness of those beings with whom it is thy
destiny to live, thou wilt never be totally bereft of the recompense
which is thy due; no power on earth be able to ravish from thee that
never failing source of the purest felicity, inward content; at each
moment thou wilt fall back with pleasure upon thyself; thou wilt neither
feel the rankling of shame, the terror of internal alarm, nor find
thy heart corroded by remorse. Thou wilt esteem thyself; thou wilt be
cherished by the virtuous, applauded and loved by all good men, whose
suffrages are much more valuable than those of the bewildered
multitude. Nevertheless, if externals occupy thy contemplation, smiling
countenances will greet thy presence; happy faces will express the
interest they have in thy welfare; jocund beings will make thee
participate in their placid feelings. A life so spent, will each moment
be marked by the serenity of thine own soul, by the affection of the
beings who environ thee; will be made cheerful by the friendship of thy
fellows; will enable thee to rise a contented, satisfied guest from the
general feast; conduct thee gently down the declivity of life, lead thee
peaceably to the period of thy days; for die thou must: but already
thou wilt survive thyself in thought; thou wilt always live in the
remembrance of thy friends; in the grateful recollection of those beings
whose comforts have been augmented by thy friendly attentions; thy
virtues will, beforehand have erected to thy fame an imperishable
monument: if heaven occupies itself with thee, it will feel satisfied
with thy conduct, when it shall thus have contented the earth.

"Beware, then, how thou complainest of thy condition; be just, be kind,
be virtuous, and thou canst never be wholly destitute of felicity. Take
heed how thou enviest the transient pleasure of seductive crime; the
deceitful power of victorious tyranny; the specious tranquillity of
interested imposture; the plausible manners of venal justice; the shewy,
ostentatious parade of hardened opulence. Never be tempted to increase
the number of sycophants to an ambitious despot; to swell the catalogue
of slaves to an unjust tyrant; never suffer thyself to be allured to
infamy, to the practice of extortion, to the commission of outrage, by
the fatal privilege of oppressing thy fellows; always recollect it will
be at the expence of the most bitter remorse thou wilt acquire this
baneful advantage. Never be the mercenary accomplice of the spoilers of
thy country; they are obliged to blush secretly whenever they meet the
public eye.

"For, do not deceive thyself, it is I who punish, with an unerring hand,
all the crimes of the earth; the wicked may escape the laws of man, but
they never escape mine. It is I who have formed the hearts, as well
an the bodies of mortals; it is I who have fixed the laws which govern
them. If thou deliverest thyself up to voluptuous enjoyment, the
companions of thy debaucheries may applaud thee; but I shall punish thee
with the most cruel infirmities; these will terminate a life of shame
with deserved contempt. If thou givest, thyself up to intemperate
indulgences, human laws may not correct thee, but I shall castigate thee
severely by abridging thy days. If thou art vicious, thy fatal habits
will recoil on thine own head. Princes, those terrestrial divinities,
whose power places them above the laws of mankind, are nevertheless
obliged to tremble under the silent operation of my decrees. It is I who
chastise them; it is I who fill their breasts with suspicion; it is
I who inspire them with terror; it is I who make them writhe under
inquietude; it is I who make them shudder with horror, at the very name
of august truth; it is I who, amidst the crowd of nobles who surround
them, make them feel the inward workings of shame; the keen anguish of
guilt; the poisoned arrows of regret; the cruel stings of remorse; it is
I who, when they abuse my bounty, diffuse weariness over their benumbed
souls; it is I who follow uncreated, eternal justice; it is I who,
without distinction of persons, know how to make the balance even; to
adjust the chastisement to the fault; to make the misery bear its due
proportion to the depravity; to inflict punishment commensurate with the
crime. The laws of man are just, only when they are in conformity with
mine; his judgements are rational, only when I have dictated them: my
laws alone are immutable, universal, irrefragable; formed to regulate
the condition of the human race, in all ages, in all places, under all
circumstances.

"If thou doubtest mine authority, if thou questionest the irresistible
power I possess over mortals, contemplate the vengeance I wreak on all
those who resist my decrees. Dive into the recesses of the hearts of
those various criminals, whose countenances, assuming a forced smile,
cover souls torn with anguish. Dost thou not behold ambition tormented
day and night, with an ardour which nothing can extinguish? Dost not
thou see the mighty conquerer become the lord of devastated solitudes;
his victorious career, marked by a blasted cultivation, reign
sorrowfully over smoking ruins; govern unhappy wretches who curse him in
their hearts; while his soul, gnawed by remorse, sickens at the gloomy
aspect of his own triumphs? Dost thou believe that the tyrant, encircled
with his flatterers, who stun him with their praise, is unconscious of
the hatred which his oppression excites; of the contempt which his vices
draw upon him; of the sneers which his inutility call forth; of the
scorn which his debaucheries entail upon his name? Dost thou think that
the haughty courtier does not inwardly blush at the galling insults he
brooks; despise, from the bottom of his soul, those meannesses by
which he is compelled to purchase favours; feel at his heart's core the
wretched dependence in which his cupidity places him.

"Contemplate the indolent child of wealth, behold him a prey to the
lassitude of unmeasured enjoyment, corroded by the satiety which always
follows his exhausted pleasures. View the miser with an emaciated
countenance, the consequence of his own penurious disposition, whose
callous heart is inaccessible to the calls of misery, groaning over the
accumulating load of useless treasure, which at the expense of himself,
he has laboured to amass. Behold the gay voluptuary, the smiling
debaucheé, secretly lament the health they have so inconsiderately
damaged so prodigally thrown away: see disdain, joined to hatred, reign
between those adulterous married couples, who have reciprocally violated
the sacred vows they mutually pledged at the altar of Hymen; whose
appetencies have rendered them the scorn of the world; the jest of their
acquaintance; polluted tributaries to the surgeon. See the liar
deprived of all confidence; the knave stript of all trust; the hypocrite
fearfully avoiding the penetrating looks of his inquisitive neighbour;
the impostor trembling at the very name of formidable truth. Bring under
your review the heart of the envious, uselessly dishonored; that withers
at the sight of his neighbour's prosperity. Cast your eyes on the frozen
soul of the ungrateful wretch, whom no kindness can warm, no benevolence
thaw, no beneficence convert into a genial fluid. Survey the iron
feelings of that monster whom the sighs of the unfortunate cannot
mollify. Behold the revengeful being nourished with venemous gall, whose
very thoughts are serpents; who in his rage consumes himself. Envy, if
thou canst, the waking slumbers of the homicide; the startings of the
iniquitous judge; the restlessness of the oppressor of innocence; the
fearful visions of the extortioner; whose couches are infested with the
torches of the furies. Thou tremblest without doubt at the sight of
that distraction which, amidst their splendid luxuries, agitates those
farmers of the revenue, who fatten upon public calamnity--who devour the
substance of the orphan--who consume the means of the widow--who grind
the hard earnings of the poor: thou shudderest at witnessing the remorse
which rends the souls of those reverend criminals, whom the uninformed
believe to be happy, whilst the contempt which they have for themselves,
the unerring shafts of secret upbraidings, are incessantly revenging
an outraged nation. Thou seest, that content is for ever banished the
heart; quiet for ever driven from the habitations of those miserable
wretches on whose minds I have indelibly engraved the scorn, the infamy,
the chastisement which they deserve. But, no! thine eyes cannot sustain
the tragic spectacle of my vengeance. Humanity obliges thee to partake
of their merited sufferings; thou art moved to pity for these unhappy
people, to whom consecrated errors renders vice necessary; whose fatal
habits make them familiar with crime. Yes; thou shunnest them without
hating them; thou wouldst succour them, if their contumacious perversity
had left thee the means. When thou comparest thine own condition, when
thou examinest thine own soul, thou wilt have just cause to felicitate
thyself, if thou shalt find that peace has taken up her abode with thee;
that contentment dwells at the bottom of thine own heart. In short, thou
seest accomplished upon them, as well as, upon thyself, the unalterable
decrees of destiny, which imperiously demand, that crime shall punish
itself, that virtue never shall be destitute Of remuneration."

Such is the sum of those truths which are contained in the _Code of
Nature_; such are the doctrines, which its disciples can announce. They
are unquestionably preferable to that supernatural superstition which
never does any thing but mischief to the human species. Such is the
worship that is taught by that sacred reason, which is the object of
contempt with the theologian; which meets the insult of the fanatic;
who only estimates that which man can neither conceive nor practise; who
make his morality consist in fictitious duties; his virtue in actions
generally useless, frequently pernicious to the welfare of society; who
for want of being acquainted with nature, which is before their eyes,
believe themselves obliged to seek in ideal worlds imaginary motives, of
which every thing proves the inefficacy. The motive which the morality
of nature employs, is the self-evident interest of each individual,
of each community, of the whole human species, in all times, in every
country, under all circumstances. Its worship is the sacrifice of vice,
the practise of real virtues; its object is the conservation of the
human race, the happiness of the individual, the peace of mankind;
its recompences are affection, esteem, and glory; or in their default,
contentment of mind, with merited self-esteem, of which no power will
ever be able to deprive virtuous mortals; its punishments, are hatred,
contempt, and indignation; which society always reserves for those
who outrage its interests; from which even the most powerful can never
effectually shield themselves.

Those nations who shall be disposed to practise a morality so wise, who
shall inculcate it in infancy, whose laws shall unceasingly confirm it,
will neither have occasion for superstition, nor for chimeras. Those
who shall obstinately prefer figments to their dearest interests, will
certainly march forward to ruin. If they maintain themselves for a
season, it is because the power of nature sometimes drives them back to
reason, in despite of those prejudices which appear to lead them on to
certain destruction. Superstition, leagued with tyranny, for the waste
of the human species, are themselves frequently obliged to implore
the assistance of a reason which they contemn; of a nature which they
disdain; which they debase; which they endeavour to crush under the
ponderous bulk of artificial theories. Superstition, in all times so
fatal to mortals, when attacked by reason, assumes the sacred mantle of
public utility; rests its importance on false grounds, founds its
rights upon the indissoluble alliance which it pretends subsists between
morality and itself; notwithstanding it never ceases for a single
instant to wage against it the most cruel hostility. It is,
unquestionably, by this artifice, that it has seduced so many sages.
In the honesty of their hearts, they believe it useful to politics;
necessary to restrain the ungovernable fury of the passions; thus
hypocritical superstition, in order to mask to superficial observers,
its own hideous character, like the ass with the lion's skin, always
knows how to cover itself with the sacred armour of utility; to buckle
on the invulnerable shield of virtue; it has therefore, been believed
imperative to respect it, notwithstanding it felt awkward under these
incumbrances; it consequently has become a duty to favor imposture,
because it has artfully entrenched itself behind the altars of truth;
its ears, however, discover its worthlessness; its natural cowardice
betrays itself; it is from this intrenchment we ought to drive it; it
should be dragged forth to public view; stripped of its surreptitious
panoply; exposed in its native deformity; in order that the human race
may become acquainted with its dissimulation; that mankind may have a
knowledge of its crimes; that the universe may behold its sacrilegious
hands, armed with homicidal poniards, stained with the blood of nations,
whom it either intoxicates with its fury, or immolates without pity to
the violence of its passions.

The MORALITY OF NATURE is the only creed which her interpreter offers to
his fellow citizens; to nations; to the human species; to future races,
weaned from those prejudices which have so frequently disturbed the
felicity of their ancestors. The friend of mankind cannot be the friend
of delusion, which at all times has been a real scourge to the earth.
The APOSTLE OF NATURE will not be the instrument of deceitful chimeras,
by which this world is made only an abode of illusions; the adorer of
truth will not compromise with falsehood; he will make no covenant with
error; conscious it must always be fatal to mortals. He knows that the
happiness of the human race imperiously exacts that the dark unsteady
edifice of superstition should be razed to its foundations; in order
to elevate on its ruins a temple suitable to peace--a fane sacred to
virtue. He feels it is only by extirpating, even to the most slender
fibres, the poisonous tree, that during so many ages has overshadowed
the universe, that the inhabitants of this world will be able to use
their own optics--to bear with steadiness that light which is competent
to illumine their understanding--to guide their wayward steps--to give
the necessary ardency to their souls. If his efforts should be vain; if
he cannot inspire with courage, beings too much accustomed to tremble;
he will, at least, applaud himself for having dared the attempt.
Nevertheless, he will not judge his exertions fruitless, if he has
only been enabled to make a single mortal happy: if his principles have
calmed the conflicting transports of one honest soul; if his reasonings
have cheered up some few virtuous hearts. At least he will have the
advantage of having banished from his own mind the importunate terror
of superstition; of having expelled from his own heart the gall which
exasperates zeal; of having trodden under foot those chimeras with which
the uninformed are tormented. Thus, escaped from the peril of the storm,
he will calmly contemplate from the summit of his rock, those tremendous
hurricanes which superstition excites; he will hold forth a succouring
hand to those who shall be willing to accept it; he will encourage them
with his voice; he will second them with his best exertions, and in the
warmth of his own compassionate heart, he will exclaim:

O NATURE; sovereign of all beings! and ye, her adorable daughters,
VIRTUE, REASON, and TRUTH! remain for ever our revered protectors: it is
to you that belong the praises of the human race; to you appertains the
homage of the earth. Shew, us then, O NATURE! that which man ought
to do, in order to obtain the happiness which thou makest him desire.
VIRTUE! Animate him with thy beneficent fire. REASON! Conduct his
uncertain steps through the paths of life. TRUTH! Let thy torch illumine
his intellect, dissipate the darkness of his road. Unite, O assisting
deities! your powers, in order to submit the hearts of mankind to
your dominion. Banish error from our mind; wickedness from our hearts;
confusion from our footsteps; cause knowledge to extend its salubrious
reign; goodness to occupy our souls; serenity to dwell in our bosoms.
Let imposture, confounded, never again dare to shew its head. Let our
eyes, so long, either dazzled or blindfolded, be at length fixed
upon those objects we ought to seek. Dispel for ever those mists
of ignorance, those hideous phantoms, together with those seducing
chimeras, which only serve to lead us astray. Extricate us from that
dark abyss into which we are plunged by superstition; overthrow the
fatal empire of delusion; crumble the throne of falsehood; wrest from
their polluted hands the power they have usurped. Command men, without
sharing your authority with mortals: break the chains that bind them
down in slavery: tear away the bandeau by which they are hoodwinked;
allay the fury that intoxicates them; break in the hands of sanguinary,
lawless tyrants, that iron sceptre with which they are crushed to
exile; the imaginary regions, from whence fear has imported them, those
theories by which they are afflicted. Inspire the intelligent being with
courage; infuse energy into his system, that, at length, he may feel his
own dignity; that he may dare to love himself; to esteem his own actions
when they are worthy; that a slave only to your eternal laws, he may no
longer fear to enfranchise himself from all other trammels; that blest
with freedom, he may have the wisdom to cherish his fellow creature; and
become happy by learning to perfection his own condition; instruct him
in the great lesson, that the high road to felicity, is prudently to
partake himself, and also to cause others to enjoy, the rich banquet
which thou, O Nature! hast so bountifully set before him. Console thy
children for those sorrows to which their destiny submits them, by
those pleasures which wisdom allows them to partake; teach them to be
contented with their condition; to banish envy from their mind; to yield
silently to necessity. Conduct them without alarm to that period which
all beings must find; _let them learn that time changes all things, that
consequently they are made neither to avoid its scythe nor to fear its
arrival._





[TRANSLATOR'S APPENDIX]

A BRIEF SKETCH

OF THE

LIFE AND WRITINGS

OF

M. DE. MIRABAUD.


At a time when we are on the eve of an important change in our
political affairs, which must evidently lead either to the recovery and
re-establishment of our liberties, or to a military despotism, those who
are connected with the press ought to use every exertion to enlighten
their fellow-citizens, and to assert their right of canvassing, in the
most free and unrestrained manner, every subject connected with the
happiness of man.

The priesthood have ever been convenient tools in the hands of
tyrants, to keep the bulk of the people in a degraded servility. By the
superstitious and slavish doctrines which they infuse into their minds,
they prevent them from thinking for themselves and asserting their own
independence. At a moment when national schools are erecting in every
quarter of the country, not with a sincere desire of enlightening the
rising generation, but with the insidious design of instilling into
their minds the doctrines of "Church and King," in order to bolster up
a little longer the present rotten, tottering, and corrupt system: at
a moment, too, when thousands of fanatic preachers are traversing the
country, with a view to subjugate the human mind to the baleful empire
of visonary enthusiasm and sectarian bigotry to the utter extinction
of every noble, manly, liberal, and pilanthropic principle;--at such a
moment as this, we thought that the "SYSTEM OF NATURE" could not fail
to render essential service to the cause both of civil and religious
liberty. No work, ancient or modern, has surpassed it, in the eloquence
and sublimity of its language, or in the facility with which it treats
the most abtruse and difficult subjects. It is, without exception, the
boldest effort the human mind has yet produced, in the investigation
of morals and theology--in the destruction of priestcraft and
superstition--and in developing the sources of all those passions and
prejudices which have proved so fatal to the tranquillity of the world.

The republic of letters has never produced an author whose pen was so
well calculated to emancipate mankind from all those trammels with which
the nurse, the schoolmaster and the priest have successively locked
up their noblest faculties, before they were capable of reasoning and
judging for themselves. The frightful apprehensions of the gloomy
bigot, and all the appalling terrors of superstition, are here utterly
annihilated, to the complete satisfaction of every unbiassed and
impartial person.--These we considered as necessary observations to
make, previous to any attempt at the biography of the author.

Biography may be reckoned among the most interesting of literary
productions. Its intrinsic value is such, that, though capable of
extraordinary embellishment from the hand of genius, yet no inferiority
of execution can so degrade it, as to deprive it of utility. Whatever
relates even to man in general, considered only as an aggregate of
active and intelligent beings, has a strong claim upon our notice; but
that which relates to our author, as distinguished from the rest of his
species, moving in a more exalted sphere, and towering above them by
the resplendent excellencies of his mind, seems to me to be peculiarly
calculated for our contemplation, and ought to form the highest pleasure
of our lives. There is a principle of curiosity implanted in us, which
leads us, in an especial manner, to investigate our fellow creatures;
the eager inquisitiveness with which the mechanic seeks to know the
history of his fellow-workmen and the ardour with which the philosopher,
the poet, or the historian hunts for details that may familiarize
him with, a Descartes or a Newton, with a Milton, a Hume, or a
Gibbon--spring from the same source. Their object, however, may
perhaps vary; for, in the former, it may be for the sake of detraction,
invidious cavil, or malice; in the latter, it is a sweet homage paid by
the human heart to the memory of departed genius.

It has been repeatedly observed that the life of a scholar affords few
materials for biography. This is only negatively true;--could every
scholar have a Boswell, the remark would vanish; or were every scholar
a Rousseau, a Gibbon, or a Cumberland it would be equally nugatory.
What can present higher objects of contemplation--what can claim
more forcibly our attention--where can we seek for subjects of a more
precious nature, than in the elucidation of the operations of mind,
the acquisition of knowledge, the gradual expansion of genius; its
application, its felicities, its sorrows, its wreaths of fame, its cold,
undeserved neglect? Such scenes, painted by, the artist himself, are a
rich bequest to mankind: even when traced by the hand of friendship
or the pencil of admiration, they possess a permanent interest in our
hearts. I cannot conceive a life more worthy of public notice, more
important, more interesting to human nature, than the life of a literary
man, were it executed according to the ideas I have formed of it: did
it exhibit a faithful delineation of the progress of intellect, from the
cradle upwards; did it portray, in accurate colors, the production of
what we call genius: by what accident it was first awakened; what were
its first tendencies; how directed to a particular object; by what means
it was nourished and unfolded; the gradual progress of its operation
in the production of a work; its hopes and fears; its delights; its
miseries; its inspirations; and all the thousand fleeting joys that so
often invest its path but for a moment, and then fade like the dews
of the morning. Let it contain too a transcript of the many nameless
transports that float round the heart, that dance in the gay circle
before the ardent gazing eye, when the first conception of some future
effort strikes the mind; how it pictures undefined delights of fame and
popular applause; how it anticipates the bright moments of invention,
and dwells with prophetic ecstasy on the felicitous execution of
particular parts, that already start into existence by the magic touch
of a heated imagination. Let it depict the tender feelings of solitude,
the breathings of midnight silence, the scenes of mimic life, of imaged
trial, that often occupy the musing mind; let it be such a work, so
drawn, so coloured, and who shall pronounce it inferior? Who rather
will not confess that it presents a picture of human nature, where every
heart may find some corresponding harmony? When, therefore, it is said,
that the life of a scholar is barren, it is so only because it has never
been properly delineated; because those parts only have been selected
which are common, and fail to distinguish him from the common man;
because we have never penetrated into his closet, or into his heart;
because we have drawn him only as an outward figure, and left unnoticed
that internal structure that would delight, astonish, and improve. And
then, when we compare the life of such a man with the more active one
of a soldier, a statesman, or a lawyer, we pronounce it insipid,
uninteresting. True;--the man of study has not fought for hire--he has
not slaughtered at the command of a master: he would disdain to do
so. Though unaccompanied with the glaring actions of public men, which
confound and dazzle by their publicity, but shrink from the estimation
of moral truth, it would present a far nobler picture; yes, and a more
instructive one:--the calm disciple of reason meditates in silence; he
walks his road with innoxious humility; he is poor, but his mind is his
treasure; he cultivates his reason, and she lifts him to the pinnacle of
truth; he learns to tear away the veil of self-love, folly, pride, and
prejudice, and bares the human heart to his inspection; he corrects and
amends; he repairs the breaches made by passion; the proud man passes
him by, and looks upon him with scorn; but he feels his own worth, that
ennobling consciousness which swells in every vein, and inspires him
with true pride--with manly independence: to such a man I could sooner
bow in reverence, than to the haughtiest, most successful candidate for
the world's ambition. But of such men, for the reason I have already
mentioned, our information is scanty. While of others, who have
commanded a greater share of public notoriety, venal or mistaken
admiration has given more than we wished to know. Among these respected
individuals of human nature, may be placed Mirabaud. Had Mirabaud been
an Englishman, who doubts but that we should have possessed at least
ample details of the usual subjects of biographical notice; while all
that has been collected among his own countrymen, is a scanty memoir in
a common dictionary. That we are doomed to remain ignorant of the life
of such men, speaks a loud disgrace.--I lament it.

JOHN BAPTISTE MIRABAUD, was born at Paris in the year 1674. He
prosecuted his infantile studies under the direction of his parents, and
was afterwards entered a member of the _Congregation of the Priests of
the Oratory_, where he passed several years, and produced some very bold
writings, which were never intended for publication.

He was subsequently appointed tutor to the princesses of the House of
Orleans, and then took the resolution of destroying the greater part of
the manuscripts that he produced while a member of the _Congregation_;
but the treachery of some of his friends, to whom he had confided his
manuscripts, rendered this precaution useless, for some of his works
were published during the time he remained the preceptor to his royal
pupils; among which number may be reckoned his "New Liberties of
Thought," a work but little calculated for gaining him friends in the
purlieus of the Court of Orleans. The "Origin and Antiquity of the
World," in three parts, was also published at this period, and from the
publication of this work, may be dated the resolution of M. de Mirabaud
to quit his office of preceptor, which he relinquished, having become
more independent; he now gave himself up entirely to his philosophical
studies, and produced the "System of Nature," with which he was assisted
by Diderot, D'Alembert, Baron D'Olbac, and others.

The profound metaphysical knowledge displayed throughout the System
of Nature, and the doctrines which are therein advanced, warrants the
conclusion, that it is at once the most decisive, boldest, and most
extraordinary work, that the human understanding ever had the courage to
produce. The study of metaphysics his generally been considered the most
terrific to the indolent mind; but the clear and perspicuous reasoning
of a Mirabaud, who has united the most profound argument, with the most
fascinating eloquence, charm and instruct us at the same time. But it
was not, to be expected that such doctrines as are contained in the
System of Nature, would be advanced without meeting with some opposition
from the superficial and bigoted metaphysicians, who feel an interest
in upholding a system of delusion and superstition. No! certainly not,
Their interest was threatened, and their _craft_ in danger, and the
consequence was, that the _Atheist_ or _Disciple of Nature_, has
been abused with every scurrilous epithet, "full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

Atheism is stigmatized with having "opened a wide door for libertinism,
destroying the social and moral compact; and striking a deadly blow
at religion. It is asserted that the atheist, who by his opinions has
deprived himself of the hope and consolation of a future life, has no
motive for the practise of virtue, or to contribute to the well being of
society. Deprived of a chimera which religion every where presents him,
he wanders through the cheerless gloom of scepticism, regardless of the
consequences of an abandoned life. Without a God, he acknowledges no
benefactor; without divine laws, he knows no rule for the conduct of
life, and submits to no law but his passions. An enemy to all social
order, he spurns at human laws, and breaks through every barrier opposed
to his wickedness." Under such colours is an atheist painted: a short
digression must be suffered to examine this picture, and to disprove the
assertions so sweepingly made.

I admit that atheism strikes a deadly blow at religion; because under
the cloak of religion, mankind have been oppressed in all ages; but that
it encourages libertinism, or destroys the "social and moral compact," I
have yet to learn. In all organized governments, men are restrained from
crime and compelled to submission by laws supposed to be made for the
general benefit. These laws are the effect of the first formation of
society for mutual preservation. Here then is a sufficient motive
for the one as well as the other, to contribute to the well-being of
society. The laws of Nature are the same in effect on the atheist
and the religionist. If man be led captive by his passions, and gives
himself to debauchery and voluptuousness, nature will punish him with
bodily infirmities and a debilitated mind. If he be intemperate, she
will shorten his days and bring him to the grave with the most poignant
remorse. The fatal effects of his vicious propensities will fall upon
his own head. A disturber of social order will live in continual fear
of the vengeance of society, and that very fear is a more dreadful
punishment than the just vengeance which perhaps he escapes. It renders
life burdensome, and makes a man hateful to himself. Can men have
stronger motives for the practise of virtue? The atheist is in full
possession of these motives, and the religionist is most completely
swayed by them, whatever may be his pretensions to others derived
from religion. But we are assured he has other motives; more powerful
incentives, in the promise of future rewards and punishments. This, like
all other chimerical doctrines, cannot be maintained if we look at the
general practise of mankind. Let us trace the effects of this doctrine,
or rather let us examine the actions, conduct, and character of men
professing it, and we shall see how little influence it has over them.
The bulk of society believe they shall answer in a future life for the
deeds done in the present. Nay, I hardly think one in a hundred thousand
will say they doubt it. What then is its effect? With this dreadful
sentence, _"Thou shalt go into everlasting punishment,"_ continually
sounded in their ears, do we not daily see the greatest enormities
committed? Are not the most horrid crimes perpetrated in all parts
of the world? The most vicious propensities and the most extravagant
follies are almost indiscriminately gratified. Is not vice frequently
triumphant, and virtue compelled to seek her own reward in retirement?
The laws of society are broken by the most flagrant injustice, and the
laws of nature outraged by the most shocking depravity. All this evil
exists in nations believing themselves to be accountable beings after
death. Where then are the beneficial effects arising, to mankind from
the promulgation of this doctrine? Men who cannot be restrained from
doing evil by human laws, have no dread of any other. Their whole lives
and conduct confirm this. Others who live in submission to the laws of
society, give themselves up to those vicious habits, (without fear of
divine laws) which the law does not take cognizance of. Men, not wholly
depraved, or not without the pale of society, generally respect the
laws, and fear the bad opinion of others. Hence we observe, when
interest or passion leads them into secret vices, they invariably play
the hypocrite; and although they are aware of the denunciations of their
God, whom they acknowledge is a witness to all their actions, while they
preserve their fair fame they still persevere. In fact, they live as if
they disbelieved in his existence; and yet the greatest criminal, the
most depraved wretch, would shudder at being told there is no God. The
atheist, as a man, is liable to commit the same crimes, and fall into
the same vices as the believer; but because he is an atheist, is he a
worse criminal than the other? In one respect, I conceive he is not so
bad. He only acts in defiance of _human_ laws,--he only offends men; the
other infringes _both divine_ and _human_;--he defies both God and man.
Both are injurious to society and themselves, and both are actuated by
the came motives.

Again we are told, that the well disposed part of mankind are rendered
more virtuous, and the vicious less vicious by this doctrine. How are
we to know that? If the virtuous man acts uprightly, does good to his
fellow creatures, restrains his passions, and returns good for evil,
experience teaches him it is his interest so to do. Those who are
viciously disposed are only deterred from crime by penal laws. Societies
cannot long exist, where evil has the ascendency. Without social
laws, this would really be the case, notwithstanding the threats of an
avenging God. If men were told they would not be answerable for the evil
committed in this life to human laws, but that God would punish them
after death, it is evident the human race would soon be exterminated.
On the other hand, tell them their crimes will never be punished by God,
or, in other words, there is no other God than NATURE, but that the laws
of men will avenge the offences against society; so long as those
laws are administered with justice and impartiality, so long will such
society continue to improve. Hence it is evident that the system which
will maintain order in society by itself, must be the best and most
rational. A good government without religion would be more solid and
lasting, and tend more to the preservation of mankind, than all the
theocratical or ecclesiastical governments that ever the world was
subject to.--Thus much for the opponents of atheism.

It has been asserted with a perverse obstinacy, by the advocates for the
existence of a deity, that the SYSTEM OF NATURE was never written by
the author whose name it bears.--It is granted that it was not published
during his life: but that circumstance forms no reason why such a
conclusion should be drawn. The persecutions which the atheists have
endured, were a sufficient excuse for the work not appearing in any form
during the life time of its venerable author. The Athenians sought to
try Diagoras the Melian, for atheism; but he fled from Athens, and a
price was offered for his head. Protagoras was banished from Athens, and
his books burnt, because he ventured to assert, that he knew nothing of
the gods. Stephen Dolet was burnt at Paris for atheism. Giordano Bruno
was burnt by the Inquisitors in Italy. Lucilio Vanini was burnt at
Thoulouse, through the kind offices of an Attorney-General. Bayle
was under the necessity of fleeing to Holland. Casimio Liszynski was
executed at Grodno;--and Akenhead at Edinborough. And the body of the
eloquent and erudite Hume, was obliged to be watched many nights by his
friends, lest it should be taken up by the fanatics, who considered him
one of the greatest monsters of iniquity, because he did not happen to
believe as they believed.--With these pictures of Christian persecution
before his eyes, is it surprising that M. de Mirabaud should adopt the
resolution of suffering the SYSTEM OF NATURE to appear as a posthumous
work? That the same fate would have attended him, the most devout
Christian will not undertake to deny.

However the sentiments of M. de Mirabaud may be condemned by the
fanatics, all those who knew him bear the most brilliant testimony of
his integrity, candour, and the soundness of his understanding; in a
word, to his social virtues, and the innocence of his manners. He died
universally regretted, at Paris, the twenty-fourth of June, 1760, in the
eighty-sixth year of his age.

The following works, written by him at different periods, were never
published:--_The Life of Jesus Christ. Impartial Reflections on the
Gospel. The Morality of Nature. An Abridged History of the Priesthood;
Ancient and Modern. The Opinions of the Ancients concerning the Jews._ A
wretched mutilated edition of this last work was published at Amsterdam,
in 1740, in two small volumes, under the title of _Miscellaneous
Dissertations_.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
